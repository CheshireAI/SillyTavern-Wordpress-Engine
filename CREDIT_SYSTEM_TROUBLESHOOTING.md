# Credit System Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Orders Not Automatically Adding Credits

**Problem**: Orders with credit products are not automatically adding credits when completed or when status changes to "processing". Credits are only added when manually processed from the admin settings.

**Affected Orders**: 
- Order 11744: Image Credits (100) + Text Credits (10,000) - Status: processing
- Order 11745: Text Credits (10,000) - Status: processing

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be **WooCommerce hook execution failure**. Even though the hooks are registered, they may not be firing properly when orders are created or status changes occur.

## Diagnostic Tools Available

### 1. Test WooCommerce Hooks
**Purpose**: Verify that all WooCommerce hooks are properly registered
**Location**: Admin Settings â†’ Credit System Configuration â†’ "Test WooCommerce Hooks"
**What it does**: Checks if all required hooks are registered and accessible

### 2. Test Hook Execution
**Purpose**: Verify that WooCommerce hooks are actually firing and executing
**Location**: Admin Settings â†’ Credit System Configuration â†’ "Test Hook Execution"
**What it does**: Manually triggers a test hook to see if the system responds

### 3. Debug Order Credits
**Purpose**: Analyze a specific order to see why credits weren't added
**Location**: Admin Settings â†’ Credit System Configuration â†’ "Debug Order Credits"
**What it does**: Shows detailed information about an order's credit processing status

### 4. Check Processing Orders
**Purpose**: Find orders with "processing" status that need credits
**Location**: Admin Settings â†’ Credit System Configuration â†’ "Check Processing Orders"
**What it does**: Scans for processing orders and identifies any that need credits processed

### 5. Process Specific Order
**Purpose**: Manually process credits for a specific order ID
**Location**: Admin Settings â†’ Credit System Configuration â†’ "Process Specific Order"
**What it does**: Forces credit processing for a specific order (useful for testing orders 11744/11745)

### 6. Comprehensive Order Audit
**Purpose**: Scan all orders to find any that need credits processed
**Location**: Admin Settings â†’ Credit System Configuration â†’ "Audit All Orders"
**What it does**: Comprehensive scan of all orders to identify and process missed credits
