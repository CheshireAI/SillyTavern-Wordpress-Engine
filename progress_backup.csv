I now have an editor, so you all shouldn't need to put up with my typos and poor/dyslexic editing skills anymore.

""No way."" Ethan shook his head as he considered the possibility that his redheaded wife was the direct daughter of a dragon, making Lord Delmar that dragon. ""No, no there's not a chance in hell.""

""Why?"" Beth asked.

""Because he would've had to use a disguise gem for... for forever."" He replied. ""Anyone who wants to can see through mine. And even if he had a better one,

someone

would've seen through it by now.""

""What about Elder Goman though?"" Kendra countered. ""Right before he sent me back with the weapons, we talked about his disguise-- well, it's not a gem; it's a piece of dragon steel. A large piece.""

""How big?"" Alana asked.

""About like this."" Kendra indicated a three inch circle with her hands. ""And maybe half an inch thick.""

The wood elf whistled. ""That's enough dragon steel to take a

major

enchantment.""

The dragon huntress nodded. ""And he said that no one had seen through his disguise so far, and he socializes with some of the most powerful magic-users of our age.""

Ethan looked at Rachel, who looked frozen.

He stepped over to her and put a hand on her shoulder. ""Are you okay?""

She looked at him with wide eyes and worked her mouth for several seconds before she finally got a single word out. ""Speed.""

""What about it?"" He asked.

She worked her jaw soundlessly for several seconds until Alana came up and took her hand.

""Hey, it's okay. We're all here for you.""

The redhead nodded, then took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""Speed. The day I first heard of you two--"" She indicated Ethan and Alana. ""--he was so fast.""

""Who was?"" Ethan asked.

""My father."" She nearly whispered. ""He encircled me in a ring of fire and I air-rammed my way out. But before I could take a step he'd already..."" She covered her mouth. ""He was already in front of me. He moved faster than the air-ram; faster than anything I've ever seen except...""

""Except...?"" Ethan prompted, but he was pretty sure he knew what she was going to say.

He was right.

""Except Kyrupto."" Rachel finished. ""My father moved as fast as a..."" She shook her head. ""I always wondered how he did it, but I never thought that... how could he...?"" She looked at her husband, eyes wide and looking like a lost, scared little girl. ""Help.""

He pulled her into a hug, though he made sure the redhead could still hold Alana's hand as he did so.

She did.

He could actually see the wood elf's hand turning slightly white from the pressure and a slight grimace of pain on the brunette's face, but Alana made no effort to extricate her hand. On the contrary, she introduced her other hand to hold her best friend's hand more closely.

""The black dragon."" Kendra breathed.

""What?"" Ethan looked at her.

""The black dragon."" The dragon huntress repeated. ""Dragons don't usually work together. A Drago might force a weaker dragon to work for him, but dragons of similar power levels don't usually work together for long. Well, not closely anyway; they just don't. The black dragon has been working closely with Lord Delmar for years. If Lord Delmar is a dragon, and dragons don't work together long term, then logically...""

She let that hang in the air.

""Holy shit."" Ethan breathed, still holding the woman who he now realized was almost certainly the black dragon's daughter. ""Holy fucking shit.""

For almost a whole minute, he held Rachel while everyone else just stared wordlessly at each other.

No one moved.

No one spoke.

No one even closed their mouths, which were universally all hanging open.

""I... I don't... wow."" Ethan finally managed to get out, but he wasn't sure how to finish the sentence. He looked down at the mass of red hair that slowly faded to blonde at the tips.

Wow.

That was just...

Wow.

""Hey beautiful."" He whispered into her ear once he'd collected himself. ""How you holdin' up?""

She lifted her head to look into his eyes. She had such big, beautiful, blue eyes. They were absolutely captivating, and right now looked like a deer in the headlights mixed with a sad, lost, and frightened little puppy.

""Hey, how's my wise redhead?"" He asked again, reaching up and cupping her face in his hands. ""How's she doing?""

""She's... uh, she's... um..."" Rachel blinked several times.

""In shock?"" He offered.

She nodded, her lip quivering slightly. He leaned in and planted a tender kiss on her forehead.

""Hey, I've got you."" He said softly as he drew her into a hug again. He caught Alana's eye, and tilted his head to indicate that she should come closer. The wood elf did, and made Rachel the center of a 'hug sandwich'. The redhead seemed to let out a sigh of relief at his first wife's closeness. He didn't say anything about the revelation because he didn't know what to say.

He just held her.

He held her close, gently stroked her hair, and let everything he felt for her leak across their bond so she could feel it.

After several seconds, she spoke. ""I'm the daughter of your mortal enemy.""

""And I love you very much."" He replied.

""I'm the daughter of a dragon."" She whispered.

""Yes you are, the baby in Alana's womb is too, and Alana herself if you go back far enough."" He said softly. ""And I still love you all very much.""

She pulled back slightly to look at him, searching his eyes. After several seconds, she spoke. ""None of this changes how you feel about me, does it?""

""No."" He said gently, but firmly. ""Not one bit. And even if it did -- which it doesn't -- it still wouldn't change the fact that I married you. That means I stick around in good times and bad; for better or worse. I would be here for you even if it did change the way I felt about you, which again it doesn't.""

She gave him a half smile. ""It changes how I feel about myself though.""

""Oh?""

""I... I don't..."" Her breath hitched and she swallowed hard before continuing. ""I don't have the words to explain right now.""

""Okay."" He nodded, then gently stroked her face with the back of his hand. ""I won't push, but let me know when you're ready to talk about it.""

He looked at her for a long moment, recognizing that she was easily both the strongest and weakest of his wives at the same time. She had a profound strength of will that rivaled Alana's; perhaps even exceeded it. However, underneath that tough exterior she was still a nineteen year old girl who'd never been properly loved as a child, leading to emotional scars and the walls she had built to protect herself.

She nodded, then thought to him: *Thank you my lord, for not pushing, for letting me...* She swallowed. *I really appreciate it.*

*I'll always be here for you.* He smiled back. *Always.*

She gave him a smile as her face twisted slightly like she was about to cry. He pulled her close again and just held her.

He didn't know what else to do.

Sarah winced slightly as the old woman carefully made a tiny slice in her skin with a small, razor sharp knife, then held a glass vial under it to catch the tiny trickle of blood.

""What's that for?"" The innkeeper's daughter asked, trying not to fight too hard; the old woman had promised that it would hurt much worse if she fought.

""Drawing blood."" She replied. ""I can't figure out what powers those muscles without examining you."" Something about her tone was excited, and her eyes twinkled as she looked at the tablespoon or so of Sarah's blood in the glass vial.

""It's..."" Sarah faltered, wanting to explain but having trouble admitting it out loud.

""Yes I know you think it's a demon."" The old woman laughed mirthlessly. ""I'll forgive your backwards thinking since you clearly don't know better. Ah, that should do it."" She removed the glass vial which was now mostly full with perhaps two tablespoons of blood, then put her hand over the cut mark. Sarah's skin tingled for a moment, then the flow of blood slowed, and then stopped altogether.

The old woman had healed her.

""Thank you."" Sarah said, relieved that she wouldn't be bleeding until the wound healed naturally.

The old woman gave her a strange look, then shook her head and carried the vial over to one of the tables covered with strange instruments. Sarah craned her neck to watch since she didn't have anything else to do. The old woman dropped a single drop of blood onto a small piece of glass, then set another piece of glass over the first one, making the drop of blood spread. Then she slid the pieces of glass under a strange contraption.

The contraption had a dozen different magnifying glasses in successively smaller and smaller sizes. They were arranged all in a row, and Sarah couldn't even imagine how magnified they could make things. The glass with the blood was slid into a slot under the final lens, and the old woman looked through the top lens.

""Hmm, seems normal to me..."" The old woman mused.

""It does?"" The Innkeeper's daughter asked.

""Oh dear."" The old woman looked at her. ""What little secrets are you hiding? Best to tell me now because I will find them.""

Sarah gulped.

Ethan flopped down on the bed in the captain's cabin, hoping that Rachel would be okay. He figured she would be eventually, but right now she was a hot mess. He almost smiled at the accidental double entendre, then he shook his head. She'd wandered away to the front of the Argo with Alana in tow. He felt like he should be there for her, but she seemed to want some space right now.

*Hey, is Rachel okay?* He asked his first wife.

*I think she will be eventually.* Alana replied. *I think it's just shock now, so I'll watch over her for a bit. Relax, I know you're worried, but she'll talk when she's ready.*

*Okay, thanks.* He laid his head back and closed his eyes.

What a day.

Hell, what a week... or month... or at this point, basically three months.

*Master, could I join you?* Taloni's voice was tentative, and he was pretty sure she was still hanging around on the weather deck.

*You never need to ask honey.* He thought back smiling.

Moments later, the captain's cabin door opened and he looked up -- since he was laying on his back with his head towards the door -- to see the Fey teen slip into the room and close the door behind her. It was slightly odd from that perspective, since visually she appeared to be upside down.

""May I take off my clothes and snuggle with you master?"" She asked with a shy smile.

How could she be so shy after being married to him and sharing a bed with him and his other wives for so long? There was something innocent about her shyness though, and a part of him hoped it would never fully fade.

""Oh honey, you literally

never

need to ask that; the answer is always yes.""

She beamed, then reached back and untied her halter-top dress, letting it fall and then slipping out of the matching lilac shorts that Alana had so wisely made to protect the Fey's modesty when she flew. She padded over to the bed, hopped up and her wings were a blur for a moment as she used them to get herself into position so she could lay next to him, and then she snuggled up against his side. He put his arm around her and kissed the top of her head, which was resting on his chest.

""I miss this."" He sighed.

""Miss what master?""

""This; snuggling like this."" He sighed. ""Do you remember the night... nights? When it was just you and Alana, and I held you on either side like this?""

""Of course master, it was so wonderful.""

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, then shook his head. ""I have too many wives.""

""What?"" She looked alarmed.

""Sorry, I don't mean I want fewer, and if anyone tried to take any of my wives from me I'd rip them--""

""--limb from limb."" Taloni finished quickly as she winced, but looked relieved. ""I know you will protect us master, I just don't know what you mean about having too many wives.""

""Take you for example."" He replied, looking down into her beautiful lilac eyes. ""We spent a bunch of time on you when we freed you and afterward, but then it was about bringing Beth back, then Kyrupto attacked which brought out some things with Rachel, there was everything with Alana's family in Nalatia, everything with Rachel afterward while we were captured, Alana's family again, then Beth's dad summons us, then Sarah, and then everything in Gralden. I only just realized it, but I feel like I've ignored you a bit.""

""You haven't master."" She snuggled closer to him. ""Your other wives just needed more of your time lately, that's all.""

He shook his head. ""That's actually my point; time. I literally don't have the time to spend enough time with each of you. I'd never give any of you up. Ever. But..."" He sighed.

""But you're saying that time-wise, you have too many wives."" She made a thoughtful sound.

""Yeah."" He sighed again, feeling a bit exhausted from the day, and his mind drifted to the earlier conversation with Drousin, which led to a rabbit trail about his dragon problems, which naturally led his mind to thinking about the one woman he'd met who could sympathize with them. He felt an ironic grin form on his face as he realized that rather a lot of his mind's rabbit trails led to the innkeeper's daughter.

""Sarah?"" Taloni asked as she affectionately rubbed her cheek on the smooth scales of his chest and snuggled closer.

""How did you know?""

""You aren't nearly as hard to read as you think you are master."" She gave him a sly grin. ""Besides, she'll make a great wife for you.""

He shook his head. ""She's betrothed. But even if she wasn't, what in God's name am I thinking even

considering

another wife when I don't have time for the ones I currently have.""

""Actually, isn't 'in God's name' appropriate?"" The Fey teen countered.

""Come again?""

""Didn't Illuminar say that you would have seven wives master?""

""Don't remind me."" He groaned. ""I can barely keep up with four.""

""Pardon me for disagreeing master, but isn't it a good thing that you're reminded?""

""You never need to apologize for disagreeing, and maybe?"" He tapped one of his fingers on his scales. It made a satisfying 'clicking' sound, but didn't actually help him think better. ""I suppose I see Kendra being wife number five. And I imagine that if we're really going to beat Smithbond, then I'll have to marry Selene too so we can communicate while she's on Earth. Still, I just don't have enough time for you, Alana, Beth, and Rachel now; how the hell will I cope with Kendra, Selene, and whoever the last wife is?""

Taloni made a thoughtful sound, then thought to everyone. *Ladies, do you feel like master doesn't give you enough time?*

*No, why?* Alana replied.

*I've never felt like that.* Beth added.

*Nor I.* Rachel agreed, though she seemed distracted and it took her several seconds longer to reply.

Kendra didn't say anything.

*Thank you.* The Fey teen thought to them, then looked at her husband and beamed. ""You're doing just fine master. I know I'm happy. All I wanted my whole life was to not be a slave and to travel on an airship. You not only freed me, but now I'm learning to become an airship pilot and I have the best sisters--"" she cocked her head to one side. ""--well, fellow wives but they seem more like sisters; but they're the best fellow wives I could ask for, and a wonderful husband who loves me very much.""

""I do."" He smiled at her.

She smiled back. ""I'm very happy master, and I think the rest of your wives are too, even if you feel like you don't give us enough time.""

He made a noncommittal grunt, but wasn't convinced.

Not by a long shot.

* * *

Kendra leaned up against the Argo's railing on the quarterdeck, thinking back to the revealing conversation about Rachel's father. Oddly, she found that the redhead's parentage didn't bother her much, if at all. It wasn't Rachel's fault. And other than a bit of jealousy that the teen mage could resist Ethan's compulsion because of her ancestry, it just didn't matter to her.

""You decided to stay."" Anthiel commented from the ship's wheel.

She turned to face the high elf. ""Yeah, I kind of made the Argo my home.""

""Even with what's likely to happen between you and Ethan?""

She hesitated, then nodded. ""I hate it, but there's nothing for it.""

The high elf raised an eyebrow.

""What?"" She raised her hands, palms up. ""There isn't.""

The pilot got a knowing smile on her face and nodded slowly, but somehow the dragon huntress didn't think she was convinced.

""What?""

""I didn't say anything."" Anthiel replied with an amused smile.

""Well, you were 'not saying it' very loudly.""

""I just think it's interesting that you've finally decided to marry him, that's all.""

""I did not.""

Anthiel gave Kendra a look that a parent might give a child who was insisting that he hadn't taken a sweet roll while his face and fingers were covered in the icing. ""You knew that if you stayed on the Argo, Ethan will take you to bed; yet you remained on the Argo.""

""That's not marriage though, not really.""

Anthiel raised her eyebrow.

""It's not; no vows.""

""Ah, because binding your soul to someone and then sharing the most physically intimate experience that a man and woman can share to cement that bond is less of a commitment than vows."" She nodded slowly, that annoyingly amused smile still on her face. ""I see now.""

Kendra gave her a look.

* * *

Rachel stared out across the plains in front of the Argo, trying to collect her thoughts. It was harder than normal, which was saying something. They hadn't passed into Ivernia yet, so the ground beneath them was green, but not quite the vibrant, verdant green that she'd recently learned to associate with the place. The ground beneath them was soothing as it scrolled by, but it didn't change the facts.

Her father was a dragon.

Not just any dragon, but almost certainly the black dragon.

How?

She slowly shook her head for the... Dozenth time? Hundredth time? It would've been unbelievable if it didn't make so much sense. The speed her father had moved the day he'd tasked her with tracking down Ethan and Alana, the lack of dragon problems in her father's lands, the fact that the black dragon seemingly only worked to increase her father's standing; everything. It all fit perfectly together. It all made sense...

And yet...

She shook her head.

""Rachel?"" A tentative voice came from behind her.

The redhead smiled; it was Alana. The mage turned to see her best friend standing there looking a bit unsure. She was biting her lip and her hands were clasped in front of her.

""Are you okay?"" The wood elf asked.

Rachel took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""I will be, eventually... I think""

""I'm glad."" She smiled. ""Mind if I join you?""

""Please."" Rachel stepped to one side to make room for Alana at the front of the Argo, where the ship's port and starboard railings met in the center.

Somehow, completely naturally, they ended up with their arms touching. Rachel liked that. She liked Alana. The wood elf was easily the best woman she'd ever known, and that was saying something when you considered all the incredible women she'd met since joining Ethan; his other wives especially.

There was just something about her that was so attractive.

Rachel knew that some women were romantically attracted to other women of course, but she wasn't. But if she was ever going to be, it would be to Alana. There was just something about her spirit that was captivating. She was so strong and yet so kind; so tender and yet so fierce. She cared so much, and yet wasn't overbearing in her caring. The combination was just so...

So...

Captivating.

Plus, she had these gorgeous, rich hazel eyes. Eyes that looked at her like she was something incredibly valuable that she treasured deeply. Rachel felt the same way about her.",,2025-08-15T18:46:05.376107,3540,
https://www.literotica.com/s/noras-house-ch-05,Nora's House Ch. 05,Unknown Author,,,,,"Rob Thompson - Summer 2024

By Friday, the only thing on my mind was leaving work early and heading to Nora's. Even though we had most of the last few evenings together, making sure the house would be ready for her party on Saturday, there were still finishing touches needed.

During the week, a crew from Thomas' company had managed to bring the swimming pool back to a usable state. Nora's father himself had spent a lot of time around too. The renovations were advancing faster than ever, at the cost of time for Nora and I to be alone.

As a result I had yet to find myself back to being tied up in her bed, I could almost feel the emptiness around my wrists and ankles. On top of that I had to spend most of Monday night talking Nora down from the high she had gotten from the pictures Emma and I had sent of our dalliance.

Seeing Nora so titillated by our hookup was a welcome change from the repressed anger that had oozed out of her last time around. Especially since Emma had shown up at my place in the middle of the night for a tipsy booty call on Wednesday, which I had yet to inform Nora of.

All of that left me eagerly applying a new layer of varnish to the porch. The sooner I was finished there, the sooner Nora would be able to take her ownership over me back, as she had planned for me to spend the next three nights here. All I could think about was how it would feel to slide back under her control.

Someone clearing their throat behind me pulled me from my thoughts, leaving me a little startled. I got up and turned around to find Mister Anderson, from the HOA. The sun was beating down on me, and I had discarded my shirt leaving me to wear only pants and painting gloves. Would he start to think that I spent all my time half-naked?

The portly man was looking at me, but he must have steeled himself before approaching, because this time around he was able to maintain eye contact.

""Mister Thompson."" I took my gloves off, and shook the hand he was offering. ""Do you know where I might find Miss Jennings?""

This did not presage anything good. ""She's on the run to the hardware store with her dad right now."" I quickly checked behind him, but both the front yard and pavement were clear of any debris. What could he want with Nora?

""Well that's unfortunate."" He continued in a formal tone. ""Word reached us that a pool has been installed in the backyard. As per the Association's guidelines, a state-accredited auditor has been assigned to inspect the property tomorrow. They will expect the pool to be emptied.""

This was not just bad, it was cataclysmic. Nora had planned her housewarming as a pool party for months now. We would never have time to empty it and refill it in time. She was already stressed out enough as was, if this went through I only imagine our play time fading in the distance.

""On a Saturday?"" I tried to keep the anguish out of my voice. ""This has to be crazy expensive. Surely it could wait until after the weekend."" I had heard about overzealous HOA's on the internet before, but this seemed insane.

""You must understand, this is a question of safety for Miss Jennings' neighbors. The Association takes such matters very seriously."" He shifted uncomfortably, clearly trying to remain professional but not immune to my obvious disappointment

""But the pool was already there when she bought the house. This has to be a mistake."" If desperation could reveal someone's true character, I hated what the idea that had just bloomed in my mind said about me.

I grabbed his the hand, which took him by surprise and put a damper on his counter argument. ""Come with me I'll show you, the pool's no danger."" With a big smile, and a slight tilt of my head I pulled him in, enticing him to follow me.

We briskly made our way to the patio on the back of the house. Mister Anderson was looking at me with bewildered eyes. He had clearly caught the shift in my demeanor.

""See, it's really nice out here."" I led him to the outdoor table and pulled a chair out from under it. ""Why don't you take a seat Mister."" My voice was dripping with honey, I put a gentle hand on his shoulder, the physical contact sending a visible shiver through his neck.

He sat down, and I knelt next to him, crossing my arms over the armrest. His mouth was open and he was staring at me, breathing heavily.

""I know it would be so much work for you to reschedule the inspection."" I was looking straight up at him, smiling as innocently as I could. ""But I'm sure we could agree on a way for me to help motivate you."" I moved one hand to his thigh.

He swallowed hard. ""I uh.. I'm not sure I follow you.."" His voice did sound unsure, but there was plenty of evidence that the rest of his body was reading my intentions. I rested my hand on his bulge, rubbing softly through the material.

""He knows what I mean."" The contact of my fingers through his jeans made him let a deep, low breath out. I slowly undid his zipper. ""What do you say Mister? Will you help Nora out if I take care of our friend here.""

He stared at me blankly for a few seconds. I was terrified, had I been too direct, too quick, would he tell Nora? But just as my courage was about to desert me, he gave me an eager nod. I did not need to be told twice.

The cock I fished from his pants was thick, if a little short, surrounded by a nest of thick hair. He was already hard, and I began to rub him with one hand, while the other was running over his thigh. I slowly brought my face closer to him, making sure that my warm breath would hit his sensitive skin.

Just as I was on the verge of taking him in, I looked up. His head had lolled back, his mouth hanging open, reveling in my touch. ""If I were you, I'd look down right about now."" I could hear my own smile. I was starting to get into the moment, my pants starting to feel restrictive.

Tilting my head to the side, to be able to keep looking in his eyes, I finally took him in my mouth. He was the very image of a man who could not believe what was happening to him. The taste of his cock was not too bad, but I was still doing my best to distract myself from it, focusing on how much fun it would be to tell Nora about that encounter later.

For a few moments I gently bobbed my head up and down on his lap, my tongue diligently working towards his release. But I could not have predicted what Mister Anderson would do next.

All of a sudden his hands were on the back of my head, pulling me deeper into his crotch. With me pressed against him like that, he got up from the chair. I almost fell down, one hand catching the table while my other arm wrapped around his thigh, before I could find my balance on my heels.

Any fear I felt over the loss of control in the situation was immediately overshadowed by the immense arousal it caused in me. Without saying a word, he started to pump his hips into my face, masturbating himself with my mouth.

With his new position, whenever he would put his entire length in me, my nose would find itself deep into his pubes. This brought me back to the sensations I had gotten from Nora using me in her parent's dining room.

Mister Anderson was able to quickly bring himself to his climax. He dug himself into me, his hairy balls resting on my chin. But as he could not reach my throat, when his cock started to pulse it was the inside of my mouth that filled with his pungent seed, leaving me to swallow as fast as I could, lest it leaked out of me and on my face.

He exhaled loudly and pumped into me a few more times, milking the remainder of his orgasm, before letting go of my head. I was breathless, now sitting on the patio, looking at him incredulously.

It was his turn to be the one seemingly unphased by the situation. ""I'll notify Miss Jennings of the new inspection date via text message."" With that he left without looking back, walking as if nothing had happened. Why had he even bothered to show up in the first place if he could have texted Nora all along?

I sat dumbfounded, leaning against the foot of the table. The energy of the encounter was beginning to fade, and leaving me forced to confront some uncomfortable feelings. I had never shied away from sleeping with someone I was not attracted to before, either for attention or to keep a relationship going. But it had never felt so transactional, so clearly one sided.

Shame was on the verge of overcoming me when I remembered who I had done it for. Nora would be glad that I helped her. I would recount what I did, and she would explain why she was okay with it. In my head I could even imagine her masturbating while listening to me.

With this new certitude I got up to my feet, and opened the patio door to the kitchen. I needed something to clear the taste from my mouth. Inside the fridge, the plastic carton of milk caught my eye. I took a swig from it, welcoming the expected sugary hit, swirling it around to make sure I got rid of any remaining proof.

The taste of the almond milk was bringing back the memory of Nora, gently feeding me with her baby bottle. Soon I would be back under her thumb where everything made sense. For a moment I was tempted to take care of the tightness in my pants, before thinking better of it. This was Nora's house, she would get to decide what to do with my orgasm.

I took a few more sips, and as I was putting the bottle back into the fridge, heard the front door open.

With a spring in my step I made my way there, Nora was carrying a large canvas bag from the hardware store.

""Hey Rob! Dad's gone home!"" Despite how much I liked Thomas, I could not help but smile at the news. Finally alone.

""Need any help unloading the car?"" I then took a suggestive pose, still not wearing a shirt. ""Or would you rather I lose the pants first?""

Nora bit her lip, before looking uncomfortable. ""Actually Rob, I think it would be better if you put your clothes back on."" It was like the floor was opening under my feet, ready to toss me back into a pit of shame. ""I still have a lot to do tonight, why don't you head home and take a break. You've already done so much this week.""

I was dumbfounded. ""But I thought we would get some time together?""

""I know Robbie, and I'm gutted too. But I really need to clean some things up and you're way too distracting for me to get anything done quickly when you're around."" Seeing the disappointment on my face she added with a suggestive smile. ""Distracting in the best way possible, of course.""

She pulled me into a hug, that I returned limply, my heart clearly not in it. ""Ugh! I needed that. Thanks Robbie. Have a good night's sleep and we'll spend all day together tomorrow. The party is going to be so fun, you'll see."" She ended our embrace, and put a kiss on my cheek before lugging her bag towards the basement.

With nothing more to be said, I picked up my shirt on the porch and went for my car.

Rob Thompson - Summer 2024

Emma and I were making out on my couch, in our underwear. I had texted her to meet me before I was even out of Nora's driveway. She had made it to my place faster than me, and I had found her sitting on the landing, waiting for me with a smile.

She had not asked why I was suddenly free that night, or what I had planned for us. She was simply happy to spend time with me. This was how it was supposed to be when someone liked you.

Her enthusiasm felt so much more vivid after Nora's cold dismissal. We had taken a shower together, made some food and put a movie on we both knew was just an excuse, now reduced to background noise.

But today seemed determined not to let me have even that uncomplicated moment. My phone rang, and Emma picked it up. She grinned seeing the name on the screen before answering.

""Mister Robert's phone, this is Emma speaking."" I smiled at her carefree tone, but the joke would have landed better had she known my last name. Did I know hers? ""Of course Miss Jennings, I'll put you through to him momentarily.""

She handed me the phone, beaming from ear to ear, unaware that my heart had just dropped in my stomach.

""Hey Nora.""

""You didn't waste any time,"" her voice teasing and warm, but I was in no mood.

""I thought you had to focus on the house?"" I was trying not to sound too bitter, but anger still made its way into my words. Emma had laid her head on my chest, seemingly watching the movie, but I knew her attention was on me, curious to hear what was going on. There was no point in letting my frustration with Nora spill over and ruin the mood for her too.

""Yeah about that..."" Her voice made it clear she was trying to choose her next words carefully. ""That was a bit of an excuse. I'm sorry, I would have loved nothing more than some Robbie time tonight. But the party tomorrow is stressing me out so much, I don't think I could've gotten in the right mood.""

Great, I had a hard time with her rejection earlier, but at least I could understand it. Now I just felt like another chore, on the list of things that were weighing on her mind.

""I could have helped with that."" I hoped only Nora would catch my distress, Emma hearing just half of the conversation.

""I know sweetheart. I get the week's been tough for you too. I'm sorry."" Nora's voice softened, trying to smooth things over.

The movie must have been even more boring than it sounded, because Emma started to wiggle on me, clumsily crawling down my body. I was starting to relax into Nora's apology, when she suddenly pulled down my boxers.

""Anyway, we'll get to spend the whole weekend together, it's not so bad."" Nora's voice was calming me, just as Emma's mouth wrapped around my soft cock.

Before I could even process the sensation, Nora continued, ""Oh my God, I didn't tell you yet! I just got a text from Mr. Anderson, you know the HOA guy.""

My heart skipped a beat. What had he told her? But then Emma took me deeper, her wet mouth warm and eager, it was hard to keep my focus, but I had to know.

""Oh yeah?"" I was trying hard to keep my voice even. ""What did he want?"" I could feel myself grow hard in Emma's mouth.

""Apparently some inspector has to come check out the pool. Sounds like boilerplate stuff, but they'll need me here on Tuesday."" She then continued on a more light-hearted, mischievous tone. ""I freaked out when I first saw the notification. I thought I was about to get fined or something, can you imagine?""

Nora's obliviousness of what had happened was warming my heart. Despite her recent rejection, she had taken good care of me since we had started to play together. I was glad to be the one helping her for once. Should I tell her? Let her know how far I had been willing to go to serve her? Would she enjoy the story, or be horrified by my actions?

A big slurping noise coming from between my legs pulled me from my wandering thoughts. Emma would certainly not enjoy hearing me talk about going down on an ugly man to help out my 'platonic' friend.

Without waiting for my input, Nora picked the conversation back up, talking about mundane stuff she would need to do or had already planned for the week. A lot of these, but not all, included me. Her voice made it clear that she was just happy to talk to me, to wind down a little together, despite the distance.

I felt a flicker of guilt. My irritation from earlier seemed excessive. Her recent dominant streak had made her appear so in control, so composed, that I had forgotten everyone could use a night off once in a while.

Even with all my goodwill, Emma's diligence made it hard for me to focus on Nora's words. Her brown hair had cascaded around her face, hiding the exact nature of her ministrations, but I could feel her tongue, lips and fingers working all over my cock and balls. From time to time I would have to suppress a moan, until I could not anymore.

Both of them caught it, Emma looking up from her task to beam at me, Nora sounding shocked on the phone.

""What was that?"" It must have dawned on her that I had not talked in a while. ""Rob, are you still there?"" It was like she had forgotten that Emma was at my place.

I scrambled for an answer, flattening my voice as best I could. ""Uh yeah, just a bit distracted.""

Before I could hear Nora's answer, Emma snatched my phone away from me. She brought it to her ear with one hand, while the other mindlessly stroked my cock.

""Hey again Nora, sorry about that."" She paused to smack a light peck on my tip, listening to what I could imagine being a very flustered answer from Nora, which made her giggle. ""Yeah pretty much, you've guessed it."" Another pause, with another touch of her lips on my throbbing dick. ""Yes, the entire time you've been speaking. Listen, tell me if you can recognize the noise.""

With that she went back to sucking me, making an exaggerated moan that sent warm vibrations along my hard member. But she did not keep at it for long, pulling her head back up, leaving my wet cock in the cold air.

""See?"" Emma's grin widened as she listened back to the phone, her eyes on mine, a mischievous spark in them. Her little display was mesmerizing me, and I was too afraid of breaking her momentum to do anything.

""Yeah, he's pretty much naked, I still have my bra and panties on... Aye aye, captain."" She set the phone on my lap, shooting me a look that made it clear I should not reach for it, and straightened her back a little.

She tossed her long hair over her shoulders, giving me a direct view of her plain black bra. One of her hands went to the clasp, while the other covered the cups, and maintained it against her chest, even as the strap loosened up.

With a coy smile, Emma slowly slid her bra down her arms, and onto my chest. In doing so she had pressed her breasts together, which she finally released, biting her lip. Seeing the exposed pink nipples, pointing up proudly, I finally caved and reached to seize her perky mounds in my hands. Their hard tips tingling my palms are a striking contrast to the soft warmth of her skin.

A small moan escaped her lips, and she closed her eyes for a second, but she did not stop her show. Balancing herself on one knee, still straddling me on the narrow couch, she began to pull her panties down. As she was trying to get the garments over her second leg, she almost tumbled, but caught herself by pressing her chest even harder in my hands.

We shared a small laugh, and when she was finally naked, she came down on my chest, laying against me for a few moments of shared warmth. Before long she went back to her spot, between my legs, a longing look in her eyes, ready to bring Nora back with us.

""I'm back."" Emma was not looking at my face anymore, instead she had laid her head on my crotch, holding my cock in one hand while she nuzzled against its base. She did not have the same high strung energy from earlier, as if the intimate atmosphere of her strip tease had made her more subdued.

""No sorry I don't feel like taking pictures tonight."" Her tone sounded apologetic, and I was sure that if I could see her face, there would be a genuine disappointment in her soft features. ""I'm not wearing any makeup... Oh thanks, that's nice.""

I was surprised that such a little thing could make her so insecure. And hearing the shift in her enthusiasm made me a bit sad. I gently ran my hand through her hair, trying to sooth her. Emma looked up and shot me a grateful smile. I did not want to talk, but mouthed ""You look fucking sexy"" which lit up her face and brought back some of the spark in her eyes.

""No Nora, I'm sorry, I think for tonight you'll just have to listen in."" She was finding her footing again, pushing back against our friend on the phone. ""Yes ok, that sounds hot, that I can do.""

Emma's hands were full of confidence as she guided me to a new position. Through some arcane maneuvering, she managed to get me to shimmy down lower on the couch, my head flat against the cushion, one leg over the armrest the other hanging over the side. For her part, she knelt with a knee on each side of my head, facing my belly. I knew where this was going and I could not wait.",,2025-08-15T18:46:12.296978,3795,

*****

Cathy and Erin had been best friends since they'd first met as toddlers, though they could not be more different if they tried. Cathy liked rock and roll, Erin liked classical. Cathy was a long haired blond with something between a motherly, and hourglass figure. Erin had a well rounded education, long and thin features, and short black hair that sometimes hid her glasses. Cathy had fiery amber eyes and a playful grin. Erin had cool blue eyes with an awkward chuckle when she responded, ""No, not really, No.""

""What?"" Cathy was astounded, ""Still a virgin!""

""Shush!"" Erin tried to silence her. Some eyes from another table wondered over. ""It's no big deal!""

""You're thirty years old!"" Cathy loudly whispered. ""What's the holdup?""

Erin knew Cathy would be like this. She wouldn't have admitted it if not for the drinks, she should probably stop. ""I haven't found the right guy yet, I guess.""

""I know you want kids."" Cathy gave her a look. ""From the way you saw mine.""

""Your twins are so cute!"" Erin agreed. ""But I can wait.""

""Time is a wasting. You wont be young forever."" Erin knew that. ""You want someone like Todd?""

What kind of question was that? ""Todd is pretty great."" Erin agreed. ""If he has any twins please tell me.""

Cathy sighed.

""What?"" Erin asked.

""Nothing, just-"" Cathy shook her head. ""I've had too many drinks. I'm getting crazy.""

""Well, you know how I like crazy.""

""You really don't though.""

""Well I like hearing about it.""

Cathy laughed and traced a finger around the rim of her wine glass, ""Right, well, Todd and I were jokeing about you the other day. You know, He was saying he didn't know why you were single because you're so cute.""

""Dangerous thing to say to his wife.""

""I know what he meant."" She smiled, ""Anyways, we were having laugh so I said to Todd, you know, I love you, and we've been together for so long, so if you wanted to have Erin as a wife for a night, I wouldn't be opposed to that.""

Erin's eyes widened, ""What did he say?""

""He laughed."" She shrugged. ""I don't think he knew what to say.""

""I wouldn't either."" Erin chuckled. ""That's a hell of a loyalty test Cathy.""

""It wasn't really. Er, I mean, kind of. Actually."" Cathy started look anxious again. ""Yes. Yes it was."" She laughed. ""Let's talk about something else.""

Erin knew she was hiding something. And she knew exactly how to make her say it.

A few more drinks and jokes later she returned to the subject. Cathy continued, ""I mean, like,"" She was quite drunk now, ""I love you Erin. I love you so much!""

""I love you too."" Erin chuckled. Cathy was an opinionated drunk.

""And I love Todd too!"" She continued. ""And I love my kids! And I just want everybody to be happy!""

""It's not like it's your responsibility or anything."" Erin said.

""And I know you love Todd, and Todd loves you, and if you had kids with Todd, I'd love them too!""

""That's. um, Thank you?"" Where was Cathy going with this?

""And you know, it sounds weird. I know it sounds weird. Because it is weird. But, like, I see you as family, you know."" Erin let her rant, ""And it hurts when you hurt. And I just want to see Todd fuck your brains out."" She blinked and burst out into laughter, ""Shit! I said it!"" She giggled at herself, ""Oh boy I'm a weirdo!"" She snorted. ""Oh, wow,"" She blinked a few times. ""Oh, I don't feel so good.""

""Me neither."" Erin stared at her friend wide eyed. She hadn't had much more to drink but she was feeling lightheaded too. ""You, you want to see what now?"" Erin imagined the scene with a blush.

""You heard me!"" She swayed in her seat, ""I've imagined it for years! At first I thought it was just me being jealous, you know, like, you were better than me just because your fucking smart, and I'm fucking dumb as bricks. But then I realized how horny I was when I pretended he was bending you over instead of me. When I imagined Todd was fucking your pussy instead of mine. And I came. I came hard. It was fucking hot. And it scared me shitless. And I thought, like, maybe it would be better, you know? Maybe he deserves a brainy, smart, quirky girl and don't a dumb bimbo like me, and my brain knows it.""

""Cathy, you aren't dumb.""

""You graduated and I didn't!"" she pointed, ""And you're pretty. Not as pretty as me. Well, you know, a different kind of pretty. I'm like a monster tit, fat ass, it hurts to jog kind of pretty. You're more of a slender, long legs, tomboy pretty. And Todd might like that. And I always thought we'd do everything together Erin! You and me against the world baby! And then I got married, and I moved out of your place, and I didn't see you around and I knew I shouldn't feel lonely cause I'm married to the guy I love but I did! I felt really lonely cause you weren't there! And I thought, you know, maybe you could live with us! And I wouldn't have to do all this wife stuff alone! But that's stupid. I'm stupid!"" She rested her head on the table. ""Stupid. Stupid. Dumb!"" She rolled her forehead on the wood. ""Why is sex so hard?""

""You aren't stupid!"" Erin shook her. ""I mean,"" Erin searched her own feelings. ""I felt a little lonely without you too. And I know we can't do everything together. But it's not that weird that you-"" She stopped. ""And you're asleep."" She sighed. Cathy was drooling and unconscious. ""Great. Probably wont remember any of this either. Perfect.""

--

Erin thought about Todd. She'd never thought about Todd like this before. In fact, she wasn't even used to thinking about sex like this before. Masturbation was not common for her. She was usually too busy and it made her too sad afterwards. She looked at her naked body in the mirror. She knew she wasn't very pretty. She reminded herself of an insect. Big eyes, thin arms and legs, and a nose that was too pointy for her likeing. She winced at her tits. They looked too pointy too. She had short black hair, and as she looked at her naked form in the mirror she reignited her old envy of Cathy's curves. All through school Cathy told her she'd grow into them, but even now at thirty she had two pathetic pear sized beasts. Her ass was average, at least. But since she was a bit taller than average it wasn't anything special.

There was nothing obviously wrong with her, she supposed. But she wasn't sexy. Not like Cathy. She squatted down and felt like her body was folding like a contortionist. Compared to Cathy, she felt like a skeleton with skin. She knew it wasn't that bad, but being around her for so long didn't help. She felt like her limbs were too long, especially her legs. She wasn't unhealthy. She was just slender.

But then she remembered Cathy's words. She said Erin was pretty. She tried to see herself differently. She'd never considered that she'd be a part of anyone's sexual fantasy. Now she saw herself as Elf-like, or angelic. The thought made her smile. She stood and went to one of her bathroom drawers under the sink. It had been a gag gift years ago, but now Erin could think of little else. Without her glasses she couldn't read the labels, but she knew exactly where and what it was.

With comically absurd jokes and adds and disclaimers that it was merely a model, Erin took a look at the dildo she received on her twenty fifth birthday. It was still in the box. She gulped and tore it open. She had considered doing this before, but never had the guts. Suddenly she was curious to feel what the real thing might be like. She had thought for so long she wouldn't have a chance with anyone, so why bother getting her hopes up? But now?

It was bigger than she thought it would be. There was a suction cup attached to the base. She couldn't help but giggle as it wobbled around. The real things weren't like that were they? It was see through and scarlet colored. She found her mouth watering and swallowed down her drool. Maybe that's where she should start? With her mouth? It that something Cathy fantasized about?

It was so strange, thinking about Cathy like that. She didn't have a crush on her or anything, and she was pretty sure Cathy was strait as an arrow. But somehow she felt a strong urge to satisfy her. Not a sexual urge though. More of a duty. She wasn't sure how she felt about that. But still she continued to fulfill that duty. Did Cathy want her to go down on Todd? Is that something she thought about? Erin had known Todd for a while too. Was this something he wanted?

Cathy went to her shower stall and closed the glass door. She turned on the water. She took a few deep breaths in the warmth before kneeling down and securing the dildo to the glass door. Now that it was hanging just above her face it was even more imposing. She sighed and made sure it was all slick with water before putting the tip in her mouth. It didn't turn her on as much as she thought it would. It was really just awkward. She couldn't fit most of it in before it was uncomfortable. It didn't feel right. She only really knew about sex from biology text books. Maybe it would be different with a real one? Maybe Todd's was smaller? She tried another minute or two before abandoning it. The taste was plastic and the action was mundane and tiring on her neck.

Cathy probably used her breasts. Erin pinched her nipples and pulled anxiously. If she squeezed them together hard she had some cleavage, but not enough to fit a dick between. She could rub the sides if she really tried. She looked around for something else to lube the cock. There was some skin care lotion with coconut oil in it. It wouldn't be the first time she had used it for naughty reasons. She took some and applied it to the dildo. Some washed down to the floor and made the ground slick. She applied it to her chest as well and then tried to surround the cock on the wall, rising up on her knees and pressing against it hard enough to barely bring her tits in cold contact with the shower door. Her breastbone massaged the shaft, but her breasts had a hard time going round like they should. She gave up after the cock flopped out two or three times. The whole experience just made her feel pathetic and desperate.

She stood and gripped the door handle before turning and putting the dildo on her backside. She let it slip and slide and she bumped her butt lightly against the glass. She giggled. It was fun, and there was something naughty about the sensation, but there was no real stimulation. A little sexy though. She liked the feeling of squeezing around it. She gulped. She felt hotter now. The foreplay was over. It was time.

She had known Todd about as long as Cathy did. She had a small crush on him, sure, but never thought in a million years she'd have a chance, so she never let herself have any fantasy's either. Now? Erin remembered how strong he was. How confidant. How capable. She reached between her long legs and angled the cock to her womanhood. This was it. The experiment was about to commence. It was time to see what it felt like. She gripped the handle to the door tightly as the hot water relaxed her muscles. The floor below her was slippery so she tried going slow and steady. She pulled herself around it. She had to use one hand to keep it in as she relaxed and let it enter her. After the head, the rest was easy.

It felt so different from just her clit. It wasn't as intense, but she felt sexier. It felt tight. It felt right. She leaned forward until her face and chest touched the cold tile wall and her butt bumped the glass door. She accidentally let the door open when she bumped it. She pulled it back with her grip. A moan escaped her lips as the door fucked her. That felt good. That felt great. She did it again, letting the door bounce open off her butt after each pull. The door fucked her like a man would as she pulled it with an easy rhythm.

""Todd-"" She cried. Was she crying? She felt sad again. This wasn't going to happen. Todd didn't like her. He wasn't going to cheat on Cathy. Cathy had just been rambling and drunk. This whole thing was just her being weird and pathetic. What would they think if they knew she was being so perverted?

She remembered Cathy's words, ""I want to see Todd fuck your brains out!""

""Oh!"" She fucked herself faster, ""Fuck my brains out Todd!"" She cried. ""Fuck!"" The word was foreign on her lips. She wasn't this kind of girl. She didn't talk dirty. Guys didn't look at her that way. She didn't get dick. She didn't get fucked by hot guys. She was a brainy, smart, pure girl who never got a man, and never had kids. Her idea of a fun night out was curled up with a good book in a cold, empty bed.

She heard Cathy's voice, ""If you and Todd had kids, I'd love them too!""

""Ahh!"" She was so close to her peak. Her whole body felt hot and fiery. She was losing control she wasn't sure if she'd be able to stand when it hit her. The floor was slick, the walls were slick. There was a wave of burning desire coming strait at her. The glass fucked her hard and steady as she felt the peak slowly pull her in. She was tired already from leaning over for so long. ""Knock me up!"" She sobbed, just on the precipice. It was like a riptide taking the feet out from under her, ""Fuck!"" She felt the orgasm slam into her just as she lost traction. Her body folded in half as her tits slipped. She slowly fell as she came. ""Ahh!"" Her ass was up and her face was sliding down. She couldn't grab onto anything. Her body was shaking against the glass and she clenched tight against the cock. ""Ohh!"" She heard the cock pop off the glass as she fell further. The world went upside down and her legs left the ground as her weight rested on her shoulders. ""Shit!"" She cursed as the orgasm continued to crash into her. Her knees touched her ears and she reached up to hold the cock in place as she humped the sky and water. The shower pelted her pussy and clit and drove her wild, ""Oh!"" It felt so good it almost hurt. ""I love you Todd!"" She cried as her hips finally joined the rest of her on the ground in a puddle of slippery sex and pity. ""I love you Todd."" She panted again.

Then she realized what she was saying. ""Fuck!"" She shivered as the last waves of her pleasure subsided. ""Fuck, I love Todd too."" She said to herself aloud. ""Shit.""

--

As she suspected, Cathy remembered nothing of that night's confession. Erin was at a loss for what to do when Cathy invited her over for dinner one Friday evening. She came in a modest black dress and tried to act natural. ""Erin!"" Cathy hugged her with so much force she thought she might crack. ""It's so good to see you again! It's been like a whole week!""

""Yep!"" Erin patted her back as Cathy let go of the smaller girl. ""Maybe we can have fewer drinks this time."" Erin chuckled.

""Fine idea."" Todd revealed himself from the doorway. His square chin and wide smile was strong and stout. ""Spaghetti is about done! Only one glass of wine Cathy!""

""Jeeze, you're on his side?"" She playfully pushed Erin. ""Why don't you two get a room?""

""Haha."" Erin tried to sound sincere with her laughter. ""Right."" This was a bad idea, but there was no way out of it. The three sat at the dinner table.

""Where are the twins?""

""Asleep."" Cathy said, ""That means we probably have two or three hours at least. Think of what we could do!"" She nudged Erin and gave her a wink.

""Haha."" Erin filled her mouth with spaghetti.

""Is something wrong?"" Todd asked.

""Nope. Nothing at all."" Erin shook her head trying to find something to talk about. ""Um, so, how's work?""

""Terrible."" Todd shook his head, ""Can't find good skilled workers anywhere. I'm having to do most of it. I thought I'd get out of doing the stonework myself at this point in my life and stick to the business end.""

""Erin is almost a professor."" Cathy started. ""Maybe she can train some workers for you.""

""I am having a hard time holding onto engineers. Even the ones that stay can't even pronounce ""Pythagoras"", let alone tell an acute angle from an obtuse one.""

Erin giggled. Cathy played with her dress awkwardly and chuckled, pretending to understand. Erin knew the gesture well. Erin changed the subject.

""Well, I study botany."" Erin said. ""So, I wont be of too much help there.""

""Ah. Well, how are the plants doing then?"" Todd asked.

""Still growing."" Erin nodded. ""Still green.""

""Hah! you're a riot Erin."" Cathy smiled. ""And I really like your dress today. Where did you get it?""

""Oh, this? Just a thrift store thing.""

""And frugal. You know, I'd have never survived this long if not for her."" Cathy joked. ""I still can't believe you are single.""

""Yep. Just, you know, living the single life."" Erin said, trying not to look at Todd. She was about done with her plate.

""We should get together more often."" Cathy nodded to herself. ""This is really fun. Hey! We could even watch a movie! Come on! There's one of those new ones coming out this weekend."" She tried to convince both of them.

""I don't know. I have work-"" Cathy gave her a glare. ""But that's never stopped me before.""

She chuckled as Cathy smiled. ""I'll buy the tickets!!"" She hopped to her feet and gathered the plates.

--

Todd knew Cathy was a bit repressed. She had the catholic schoolgirl curse. She had lived a life with so many rules that now she always wanted to try new and wild things. But she always convinced herself she was a terrible person because afterward. She would still tell him about how guilty she felt about pre-marital sex. ""But you literally married me a month after I popped your cherry."" Todd would console her.

""But I lied to my parents!"" And that was that. She would eventually change her focus after a few days and be into some new and crazy thing, ""Let's make a sexy video tape! Then we can watch it together!"" and then a week later she'd have to burn every copy she could find to make sure no one found out about it. Every once in a while she'd remember some old sin and have to confess, ""You weren't the first guy I kissed! There was this one guy in ninth grade-"" And he'd roll his eyes and forgive her each time. He didn't even consider most of them bad, or abnormal. But it was never enough. ""I was really turned looking at another guy on TV the other day!"" She said in a panicked sob one night. ""I'm so sorry!""

He was used to it. He wouldn't have married her if it wasn't something he could handle. Out of all the eccentricities a woman could have, this was one of the more benign ones, and he even found it to be a bit cute. But he could recognize the pattern when Cathy asked him one night, ""Hey, I think it would be fun if we did a little bit of role-play!"" She seemed nervous. ""You know, like, say someone else's name during sex?""

""Sure. Can I be David Tennant?"" She gave him a scowl. ""See, it's funny, because last week you said you felt really guilty for being turned on by-"" Her scowl deepened. ""Alright, alright, what did you have in mind?""

She gave him a smile, ""Oh, I don't know, maybe, just, pretend I'm someone else?"" She blinked rapidly at him. ""If I could be anyone else for a night, who would you want me to be?""

Todd's spidey senses were activated.

""No one but you babe."" He said quickly.

""I mean, I know that."" She touched his chest and made circles around his pectorals, ""But maybe, if you could have someone different just once. Like, someone,"" She shrugged, ""Thinner? Maybe someone with darker hair?""

""What is this really about?"" Todd asked.

""I just want to give you some diversity."" She smiled, ""And I bought a wig. I bought a couple of wigs. I actually bought a lot of things on sale after Halloween.""

""Oh."" Todd tried to understand. ""So, like, I could fuck a wolf girl if I wanted. Or a slutty nurse."" He caressed her curves. ""You want to play dress up?""

Cathy made a look like he was getting closer. ""Maybe something more real. Like,"" She thought long and hard. ""Like, maybe I could put on a corset, and a wig, and you could call me Erin.""",,2025-08-15T18:46:18.681611,3705,
https://www.literotica.com/s/my-diary-entry-04-coming-home,My Diary: Entry 04 - Coming Home,Unknown Author,,,,,"Hi!

It's Emma.

If I thought I was embarrassed before, I don't even know what I was thinking, because I am now painfully aware what real embarrassment is. He has truly destroyed me this time. I can't go back from this...

What have I done?!

After everything that's been happening with Luke and I, and with Louisa, I was sure my relationship with him was over. Not wanting to be faced with that everyday in the flat, I decided to take it upon myself to move out, and give them the space to be a couple on their own. I thought that was very big and mature of me!

I obviously didn't have anywhere else to go, so I slinked back to live at home with my tail between my legs. Mom lives on her own since Dad passed, so, I thought I would be doing her a favour of giving her some company, and do chores for her, and nice stuff like that.

It wasn't long though until this mad episode with Luke caught up with me, and he came in with his charm and smiles, making me look like a fool. You see, I told Mom I was no longer with him, and he comes in saying I'm not in the best frame of mind, and I'm imagining it, and that he still wants me home; in our shitty little flat.

Mom ate it all up. She believed this wanker over her own daughter, which made me feel so genuinely upset and disheartened. I just went to my room for a bit to unpack my things, and cool off. I was not looking for a fight. I just wanted everything to be over, so I can move on with my life.

When I came out of my room, Luke was still there, chatting with Mom on the settee, sipping wine, and having a right old natter about me. I watched from the side, and listened. They didn't notice me, but I heard Luke complimenting Mom, and making a move on her. She was shy about it, but she didn't object, and she didn't refuse. I was appalled!

Still oblivious to my presence, Luke ushered Mom to her bedroom upstairs, and I followed, against my better judgment. I wanted to do or say something to interrupt and stop this, but I couldn't think of the right way to do it. They're consenting adults after all, and if this is what they want, we're having our troubles, but, it's still fucking weird. We're technically still engaged, right?!

As I peeked around the doorframe of Mom's room, I saw much more of her than I wanted, but I didn't shy away or turn back, and watched as my fiance went down on her as she lay back, going along with this. She rose up to take her blouse off, now naked as they've been shedding her clothes all through the house, and she noticed me silhouetted in the door, and recoiled, ""Oh, Emma! Have some decency, would you?""

Luke leered at me, making my blood run cold and hot all at once, scared and aroused by him. He sat up with Mom, and turned her head to his, indulging in a kiss, and while they did, his fingers crept down to tease her below, in plain view of me looking on.

I let my feelings get the better of me. With what I've been through recently, I didn't think anything of what I did, as I found myself at the foot of the bed where they sat, replacing Luke's fingers with mine. My heart was beating so fast and irregularly that it was like a jackhammer, and I almost sicked-up. My head felt faint, and I almost lost balance.

It was when Luke was fondling Mom's bare breasts, she realised something wasn't right, and turned to see me knuckles-deep in her. She gasped, ""Emma? What're you doing? How dare you? Stop that! Stop that, right now?""

I obeyed, and Luke looked darkly at me, daring me to go on, so I sat beside Mom, and I held her cheek as I dove in for a kiss. She pulled away, resisting, ""No! No, Emma, we are not doing this! What has gotten into you? I don't want to do this!""

I saw the shame and disappointment in her eyes, and I would've stopped, but Luke said to her, ""I told you. She's sick in the head. She doesn't stop until she gets what she wants. She loves you, as she loves me, in her way. I'm sorry you were caught up in this. I've tried to make her decent, and failed as her fiance.""

Mom asked Luke, ""Is this what you've been living with? Such vile behaviour! It's unbecoming. I'm disappointed.""

I had to speak up, raised voice from the hurt inside, ""That's a lie! It's not true, at all! He's manipulating you!""

Mom shouted at me, ""How dare you come in here like you have just now, and try to say Luke's in the wrong when he's been nothing but a gentleman! I want you out, Emma. You're not welcome here.""

I truly felt lost, and deeply upset, effectively homeless, and Luke knew it as I heard him shuffle over Mom to whisper in my ear, ""You stay a while, and join us, and you can come back with me. I don't want to see you out on the street now.""

I was trembling with fear, and saw fear in Mom's eyes. What do I do? What could I do? I've dug myself deep in shit, and I don't have anywhere else to go. Luke can completely fuck me by forcing my hand to do more things with her, then go back on his word, and I'd still be with nothing. Is he that mean? After all, what do I have to lose? I'm already out of Mom's house, so...

Mom just kept on saying, 'no,' as I leant over her, and kissed her, very slight at first, then getting myself into it, feeling her lips vibrate on mine as she continued to deny this. She begged Luke, ""Tell her. Do something, please?""

Luke rubbed my shoulders, pushing me closer, holding a deep massage around my neck muscles, and slowly pulled me away from Mom. He feigned concern, and told me, ""Sit in the corner there at the dresser, and watch us... if you have to,"" before replacing me to kiss Mom.

I could walk out right now, but I would be truly fucked, and without a home, so I did the only thing I could, and sat at the dresser on the stool, leaning on the wood with my arm as I watched my fiance with who I thought would be his future Mother-in-law, and I wondered how long he's wanted to do this with her?

Mom kept herself occupied with Luke, and seemed to pretend I wasn't there. Luke wasn't so concerned, obviously looking back at me, making sure I was taking everything in, just as Mom was taking everything in.

Luke said to me, ""You must be wanting to enjoy this; fully?""

I knew what he was hinting, and he knew I would have to play along, otherwise he would leave me out on the street with fuck all. I stripped down, and leant back on the stool, shoulders nestled against the wall, with my side on the dresser, and I rubbed myself. I was so hot from how wrong it all was, doing this to him doing my Mom, but I wasn't given a choice, right?

Luke said to Mom, ""Look at Emma. She has no shame doing that for you. She hardly ever did that for me. I deserve better than her, don't you think?""

Mom craned her head up to see me, and she winced, ""Emma! Why are you doing this? Why is this happening... I don't... I don't... No, Emma... Why?""

I was ready to burst into tears. Luke lifted Mom's leg, getting himself deeper inside her so I could see clearly, and he said softly, ""Tell her how much you like it, Emma,"" wickedly smiling like the Devil himself.

As the tears poured from my eyes, I cried, ""Oh... Oh, yes... Oh, fuck Mom good... That's it... That's what I like to see... Mom, I feel so good... Mom makes me feel so, so good... I love how Mom makes me feel... Fuck me...""

Luke loved hearing those words, and he lunged out of Mom's vagina, and leapt at her head to coat her face with his cum. He sat at her side, and offered to me, ""You should clean her up. It's the least you can do for your Mom, right?""

I hurried over and licked up Luke's ejaculate from Mom's face, whispering sincerely, ""I'm sorry.""

Mom looked to her side at Luke as I continued to clean her, and she turned back to me to whisper back, ""I'm sorry, Emma,"" squeezing my arms as pulling me closer for a brief hug before letting me go. She said to Luke, ""You two should get home, if that's what you're doing. I need a nightcap, and then bed. See yourselves out,"" nodding slightly at me with a fixed stare.

Luke grabbed my clothes, and frogmarched me from the bedroom, leading me from the house, and told me, ""You're such a bad girl. I can't believe you actually did that. You're not going anywhere; especially now you've burned this bridge.""

I couldn't argue with that.

I just got myself off to my Mom having sex!

What will Luke get me to do next?

https://www.literotica.com/s/scarlett-ch3-the-first-night,Scarlett ch3: the First Night,Unknown Author,,,,,"We walk down the long, silent corridor, your expensive shoes padding ahead and my bare feet following two steps behind, at the end of the silver chain. I keep my eyes down, following your tread, terrified that someone will emerge from one of the doors that line the corridor and see me. I imagine eyes behind the peepholes in the doors, staring at me, raking up and down my naked body, sneering or laughing at me as I meekly follow my master into whatever perversions he has in store.

We arrive at a door. You click your keycard against the pad and the light goes green. We walk into a beautiful suite, overlooking the city. Lights sparkle in the darkness beyond the window. An enormous bed sits on one side of the room, plush with expensive linen. There are couches and comfortable chairs, fresh flowers in a vase, a fruit bowl laden with fresh produce. I take in the luxury with wide eyes, but snap my gaze to your face as you turn to me.

""You have a long night ahead of you Scarlett. I am going to uncuff you for a moment so you can use the bathroom. Take a shower. Make sure you are clean and ready for me. Clean your juices off yourself but don't you dare rub that hungry cunt. It's mine now. Do you understand?""

I nod meekly.

""Do. You. Understand?"" you repeat, stepping towards me, one hand raised.

""Y-yes, Sir,"" I gasp. The hand stays raised for a moment, then sinks back to your side.

""You will learn, Scarlett,"" you say, almost to yourself. ""You will learn."" Then you reach around and uncuff me, guiding me to the bathroom.

It is every bit as luxurious as the rest of the suite. I quickly use the toilet, then get into the shower. I wash the urine off my body, the slick pussy juices off my thighs. I dry myself, then clean my teeth thoroughly: maybe you will kiss me? I want to taste fresh for you. There is body lotion and some makeup products laid out, and I take the hint, rubbing the deliciously scented lotion into my skin before applying mascara and eyeliner. I inspect myself in the mirror. The rigorous diet and exercise routine you have set for me has paid off; I am lean and toned, my muscles defined and shapely. All body hair has been removed. I can feel my heart beating with expectation and sexual tension. I am longing to be fucked, to be used for your pleasure, to feel you inside me, pushing into my very core. Every moment for months has been leading up to this. The need is all-consuming. I take a deep breath, and step back into the room.

It's as well I've taken that breath, because my ability to respire is suspended when I cross the threshold. The room is lit with candles, and you are standing in front of the bed. You are completely naked, your hand slowly moving up and down your erection. The candlelight glistens on your tanned skin, and your cock is absolutely magnificent, standing out proudly from your body. My mouth drops open, and I feel saliva spring from beneath my tongue; this moistening is mirrored between my legs as I imagine your magnificent member pushing into the folds of my flesh, parting my pussy lips and impaling me...

""Kneel,"" you command, pointing to where you have laid out a folded towel. I scurry forward and sink to my knees, my eyes never leaving your magnificent manhood. ""Good girl,"" you say. I tear my eyes away and upwards, looking at your face for a hint of what might happen next. ""Now Scarlett, you do not move from your position until instructed. Do you hear me? Remain kneeling. Do you understand?"" I nod, silently. You respond with your own nod of acknowledgement. ""Good. Hands behind your back.""

I obey, and you slip the cuffs back into place, securing my hands at the base of my spine. I then feel you slip a blindfold over my eyes, tightening it in place, so I cannot see anything around me. I listen intently, sensing the room around me, feeling you moving, circling me to my left. Then I feel your hand on top of my head, tilting it back. Instinctively, I open my mouth, sticking my tongue out just beyond my lower lip, making a smooth entryway, and I get my reward. I feel the head of your cock rest gently on my tongue and slip into my mouth, and I groan in pleasure. Oh, at last! What I've been longing for!

I bob my head back and forth, flickering my tongue along your length, puckering my lips up and down the shaft, trying my hardest to give you the best blowjob you've ever had. I'm gratified to hear your exhalation as you sink deep into my mouth, probing the back of my throat; it's all the encouragement I need. Your cock is thick, thicker than the dildo I've been practising on, and I have to stretch my mouth around it, but I think I can manage. I pull back, feeling your hand resisting me slightly, and take a breath, then go for it. I push until I feel your cock against the back of my throat and make a swallowing motion, clenching my thumbs in my fists to help overpower my gag reflex, and I feel your hardness push past the resistance and into my throat. You gasp...you actually gasp in pleasure! A sound I have longed to hear! as I feel your entire length disappear, and my lips nestle against your body. I push my tongue out and try to reach your balls, but the thickness of your cock is more than I'm used to and I gag, my throat constricting around your length. I try to pull back, but your hand is in my hair, pulling me onto your cock, holding me down. I gag again, my whole body convulsing this time, my arms tugging against the handcuffs as I struggle for air, tears springing through my closed eyelids into the blindfold. You release me a little and I gasp a breath down, but then you shove back in, and begin to facefuck me, hard. I am completely powerless to resist, a slave to your pleasure, as you take handfuls of my hair and ram my throat with your cock, again, again, again. I feel strings of drool run down my chin, splattering onto my chest, but all I can focus on is keeping my throat open, trying not to resist, as it will only make it worse, and breathing whenever I can.

You are silent and merciless, your thick manhood sliding in and out of my mouth, in and out of my throat. Occasionally you will withdraw completely and I will take shuddering gasps of breath, until you yank my hair back and I open wide again, ready to receive you. I wonder if you will facefuck me until you cum, or whether you plan to use my cunt, my ass...oh God, I hope you do! It's been so long, I'm sure that just one thrust of that magnificent cock would trigger the orgasm I so desperately crave...

But, just as I'm having that thought, there is a knock at the door. Your cock disappears from my mouth. I hear you padding across the suite towards the entrance, and take the opportunity to spit a glob of spit from my throat; I feel it land on my knees and dribble down to the towel beneath. I breathe deeply, readying myself for your return. But then, I freeze. I hear you coming back...but you are not alone. Someone else is with you. I hear a woman's voice.

""Oh, wow,"" it says. ""What a slut! Look at that..."" and she giggles. I recognise that laugh. Hayley. The waitress from downstairs. What the fuck is happening?

""I know,"" I hear you say. ""She's warmed me up nicely."" There's a pause. I can hear noises. Rustling. The sound of friction. A soft, gentle moan. And then, the unmistakable sound of kissing, tongues intertwining, lips moving against one another. You are kissing her. She is kissing you. What the fuck is this? I move my head, trying to find a gap in the blindfold, trying to catch a glimpse of what is happening...but it's hopeless. So I listen.

Hayley moans, and I hear the sound of fabric falling to the floor. Undressing. Then a giggle, and the soft creak of the bed. Have you picked her up, and laid her down? I hear more creaks as the mattress shifts...you have joined her. And then, the same sigh in your voice and the unmistakable slurping sounds of a blowjob, as Hayley wraps her lips around your cock.

""NO!"" I scream...but thankfully just in my head. I long to leap up, to jump up there, to push her off you, to take you for myself...but my hands are bound and, more than that, your instruction restrains me. ""Now Scarlett, you do not move from your position until instructed. Do you hear me? Remain kneeling. Do you understand?"" I realise that this is part of my training. Part of my induction. And it is torture.

""Oh, your cock tastes soooo good,"" moans Hayley, like some pornstar. ""But I want it inside me. Please, fuck me hard. Make me feel it...make me cum...""

There is a thud as I imagine you throwing her down on the bed, parting her legs, positioning yourself and waiting, hesitating, pausing. Are you both looking at me? Humiliating me? I long to move, but I can't; I'm transfixed, pinned to the spot. And then the sound that I've been dreading and longing for: Hayley's long, shuddering groan as you impale her on the full length of your cock. Oh God! I wish it was me! I want it! I need it! Oh fuck, this is horrible...

I don't know how long it goes on for. I hear your bodies rubbing and slapping together, punctuated by Hayley's moans, groans and running commentary, which is clearly intended to humiliate me further. ""Oh yeah! Oh fuck! You feel so good! Oh yes! There...just there! Oh god...just like that...oh yeah!"" You don't say a word, but I hear your breathing, like an elite athlete, in complete control, fucking her and torturing me at the same time.

You shift positions, again and again...I know because Hayley tells me so. ""Oh yeah, bend me over, take me from behind...oh yeah...so deep...oh yeah... fuck me hard..."" and ""mmm, let me ride you, big guy, yeah, just like that...mmm...feel my tits bounce as I ride you...oh, it feels so good...""

The images play out on my closed eyelids, behind the blindfold. Tears run down my cheeks; tears of frustration, of hurt, of jealousy. They are matched by the juices leaking from my aching pussy, teased in the elevator and then readied for sex by your aggressive facefucking, but now denied again. I can feel my whole uterus contracting, my empty pussy desperate to be filled with cock, my body demanding to be filled with male seed, an animal, natural impulse...I'm like a bitch on heat, but chained and caged and denied the release of mating. But I stay kneeling, listening to you fucking, living it out in my imagination, because I am yours, you can do as you please with me...and you have chosen this.

Eventually, of course, it reaches a climax. Hayley's words disintegrate into loud, staccato yelps and moans, punctuating your thrusts, until she screams ""I'm cumming!"" and I hear her breath stop, followed by a loud ""Oh fuckkkk...."" and moan after moan as a long, drawn-out orgasm rips through her ravaged body. From you, I hear a slight, strangled grunt and I know that your precious load, that treasure trove of your seed, is being pumped inside some waitress instead of me. I kneel, ignored, a silent blind witness to your climax.

There's more kissing. A few congratulations and thanks in Hayley's voice, hoarser now after all her moaning and screaming: ""that was amazing...fuck, you were so good...I haven't cum like that is a long time..."" You mutter and whisper in her ear. I strain, but I can't catch your words. Hayley giggles though, and I'm sure you're both looking at me. I remain impassive, kneeling, silent, though inside I am burning up with shame and humiliation. And then she's dressing. I hear her pulling her clothes on. Yes, there's no mistake, she's preparing to leave. More kisses. More whispers from you. ""Any time, big guy. Any time,"" she says. And the door opens, and closes, and we are alone again.",,2025-08-15T18:46:56.801061,2132,
https://www.literotica.com/s/wife-shares-me,Wife Shares Me,Unknown Author,,,,,"A short little 750 word vignette from a time with my second wife.

I met my second wife soon after I got transferred to Camp Lejeune. I went to town and tried to find a bar as far from the front gate as possible. I found one, walked in, and this big tall redhead was tending bar. I was immediately enamored and introduced myself as Don and she said her name was Sue. Immediately several of the old timers said, ""no, her name is Rolling Stone.""

She blushed, and I said ""I don't understand"".

""Have you ever heard the phrase ""A rolling Stone gathers no moss""?"" one of the old guys said. ""She is a redhead, and her pubic hair is almost non-existent. (Back then waxing wasn't a thing) She used to ""roll around"" quite a bit and that's how she got the name."" I cracked up and she just blushed even more.

I became a regular at the bar and soon found out that she was no longer playing around but that two of the older guys were fuckbuddies. I started dating her, obviously non-exclusively, and when I was on duty or on a field exercise, she was safe and taken care of (and probably fucked), because those old guys actually cared for her.

When I actually married her, they both walked her down the aisle and gave her away. It was a sweet and loving gesture, appreciated by those who knew the backstory. I knew that I was due to deploy overseas in a year or so, and knew that she would be loved, cared for and kept safe and satisfied while I was gone, knowing she wouldn't be fucking around or looking for strange. And that is exactly how it happened, but that is a story for another day. There was none of that stupid jealousy and fragile ego bullshit that so many men get hung up on. Anyway, that is the background on my wife and relationship.

I know she bragged about me to her girlfriends, because I overheard several of the conversations.

One Saturday night, after closing the bar, she crawled into bed, obviously wound up, and proceeded to wear me out. Sunday morning started the same with her swallowing my morning

load and then snuggling. I grinned and said to her, ""what has gotten you so fired up?""

She said, ""I have next Friday night off, and I am having a divorce party for Joanne (one of her friends), and will probably have eight to ten women here. I would like you to be the stripper."" I have bragged about you and I guarantee you will enjoy it. For reference, I am only slightly above average (a little under seven inches and average thickness), but know what to do with it. I've told the girls that you are free to play with and enjoy. This is your night.

Friday night arrived, and so did the women. Some didn't know that I was going to be the stripper, so there was some surprise, but no complaints. Most were wives and girlfriends of guys I knew.

I came out in a thong and started working it with Joanne, the recent divorcee. She grabbed my ass with both hands and nuzzled my balls and cock with her mouth. She soon had my thong off and my cock in her mouth.

My wife interceded and told her she would have another shot at me later, and to let the other girls have their fun. As I went from table to table, I was fondled, ass grabbed, butthole penetrated, sucked and otherwise objectified, and finally got to the last table. The Captain's wife (my Company Commander, I was still a Second Lieutenant) sucked me in, deep throated me, penetrated my ass with a finger, and then drained my balls, to the cheers of all the other ladies there. She pulled me down into a passionate kiss, sharing my cum with me, and said thank you. I said, the thanks is all mine. I don't know if she had anything to do with it, but I got stellar reviews, was soon promoted to First Lieutenant and made XO of the Company.

The girls all finally left and Joanne, my wife and I were all that were left. Sue said, ""Joanne, he is all yours for the night. You need to be reminded how to get back in the saddle.""

The next morning, wifey stuck her head in and said, ""slut, what are you doing to my husband. Just draining his balls, Joanne said. Sue just said, breakfast in 10, so you better hurry.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

It had been a very full weekend at the campground. Of course, I was part of that full set of campers, along with my wife. But the weekend was gone, as were most of the campers, and my wife. I was still there with my huge 32 footer, but alone now. More alone than just my wife having gone home for the week, while I stayed to scout some new fishing holes on the lake, but alone as one of the very few campers still in this section of the state park. Further on down the point, sticking out into the lake, there were several camp sites filled with an assortment of tent and trailer campers. Down where I was, nearer the bathrooms and shower buildings, but a bit further from the water, there were quite a few less campers. There was me, there was one other trailer that looked like it was actually just sitting unused at the moment, and there was the trailer right across the road, in the campsite that I had to walk past to get down to the water and my boat.

But, it was still Sunday. The weekend hadn't run it's course yet, and the campground was still full. I'd kind of kept an eye on a camper across the road all weekend, as well as the two women that were using it, partly because one of the women was

very

good looking, walking around in a tiny bikini almost the whole time, and partly because I was just plain curious. Not necessarily curious about the two women, but about how they managed to use the micro camper they were pulling behind their small car. The camper was shaped like half a teardrop, flat bottom, rounded and curved front and top, and the back sloped almost to a point. It was only a little over 5 feet tall, which meant just over t four feet of inside height at the tallest point, the whole thing not much more than eight or nine feet long. It looked to me like you would have to step outside to change your mind, let alone your clothes, at least compared to my huge, camper, capable of sleeping ten, complete with all the amenities of home, even a small bathtub.

Over the course of the weekend, I watched with curiosity, trying to figure out what the camper got them, besides a place to sleep that wasn't a tent. There was a small kitchen that slid out the side, giving them a tiny sink and small, two-burner stove. The sloped back of the unit lifted up like a clam shell, exposing a small storage area that held their cooking gear and a tiny refrigerator that looked like it wasn't much larger than a plastic milk crate. I had lunch boxes that were nearly as big as their refrigerator. What the unit did have, that made it better than a tent, was an air conditioner. Though the only way it seemed possible to enjoy it was to be lying in the bed that had to be almost the length of the camper.

The girls had set up a small, square, pop-up canopy, giving them shade, and this seemed to be where they spent most of the time they weren't lounging in the warm lake water. I had air conditioning, but I enjoyed sitting out in the breeze when I wasn't out on the boat or also lounging in the warm lake water, at least until it got into the mid and upper nineties.

Over my nearly forty years of marriage, my wife and I have had our issues, but we'd always managed to work them out. One issue was that she was rather possessive of me. She knew she had a good thing and she seemed to be afraid that someone might steal me away. Not that she had anything to worry about. I loved her and I wasn't about to change partners, especially at this late age. But just to keep her from worrying, I had always worked to keep my ogling of good-looking women as unobtrusive as I could. I didn't want her thinking I was imagining undressing some sexy looking woman, even though in some cases that's exactly what I was doing. She knew I looked and never complained, unless I was obvious about it.

It was this possessiveness, that made it surprising to me, that on Sunday morning, as we headed back up from the boat after fishing, she stopped to chat with the two much younger women in that site we'd walked past so many times already. She spent a long time chatting, at least it felt like a long time. I had time to go into the camper, change into my shorts, and get a drink before she finally wandered back to our site. She came back to the camper, changed into her own shorts, got a drink and settled into a camp chair next to me.

""You know, they seem pretty nice."" She said before she took a long drink from her insulated cup.

""I suppose."" I answered. ""Haven't really done much more than say hi on the way by.""

""Well, you know, it's gonna be a long week. If you wanted to you could always take them out fishing. You know how much I hate having you out on the boat alone. Just in case you fall overboard or something crazy like that.""

You could have knocked me over with a wrecking ball, or even a feather. Not in a hundred years would I have ever suggested such a thing, taking strange women out on the boat without her along? That just seemed like an invitation for trouble. So, in total dismay, I just shook my head and said I didn't think that'd be a good idea, leaned over and gave her a kiss and tried to let the whole idea go.

That afternoon I took her out to go swimming and she again surprised me. In the last dozen or so years, she'd become more and more reluctant to do anything outside the bedroom. Groping her in the water was not her idea of a good time any longer, so I was quite surprised when she pulled the top of her swim suit down to her waist while we getting ready to get into the water, asking me to put sunblock on her. There were other boats around, but none close, so I didn't hesitate to spend a few short minutes coating her upper body, including her soft boobs, with cream. I even pushed the suit down further, without the expected complaint, to rub on her butt for a few moments. I thought maybe I'd even get to go further, until another boat approached the cove we were anchored in which ended our little play session. While we were swimming, she did on two occasions pull her top down and flash me her tits, but only when we were on the shore side of our big pontoon boat so no one else could see her. The second time she did it, she left her boobs exposed while she paddled her float closer to me and undid the tie of my swim suit. In a few awkward moments she had the string loose and was trying to work my suit down over my butt as I sat in the mesh web of the float I was in. I was wondering what she was up to, but wasn't about to stop her, and helped her work it down over my butt. She didn't stop there though, pulling the suit all the way down my legs, leaving me sitting in the float completely naked. She grinned a somewhat devious little grin that I only saw when she knew she was doing something I wasn't expecting from her, and tossed my suit up onto the boat. She paddled closer to me and wrapped her legs around me, pulling us together until we were floating my dick pressed to her crotch.

Had the water been a bit shallower, I might have been able to get my dick into her, but the floats we were using just weren't going to allow that without dunking both of us, so she settled for jacking me off under the water, giggling like a little girl as she watched me come, my dick pumping out streamers of white cum under water, that floated between us until she pushed them away.

We swam a bit more, with her keeping her legs around mine, pulling us both around the back of the boat with her paddling, leaving me floating with only the extremely clear water to cover the fact that I was naked. A number of boats had arrived as we were swimming, the cove suddenly becoming a lot more popular than I was used to. Since I was suitless, I asked her to climb into the boat and toss down my suit, which she agreed to do. She did climb up into the boat, but instead of tossing my suit down to me, she just stood there, grinning at my predicament.

""You're always the one that wants to go skinny dipping!"" She said loudly enough that the closest boats would have had no problems hearing her. I frowned, wondering what she was thinking. I couldn't just expose myself to random people. There could be children around. Almost as if reading my mind, she leaned over the ladder and said much more quietly. ""Don't worry. You'll only be showing off for a few women."" I shook my head and climbed out of the water and grabbing a towel as quickly as I could to cover myself, but not without being seen my at least half a dozen women on the next boat over, much to my wife's apparent pleasure at my discomfort. Just like talking to the ladies across the road, I didn't know what the heck she was thinking, but then there were times when I had no clue what went through her mind. Men aren't supposed to understand women I guess.

That night, after evening fishing and dinner, my wife took off for home, leaving me sitting in front of the fire, wondering if that morning had been a serious suggestion or a joke. I was also still perplexed about our afternoon swim. She had always been very resistant to doing anything out where anyone had an even remote possibility of seeing her partly dressed. Then she went and did that, apparently intentionally displaying my hardware to the women in that other boat. It seemed to be more than a little out normal for her, yet she clearly found my discomfort almost humorous. Or was it something else? Not my discomfort, but the hardon that I couldn't quite seem to keep hidden as I climbed back into the boat? Or maybe the fact that I had a hardon at all? I was left to ponder all this as I stared at the cracking fire.

---o---

It was Monday morning and I was headed out to fish early, hitting the water about six-thirty. The girls across the way weren't up yet when I walked past their site, and I couldn't resist chuckling to myself at the thought that the bedroom in my camper was almost bigger than their whole camper. I fished for several hours on my family sized 24' pontoon boat until the sun started baking me, even under the large bimini-style shade cover the boat had. Since there were practically no boats on the lake, being early enough that most of the tubers and skiers weren't out yet, and the fact that it was a weekday, with its significantly lower traffic, I decided to just find a nice quiet little cove for a swim. I headed to the usually quiet little cove that my wife and I had swum in the day before.

When my wife and I were first married, all we had was a little fourteen foot row boat with a five horse motor. And if we got hot, we'd find a nice, quiet place like the cove I was now pulled into, strip off our clothes and take advantage of the lake. After several kids and progressing to, our now, near retirement age, my wife had become much more reserved and more concerned with her body image; as a result, it would be a pretty hard sell to get her to do what I was now doing: stripping down to get into the water butt naked. The way I figured it, if someone did come, what was the worst that would happen? They'd get a free look at my dick when I climbed back into the boat like yesterday?

I floated in the water, cooling off for about twenty minutes before I decided I needed to get some sunblock on my private parts. I was still the only boat back in the cove I was in, so I climbed out, toweled off and then used some spf-50 sunblock on my snow white, never exposed to the sun parts. In the years before my wife got shy about this kind of thing, we would have spent some time making sure each other was thoroughly covered with sunblock, but that kind of thing wouldn't be happening any time soon. Having her let me do her boobs the day before was as far as she'd gone in many years. I spent several minutes making sure everything that could burn was covered. I even made sure to amply stroke my member to get it hard and work the lotion in real good. I didn't want to get burned down there if I happened to get a hard-on while floating in the lake. At least, that was the excuse I told myself as I thought about rubbing sunblock on my wifes boobs the say before, and even stripping her one piece suit all the way off her while she stroked my hardon. It wasn't a surprise when my fat hardon erupted, spewing my load all over the deck as I stood there trembling and panting.

Feeling relieved, I slipped back into the water for another half hour or so, finally calling it quits when I got hungry. I dried off again, dressed and headed in for lunch, no other boats having ever come into the cove, unlike Sunday.

""Hey Allen! Fishing alone this morning?"" the good looking thirty-something year old gal in her little yellow bikini, Abby, I think I'd heard her friend call her, called to me as I walked up the grassy hill toward their camp site from where I anchored the boat along the shoreline.

""Yeah. Wife went home last night for the week. It's just me out here baching it now,"" I answered as I trudged up the hill along the edge of their campsite.

""All alone? What? Did she get tired of you that soon?""

I paused next to their site and laughed. ""No. I have a lot more vacation time than she does. No, I'm spending the whole week just checking out some new fishing holes I want to try. She'll be back next weekend. Well, she has to be, I can't pull the boat and the camper at the same time.""

""Oh. I see. So you need her to get home, then! I see how it is,"" she said with a grin that said she was joking.

""Yeah, well, not all of us have a camper you can almost stuff into the back of a pickup,"" I joked back.

""Oh there are a lot of those. They call 'em tents, I think.""

That made me laugh. ""Yeah. I suppose so.""

""Isn't it hard to pull something that big?"" Toto, pronounced like the sound a train whistle makes, the slightly heavier set young Chinese woman asked from where she sat in her lawn chair, her body covered by a more conservative two piece suit that didn't show nearly as much as Abby's bikini.

""Don't know that it's hard, but it's expensive, and slower. I can run at seventy or seventy-five if I want to drink premium gas at five miles to the gallon. If I slow it down a bit, I can get almost ten or eleven to the gallon.""

Abby laughed. ""Damn. And I thought me getting eighteen was bad!""

""My truck barely gets that without the trailer!""

""Oh well. That's what happens when you have big stuff,"" Abby said.

""Well, you know what they say: size matters,"" I teased with a smile as I turned to continue toward my trailer.

""Oh, I don't know. Size is nice, but ya gotta know what to do with it. Do you?""

""I must!"" I called over my shoulder. ""I have four kids.""

""Doesn't mean you're good with it, just lucky four times!"" she called after me as I crossed the road.

I paused on the other side and looked back. She sat with a grin on her face before sticking her tongue out at me for a moment. I shook my head, deciding I'd better not say what I was thinking, and headed to the trailer for some lunch.

---o---

The afternoon was getting hot. From where I sat reading on my kindle, I could see the girls had headed down to the lake to cool off, and I was thinking the same thing. It only took me a very few minutes to change into my swim trunks and water shoes. I hiked down to the water and stopped on my boat to spray on some sunblock, rubbing it into my arms, chest, shoulders and face. I grabbed one of my floats that was made from a swim noodle with a mesh seat slung under it. I flipped down the swim ladder and climbed into the water leaning back in the float to relax in the bathwater warm lake.

""We figured you'd go back out fishing,"" I heard Toto say as I floated in the slightly wavy lake.

I looked around to find her and then answered. ""Not now. Too hot for the fish, and me. I will again in the evening when the sun starts to get lower.""

""I don't know how you do it, sitting out in the sun, fishing for hours. Don't you get hot?""

""Sure. But all I have to do is get wet and problem solved.""

""Get hot this morning?"" Abby asked.

""No more than normal.""

""I didn't see you walking back up the hill with a swim suit and, well, you're wearing it now, so that begs the question: what did you wear this morning?""

I looked at the naughty little grin on her face and decided to have some fun. ""Well, if you promise not to tell anyone. I just take off all my clothes and get in naked.""

She smirked at me. ""I saw your wife down here swimming. One piece suit, t-shirt and shorts over it. I'm sure she just strips down and climbs right in with you, right?""

""Who said I did it with her?"" I grinned back.

""Ohhhhh! Naughty boy!"" She giggled. ""Somehow I didn't take you for one of those.""

""One of those?""

""You know, naughty boys that do things when their wives aren't around?""

""Well, things is a relative term. Taking a swim naked is pretty tame. I don't think she'd exactly divorce me for something like that.""

Abby paddled closer on the floating foam pad she was lying on, working herself toward me with her feet pointed toward me. She spread her legs a bit and pushed her float closer to me until she could hook her heels onto the noodle that wrapped around behind me and holding me up in the water. She pulled us closer, her knees bending and her legs spreading until I was looking right at her crotch, the yellow material not covering nearly as much from this viewpoint as when she'd been standing. ""Really? Now, just exactly what kind of thing don't you consider tame?""

""I would consider this not exactly tame,"" I answered, trying not to stare at her crotch, but having a hard time not doing so. I was also not being very successful at keeping my dick from getting hard as a rock in my swim suit.

""Why? What isn't tame? We're just lying here talking, not even naked. Now, if we were naked, well

that

might not be so tame, but right now we're just talking, right?"" she asked quietly, bending her legs a little more to pull her crotch closer to my face.

I could feel the end of the float pad she was lying on start to rest on my chest, her crotch only two feet or so from my face. I was half tempted to reach out and pull the bikini bottom aside. I was telling myself that it was the ultimate tease, but that was just an excuse to do something I knew was wrong. It didn't matter how much she teased me, it was a line I didn't need to be crossing. I reached for her feet, lifted them off my noodle and gently pushed her back. Her float glided away from me. ""You really should be careful who you tease. Not everyone is as much of a gentleman as I am.""

She hung her legs over the sides of the float pad and looked down her body at me. ""Who said I wanted you to act like a gentleman?""

I opened my mouth to say something and then closed it. There was nothing I could say that wouldn't get me in trouble. I paddled over to the boat, climbed up the stern ladder and headed back to the campsite, doing the best I could to hide the raging hard-on that was obscenely poking out my sopping wet swim suit.

---o---

I stayed in the air conditioning the rest of the afternoon, coming out when it was time to grill dinner. By six thirty I'd cooked, eaten, and cleaned up, so I was headed back down to the boat for evening fishing.

""You going out again?"" Abby called from where she was once again, or still, sitting under the shade canopy they had erected.

""Yep. Gotta try a new spot and see if it's any good,"" I answered as I walked past their site.

""So, how do you do that?""

""I just fish it a few ways and see what I see on the depth finder,"" I answered as she got out of her chair and started walking to intercept me.

""So, I'm kinda bored. Would you mind a little company?"" she asked hopefully.

I stopped walking and turned to look at her. ""You want to come out fishing with me?""

""Well, just for the boat ride. I don't need to fish or anything. I mean, I can only swim and hang out here so much. I just thought if you didn't mind, I'd just ride along. But if you don't want to, I mean it's your quiet time or something,"" she said, the look on her face almost that of a shy little girl instead of the well-endowed thirty something she was.",,2025-08-15T18:47:03.193664,773,2.0

End of Authors note.

Jane wakes up around 2 am, and hears a strange whimpering noise, one that almost sounds like crying. She gets out of bed, and listens, remembering that Amber is on the floor, and that the noises are coming from her. Kneeling down next to her, she gently cups her face, noticing she is curled into a ball.

""What's wrong?"" Jane whispers, leaning in.

Amber doesn't really answer, just pulling herself into a more compact shape, but not pulling away from Jane's hand. ""Amber, honey, please tell me what's wrong."" Jane says.

""I don't know, Mistress."" Jane hears her say faintly, through sobs. Jane feels Robert approach, having been woken up by her rolling out of bed.

""Can you help me get her into bed with us?"" Jane asks him.

""Of course, honey."" Robert says. ""Amber, are you ok with me picking you up? No one is going to hurt you, we are just going to move you to the bed.""

Robert can barely see Amber nod, and he reaches underneath her, picking her up carefully, and then hugging her to his chest as he rises. ""If she wasn't so skinny, I'm not sure I could do this. I'm not getting any younger, and my back isn't getting any better.""

Robert gets her to the bed, and lays her as close to the middle as he can, Jane already getting in on the other side.

""Amber, would you prefer to cuddle with Robert or me?"" Jane asks. ""Or both?""

Amber doesn't answer, but does scoot closer to Jane, who moves closer to put her arms around her, stroking her back gently as she holds her. Amber squirms her head deeper into Jane's cleavage, as if she is trying to hide. ""You are safe now."" Jane says softly, gently stroking the back of her head. ""Everything is going to be ok.""

Robert watches, trying to figure out how to help, before accepting that he can't, and laying down towards the far edge of the bed, giving Amber space. As her sobs fade, she says something to Jane that he can't quite hear.

""Robert, can you scoot a bit closer?"" Jane says. ""She needs both of us.""

Robert slides over slowly, careful not to scare her, until he is close enough to put one hand on her arm, stroking it gently. Amber slides her legs backward a bit, letting her feet make contact with his, and he shuffles a bit closer, until he is lying against her back.

""Is this what you need?"" he asks soothingly, and she just nods. Robert moves his arm past her arm for a moment to touch Jane, and he makes eye contact with her. She just nods, and they continue to cuddle her until she appears to be asleep.

""Let's try to stay like this as long as we can."" Jane whispers over Amber's head to Robert. ""She needs the rest badly.""

Robert just nods, and Jane sees a tear go down his cheek. She moves her hand to hold his, on top of Amber, and the trio drift back off to sleep.

The next morning Robert wakes up, feeling his watch alarm go off. He quickly but smoothly moves it away from Amber, and works his other arm free, managing to turn off the alarm without appearing to wake her. Slipping out of bed he grabs his clothes, and decides to head to the guest shower instead of the master, to not wake up Amber or Jane.

Opening the door to the hallway, he nearly bumps into Alexia and Lucia, who are waiting at the top of the stairs. Lucia looks like she wants to say something, but Robert puts his finger over his lips, and points down the hall. The girls head that way, and Robert follows to their room, closing the door behind him.

""Is everything ok?"" Lucia asks once the door shuts. ""We've been a little worried.""

""Everything is fine."" Robert says reassuringly, hugging one of them with each arm. ""Jane found Amber crying during the night, but we managed to calm her down. Cuddles helped a lot.""

""She got to cuddle with you both?"" Alexia asks jealously. ""Mistress Jane doesn't usually do cuddles like you do.""

""If you are ever in as bad of shape as Amber is, and needed that, I'm sure she would."" Robert says. ""Let's try to keep things down this morning, and let them sleep as late as we can. Alexia, maybe you can hang out up here quietly after breakfast and listen for them to wake up?""

""Yes, Master."" Alexia says. ""Lucia, I'll text you when I hear them moving so you can start pancakes for the Mistress.""

""Thank you both. I think they both need to be pampered a bit today."" Robert says. ""If either of you need anything, just text or come into my office. I'll keep my camera off if I have any meetings.""

""May I bathe you now, Master?"" Alexia asks, flirting a bit.

""You can join me in the shower, but just for washing today."" Robert says. ""Remember we are keeping the noise down.""

""I'll go start your breakfast, sir."" Lucia says, giving him a brief kiss before walking out.

""Any idea where the sir came from?"" Robert asks Alexia a moment later.

""I think seeing you both take care of someone else is making us both appreciate you even more."" Alexia says, giving him a kiss on the cheek. ""Now, may this girl wash her master?"" Alexia adds, trying to keep a straight face before giggling.

""Only if you promise to never, ever do the third person thing again."" Robert says, not finding it that funny.

""Oh, fine..."" Alexia says. ""I'll try not to, very often.""

Robert sighs and just walks to the shower, knowing he isn't going to win this one. After a quick shower, they are both clean.

""I need to check on work, and then I'll be down to eat."" Robert says.

A few minutes later he does make it to the kitchen, and the three sit down to eat. As they enjoy breakfast, Robert says. ""We need to figure out logistics for this weekend. Worst case, I think we could end up with 8 new concubines, including Amber of course, and that is going to cause some immediate problems. Can you both start thinking of what those problems are going to be, and what we can do to minimize them?""

""Sleeping arrangements are the first thing I can think of."" Alexia says. ""I'll have the second set of bunk beds built today or tomorrow, but we may need to order more, and rearrange things a bit to fit them.""

""I suspect Amber will want to stay close to either Jane or I for a bit, and I'm assuming you two don't mind sharing with one of us?"" Robert asks.

""Of course not."" Lucia says. ""We will do what we need to do, and sleeping next to you is always a treat.""

""So worst case, we are looking at 12 people. We could do 4 in our bed, 3 in yours, 4 in the bunk beds, and 1 either on the floor, the couch, or an air mattress maybe."" Robert says. ""3 in your bed would be a bit tight though.""

""3 of me would fit ok."" Lucia says. ""But if they are normal sized, they'd be on top of each other.""

""What about your futon?"" Alexia asks. ""The one in your office.""

""I don't dislike any of you enough to ask you to even sit on that thing for more than a few minutes."" Robert says. ""It's hard as a brick. I'd rather sleep on the floor personally. If we ordered another set of bunk beds, where could we put them?""

""We could ditch the futon and put them in your office, but everyone in your work would see them when you turned on your camera during meetings."" Alexia says. ""I could try to re-arrange the existing bunk beds to fit a third in that room, I'd need to measure to see how that would work out.""

""I'll leave you to tackle that."" Robert says. ""I'm probably going to take tomorrow off to start prepping the house, or maybe Friday. Maybe check the local stores, and see if anyone has something in stock we can get delivered before Saturday.""

""I'll take care of it, Master."" Alexia says. ""I'll come to your office once I think I've got it figured out.""

""Thank you."" Robert says. ""Normally Jane thinks through these things, but anything we can handle before she realizes the scale of the problem is one more thing she doesn't need to worry about.""

""We are going to need more food."" Lucia says. ""We've been shopping for 4, not 12. We have room in the kitchen for more shelves, but we probably need more seating too.""

""Bar stools maybe?"" Alexia says. ""We could fit 3 or 4, if we clear off the counter a bit.""

""Good idea."" Robert says. ""We may have to accept eating in shifts too, at least until we can find a new house with a proper dining room that isn't also Jane's office. As for the food storage, work with Alexia, and see what is in stock that we can either get delivered quickly, or go pickup before Saturday. I suspect things are going to start selling out next week when households start expanding.""

""I hate to ask, but do you think Mistress would mind going shopping one of the next few evenings? I'd like to fully stock the pantry, and we probably need a ton more clothes, bedding, etc too."" Lucia says.

""Would you two be comfortable going with me tomorrow or Friday?"" Robert says. ""If I take the day off, of course. I'd rather not put this all on Jane.""

Lucia looks nervous, but says. ""As long as we can stay with you the whole time.""

""Of course. Anytime you go out, make sure to stay together. Lucia, if you could start putting a list together of items we need, and for the clothing, rough sizes and quantities. We don't need a complete wardrobe, just enough to tide them over."" Robert says. ""There is one other big thing I thought of last night, and it's going to be a problem.""

The girls just look at him, both of them drawing a blank.

""Transportation. Our car can hold 5 at most, and if Jane and I both go to the auction, we are going to need 10 seats potentially to get home."" Robert says.

""My old car is probably still at my work."" Alexia says. ""I don't know where the keys went though, my purse got left at the office.""

""That thing barely ran."" Lucia says. ""I don't think Robert or Jane want to be stranded on the side of the road with a bunch of women they just met. Not quite the best first impression.""

""Lucia is right."" Robert says. ""I appreciate you thinking of it, but we should probably abandon that idea. I could rent a van, I guess, if we get a reservation soon. We probably need to buy something soon though, we can't rent a van every time we want to leave the house after all.""

""Would you like me to see what I can find?"" Alexia asks.

""I'll handle that one."" Robert says. ""I'm sure I'll have time during work. Maybe look at rentals, just in case we have to go that route.""

When breakfast breaks up, Robert heads upstairs to work, and the girls get on with their chores, Alexia working from upstairs so she can listen for Jane and Amber. An hour or so later, as she is pondering how to re-arrange the bunk beds to fit an extra one comfortably, she hears the master bedroom door open. She immediately heads to see if Jane is ready for breakfast.

""Good morning, Mistress."" Alexia says, managing to make it to the hallway before Jane goes down the stairs. ""Would you like breakfast now?""

""Thank you, Alexia. That would be nice. Maybe something small for Amber too, when she wakes up. Scrambled eggs perhaps?"" Jane says. ""And one small pancake?""

""I'll text Lucia right now to get started."" Alexia says. ""Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Maybe a nice relaxing bath or shower?""

""Not right now."" Jane says. ""Go help Lucia, if you don't mind. I need to go over a few things with you both at breakfast.""

""Yes, Mistress."" Alexia says, and then hesitantly asks. ""How is Amber?""

""She's still sleeping."" Jane says. ""I'm going to go grab a pen and paper from Robert's office, so I can leave her a note. I don't want her freaking out when she wakes up alone.""

Alexia heads downstairs to help Lucia with breakfast, and Jane heads to Robert's office.

""Good morning."" Jane says, leaning down to wrap her arms around Robert's neck as he works, and then kissing his head. ""Work busy?""

""Good morning to you too."" Robert says, swiveling his chair slowly to face Jane. ""Work is still slow. I realized last night that we need to start preparing to have a lot more people in this house. I've divided the tasks between the girls and I, and we are going to tackle as much as we can, so you can breathe a bit today.""

""I'm good now."" Jane says. ""I think someone else needs a special day. What do you have Lucia doing?""

""She says we need more food storage, as well as additional places for people to eat, and clothes, toiletries, bedding, etc... She is making shopping lists for all of that, as well as doing a bit of online shopping for bar stools and the food storage."" Robert says. ""I think she's probably going to try to organize the kitchen and pantry a bit more efficiently too.""

""She can work on that part tomorrow."" Jane says. ""As for the shopping lists, I'll work with her to get it done a bit quicker. After that she and I are going to have a girl's day.""

""Oh. I didn't realize Lucia was struggling, apart from her constant jealousy, which we need to work on."" Robert says.

""Not everyone that needs a special day is struggling."" Jane says, and then adds, teasing him a bit. ""Let's call this another surprise for you.""

""If it's half as good as the last surprise, I'm ready for it now."" Robert says.

""Not until after work. Or maybe after dinner. You'll just have to wait and see."" Jane says. ""And tomorrow I want a you and me night. No helpers.""

""Yes, Ma'am."" Robert says. ""You know we can do that any time you ask.""

""I know."" Jane says. ""Realistically, we will have fewer and fewer opportunities, starting in three days.""

""I'll make the opportunities when we need them."" Robert says. ""None of this works without us being rock solid.""

""I love you."" Jane says, hugging him tightly.

""And I love you."" Robert says. ""I sent the list of 5 off last night, by the way. We have to make a bid on all of them, but if you are having second thoughts on some, we can probably avoid getting some of them.""

""I'm not having second thoughts, though I still wish you had picked some of my girls."" Jane says, pouting a bit.

""If we do another auction, and there aren't essential skills we need, I'll let you pick, ok?"" Robert says. ""I never want you to think that your opinion doesn't matter.""

""I know."" Jane says. ""Who knows, the bidding may get out of control on some of these girls anyhow, and we have to save our money for Mei and Amber.""

""Speaking of money, and I hate to bring it up, but we need another vehicle. One that can fit a lot of people."" Robert says. ""Either before the auction, or we need to rent one, and buy something right after it.""

""I'm going to focus on Lucia, so I'll leave that to you. Text me the options you come up with, and we can talk about them later."" Jane says, getting up. ""I'm going to go find her now. I'm going to leave a note for Amber to check in with you when she wakes up. If you don't mind making sure she is ok, and then texting Alexia to keep an eye on her if you are busy, I'd appreciate it.""

""Of course."" Robert says. ""About Amber... I don't know how we figure out consent with someone that is that heavily conditioned to obey...""

""I know, honey."" Jane says. ""I think as long as she doesn't feel like she is being punished or excluded, we wait until after the auction, and after she is healthy.""

""Definitely."" Robert says. ""The skin and bones look doesn't exactly excite me. I feel so bad for what she has gone through.""

""Thankfully all of that is over."" Jane says. ""We need to focus on her recovery, and that starts with love, affection, and food. Other than that, the only other thing we can do is take her for testing as late as possible, and obviously make sure we win the bid on her.""

""Honestly, as skinny as she is, I can't imagine she will get a ton of bids."" Robert says. ""Maybe we can coach her to act totally disinterested in what is going on, that could drive down the price more.""

""Good idea."" Jane says. ""I need to move cash around later today, I know I said we could spend about 25k on bidding, but I don't want to lose Amber or Mei. Do you mind if I consolidate things a bit, so we can go higher if we need to?""

""If we go over the 25k, we will need to only take women who are otherwise not getting many bids in the other auctions."" Robert says. ""We are going to need more space ASAP if we end up with more than like 8 people in the house.""

""I know. I think it's worth it, if you are ok with it."" Jane says.

""I'm ok with it."" Robert says, sighing. ""I can't imagine not coming home with those two. If we have to lose the rest of the auctions, so be it.""

Jane writes her note, and sneaks in to leave it next to Amber, who is sleeping peacefully. Heading downstairs, she finds Lucia making pancakes.

""Lucia, do you have a moment to talk?"" Jane asks.

""Yes, Mistress."" Lucia says. ""Are you doing ok today?""

""I'm fine."" Jane says. ""A bit hungry."" She adds, laughing.

""Amber still asleep?"" Lucia asks, flipping a pancake.

""Yeah, just need food for me right now. I'm going to let her sleep as long as she can."" Jane says.

Lucia flips the pancake onto a plate that already has a few, and takes it to the breakfast table. ""I'll grab the butter and syrup for you.""

""Thank you."" Jane says, and when Lucia comes back, she says. ""Sit with me, let's talk.""

As Jane works on her pancakes, she says. ""Do you still want to lose your virginity to Robert before we bring in anyone else?""

""Absolutely, Mistress."" Lucia says. ""Thank you for asking. I was hoping I wouldn't have to beg you for a night with him.""

""Does tonight work for you?"" Jane asks. ""I want Robert for one night as well before we pack the house full of girls.""

""Tonight is great."" Lucia says, flushing. ""Does he know?""

""Unless he's a total idiot."" Jane says. ""I dropped several hints earlier. So the plan is that you and I work together to get your lists made up that Robert discussed last night, and then we have a girls day. You can ask me anything you have questions about, and closer to time for Robert to get off work, we will get you a nice relaxing bath, and then get you ready to blow his mind. Does that work for you?""

""Yes, thank you Jane."" Lucia says. ""I really appreciate how good you are to me. I don't know how you do it, seeing him with us, and not resenting us.""

""I think I'm wired a bit differently than other people to start with."" Jane says. ""But getting over jealousy took time, and the realization that Robert was the most important thing in my world. I wouldn't want to live without him, or ask him to be anything less than fully fulfilled. And it's not like I don't get to have my own fun with Alexia.""

""That's true."" Lucia says. ""I know it bothers Robert when I get jealous. Can you help me work on that? I don't want to make him unhappy.""

""He knows that it's natural, and that you can't help it."" Jane says. ""We've talked about it a bit. As long as you don't let it affect your relationships with him, or the other people in the house, you are fine. Robert is your first and only love, and it's natural to want to guard that.""

""Thank you."" Lucia says. ""I do plan to work on it though.""

""Good."" Jane says. ""I'm always here if you need to talk. Let's get these lists done, so we can really start the day. Where is Alexia?""

""I've got her looking at the profiles, trying to figure out what sizes of clothes they each wear."" Lucia says. ""After that she's going to get back to figuring out the sleeping arrangements.""

""Good. Let's focus on things that are adjustable, and then once we get them in the house, we can size them properly. Some of them may have clothes somewhere we can go get, like we did with you and Alexia."" Jane says, casting a critical eye over the pantry. ""We may need a full room pantry in the next house. So many mouths to feed.""

""Unless we have a grocery store within walking distance, I think you are right. Maybe 3 deep freezers too, especially if we are worried about shortages."" Lucia says.",,2025-08-15T18:47:36.661232,3745,
https://www.literotica.com/s/high-life-alice-makes-a-change-pt-05,High Life: Alice Makes a Change Pt. 05,Unknown Author,,,,,"[Author's note: Alice is married to James, a professional football player who has found himself at a loose end after retiring from the sport. After attending a charity auction in which she was outbid for her own husband, Alice and James have been blackmailed into service by Jodie and her upper-echelon friends. They have no choice but to do her bidding, letting Jodie pimp James out to clients, otherwise she will release the videos she took.]

---

DOMINANT

Jodie got in contact the next day, giving me a time and a place to meet. She told me not to be late. That was it, after everything we'd been through, after taking on four women in one night: just a single line message. I went alone, leaving James with the boys. I took a little grim delight in denying her the opportunity of close contact with my husband.

Jodie was waiting for me at a restaurant on the high street, sitting at an outside table in the shade of an umbrella. The timing was odd: meet at a quarter to one in the afternoon. The situation was odd too, beckoned to take a seat opposite her, but no place laid out for me. My confusion must have shown.

""You're not staying, Alice,"" she told me, ""I'm meeting a friend here at one, might as well kill two birds with one stone.""

She inclined her head, eyes fixed on me.

""So,"" she continued, ""What did you learn from your little encounter?""

I kept silent.

""Did you learn what happens if you decide it's okay to cross me?""

Her lips twitched in a tight smile.

""We can make this as hard as you want, Alice, but in the end I'm always going to win. You have absolutely no leverage in this situation.""

""Are you sure?"" I fired back, to which Jodie laughed.

""Zero, and less and less every passing day. Have you figured that out yet? The videos of you two, that was just the start of it, a taster, to get you to do what I want. We're way past that now.""

""That's what I want to talk about, Jodie. I want to know how we get those videos back. What do we need to do?""

""You want to do a deal? Did the little party in the spa change your thinking? Do you want to do a deal now?""

""I want to know what it would cost.""

Jodie unlocked her phone and tapped on the screen. She placed it on the table in front of me, showing a video of two figures fucking on a couch.

""You can have these back for free, Alice. Is that going to make you happy?""

My eyes snapped up from the screen to her face. She was smiling at me.

""Really?""

""Yes, really. They were useful, but they've served their purpose,"" she replied, her tone light and conversational, but then she leaned closer.

""You see, Alice, I have something a lot better now.""

I shuddered, seeing something dark in her eyes. A cold dread crept through me.

""Like what?""

""Can't you guess Alice?""

""No.""

""I have your bookings.""

I shook my head. ""I don't understand,"" I replied.

""A sex tape, let's face it, is quite embarrassing. But, it's survivable, especially with your husband being a sportsman. His colleagues have done a lot worse over the years, it's a low bar. Even if he'd become a drinker, found himself pulled over to the side of the road over the limit, that's survivable. If he'd gotten himself mixed up in drugs, which is pretty common with athletes, it would make an awful scene.""

Jodie paused, and I found myself genuinely afraid of what she was going to say next.

""A magazine piece, maybe even a talk show segment, you could eventually draw a line under all those things. A great deal of harm to your reputation, your family, his future career prospects, but survivable.""

""Just get to the point, Jodie.""

""Yes, good idea. The point, Alice, is that there was a way through all this, provided you had a high tolerance for the damage that would ensue. But now, we're a long way past that. Drinking, drugs, that's all one thing, and eventually yesterday's news, but not what you're doing now.""

""And what is that?"" I growled, struggling to keep my voice low and even in a public place.

""You're pimping your husband out for money, Alice. You're advertising his body for sex. What kind of woman would do that? Is she a good wife, or a fit mother?""

My mouth dropped open.

""That's right, Alice, you've gone from virtuous wife to pond scum, and that story will stick to you forever.""

""And so are you,"" I hissed, ""You're in the middle of all this.""

""Oh, I don't think so. I meet up with you for coffee occasionally, or bump into you out shopping. The ad in the High Life section goes to an untraceable email address. I'm as shocked as everyone else that you're living a secret perverted life as a sex slut. You always seemed so normal, but then, it's always the quiet ones, isn't it?""

Jodie shook her head in mock disapproval.

""Why are you doing this to us?"" I grated, feeling my voice shake.

""Well, as you know, it's not about the money, Alice. For my amusement, I suppose. Talking of which, Marielle was glowing in her praise of your husband. Well done. I take it she paid in full?""

I nodded tersely.

""Then I'll take my agent fee. Fifty percent. You brought it, didn't you?""

""I thought this wasn't about the money.""

""It's not. It's about the look on your face as you hand over my cut.""

Jodie placed a hand on the table, waiting. It took me several long seconds to dip into my handbag and pull out a small envelope. I slid it across the table to her and she covered it with her hand.

""I have your next booking. Friday night. Her name is Phoebe. I'll send you the details, and I know you'll do a good job.""

Jodie hesitated, her hand still on the envelope.

""How did you enjoy your little dress-up, by the way?""

""You mean that maid costume. It was cheap and awful.""

""I bet you were quite the picture in it.""

I sat back, folding my arms, determined not to give her any more ammunition. The costume was still vivid in my memory: the way it stretched over my body, the cheap synthetic fabric tight against my skin, the humiliation of the hemline barely covering my crotch. Jodie was clearly revelling in my discomfort, pondering something. She pushed the envelope back towards me.

""Don't you want it?"" I asked.

""Take it.""

""Why?""

""I think I should invest a little, maybe rectify a problem.""

""What problem?""

""You.""

Jodie's finger waved in my general direction.

""You're so dowdy,"" she continued, ""I can only imagine how it looks when you both arrive. James is naked soon enough, but that leaves you, doesn't it? You're an unwelcome distraction from the talent.""

She nudged the envelope again and it fell off the table into my lap.

""Well, I think we need to get you rectified. I'm going to send you a couple of addresses. Use the money, turn up, follow the instructions. Let's see if we can't lose the housewife chic. Now, ah, hello.""

Jodie looked past me, her attention fixed on someone across the restaurant.

""Time for you to scoot. My lunch date has arrived. Come on, up. We're done here.""

She made little shooing motions and I got up, scanning the restaurant for a glimpse of the person she was meeting.

""Go, Alice. Now.""

I turned back to Jodie, my face colouring at being dismissed so casually, but she was ignoring me now. Jodie rose from her seat and made her way across the floor, leaving me standing forgotten by the table. Our conversation was over. I ducked my head and headed in the opposite direction, back onto the street.

---

I could hear James downstairs, talking to my father. Young voices were calling out. In the middle of the commotion, my husband's tone became stern and the hubbub subsided. There were a few more words, and then I heard the front door close. The house was silent.

""You nearly ready?"" James called up the stairs.

""Just a few minutes,"" I called back.

""We don't want to be late.""

""I know,"" I replied, irritably.

I turned back to the mirror, staring at myself again. I unwound the towel, revealing my naked body, taking in the unfamiliar sight. Jodie had taken care of the arrangements, booking me in for a wax and a spray tan at one of the high-end places in the main street, and then the hair salon. The women who had attended me had made comments, enough for me to realise that Jodie had made the booking as if she was James, sending his wife to be pampered. The hair stylist bleached my hair, losing the red that I'd had since my earliest memories. Each time, I smiled and thanked them for their work and then I took money from the envelope and paid.

My eyes traced over my golden skin, down my bare front, stopping again at the blank space between my legs, no longer reddened from the waxing, just clean and bare. My legs and armpits were the same, stripped of all hair, but my crotch held my attention. There was something alien about being hairless for the first time since puberty, as if Jodie had managed to strip my womanhood from me. Worse, I had been unable to stop it, nodding meekly as the woman told me to lie on my back while she applied the hot wax strips.

Now, I was as she wanted me to be, my hair primped into a tight blonde bun, my makeup done, my body on display. I crossed over to the bed and unwrapped my clothes from their tissue paper.

This had been my second surprise, being directed to a specialist lingerie shop. The assistant had already been briefed. Apparently, I had already ordered online and I was there to pick up my new outfit. Once again, Jodie had made sure of every detail. I'd grabbed the bag and paid, using up the last of the money in the envelope, burning with shame as the assistant flashed me a little knowing smile.

My purchase was spread out before me. I was trying to gather the strength to put it on.

""We're going to be late,"" James called out to me.

""Just a minute,"" I called back.

Now or never. I picked up the garment, holding it against my bare skin, feeling the slickness of the material pressed against me. Jodie had arranged for me a short, clinging latex dress and matching stiletto heels, both in reflective black. I ran a hand over the slick material, shuddering. It was long-sleeved, with a plunging neckline and a built-in padding to hold my cleavage. There was no underwear: I would be bare underneath. I didn't even have stockings.

The dress was in a single piece, without a zip, and I pulled it carefully over my head, trying not to spoil my hair. It seemed to stick to me, gripping my skin, and I had to fight and tug to get it into position, pushing my breasts into the pre-formed cups, sliding my hands through the long, slick sleeves, finally pulling the dress down over my bottom.

The hem stopped mid-thigh, and I took another minute to pull and cajole the dress down, desperate for every additional inch of coverage I could wrestle from it. I could feel the air around my exposed crotch and for some reason that made me feel more naked than I had been before I'd put the dress on. Reluctantly, I slipped into the heels and turned to face myself in the mirror.

I wanted to cry. The woman staring back at me, body pressed tightly into the shiny black dress, legs bare, calves sculpted by murderously high stilettos, looked nothing like me. Her golden skin, her smoky eyeshadow, her glossy, pouty red lips: a stranger I didn't recognise. How had we come to this?

""My God.""

Startled, I pivoted on my heels to find James standing in the bedroom doorway, grey eyes inspecting me. I made a move to cover myself up, but he came up to me, wrapping his fingers around my wrists, prying my arms gently away.

""Don't do that. You look beautiful.""

""I look like a plastic blonde Barbie doll.""

I was painfully aware that my own father was out the front of our house, bundling the boys into the car for a sleepover. If he knew what his daughter was doing upstairs, it would have broken his heart. James turned me around, making me do a spin for him.

""Do we get to keep the dress?"" he asked.

""I guess.""

""It would be a shame not to.""

A grin spread across his face.

""James, don't. I'm not....""

""I know. But, Alice, you could stop traffic looking like that. You're stunning.""

I looked into his eyes, willing myself to just let go and roll with it, forget the humiliation within at being made to look like some kind of fetish fantasy.

""I'm just, uh, I feel so embarrassed.""

""No need. If there's anyone who should feel embarrassed, it's me, half an hour from now, stark naked in someone's living room.""

""I don't think I can do this, James.""

""You can. We can. It's easy, this time. Just one girl.""

He hugged me to him.

""You're beautiful. We're going to go do this, and then I'm going to enjoy the night with you. Okay?""

""But they're going to see me, like this?""

""And they're going to weep with envy. Perfect body, perfect face,"" James replied, ""Perfect man.""

He burst out laughing and it shattered the tension. I pulled away from him, jabbing my fingers into his ribs, making him squirm.

""Hey, back off, that's abuse,"" he roared.

""I'll show you abuse,"" I countered.

James was quick, stepping around me, landing a hand on my bottom, making me jolt. I spun around but he was already out of reach, barrelling to the door.

""Too slow, Alice, too slow.""

I pursued him, but he called back over his shoulder to me, ""And in those heels, even walking's a liability.""

""Wait 'til I get hold of you,"" I growled, trying to hide a smile, watching him scuttle down the stairs.

""I'll be waiting all night at this rate. Way too slow.""

---

The address was halfway across the city and with the evening traffic it took us nearly an hour. Underneath my trenchcoat, the latex was clinging wetly against me as I perspired.

""Can we go cooler?"" I asked, again.

""It's already freezing.""

""I'm still sweating.""

""I'm not.""

""You're not the one covered in goddamn latex. You should try wearing this stuff.""

""I'll stick to looking at it, if that's okay. Anyway, it wouldn't fit me.""

""Sure? It stretches a long way.""

James adjusted the aircon again and reached across to settle his large hand on my knee.

""Better?""

""Not sure. I feel like I'm marinading.""

""There soon.""

I crossed my legs, feeling the slickness of the perspiration on my skin. There was more to it though, something I didn't want to confess to my husband. Legs crossed, I was painfully aware of the way my thighs pressed together, compressing my bare pussy under the latex. I felt a little shiver of excitement. Perhaps James was right, perhaps we should keep the dress for later.

We pulled up in front of an apartment block in one of the more affluent suburbs. James got out, coming around to my side to open my door for me and help me out of my seat. I took his hand, steadying myself on my tall heels, straightening the tiny latex dress beneath my coat.

""Ready?"" James asked.

""Uh huh.""

""Okay, game time.""

""James, you don't have to do that every time.""

""What?""

""Game time.""

""Okay.""

""We're not playing the finals, we're just....""

I stopped myself, giving him a terse smile instead. We're just going upstairs to fuck a stranger and get paid for it. No, that wasn't helping. I punched a number sequence on the keypad and the door lock clicked to let us in. James called the elevator and pressed the button for the fifth floor.

""Some couples do this for fun,"" James said, after the doors had closed.

I blinked up at him.

""I'm just saying, it's a thing.""

""Not with us,"" I retorted, ""We're not doing this for fun.""

""But what if we were?""

""James,"" I scowled, ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""Remember the night of the auction, after, when we pretended you'd bought my services. It was pretty hot.""

""I remember, but I don't see how....""

""What if that's what we were doing now? Let's say we've gone onto one of those specialist dating apps, and we're about to meet up with people we've been chatting to online, people who share this lifestyle. How would that feel?""

""You feeling okay?""

""Seriously, what if that's what we're doing, and we're not just doing what Jodie set us up to do, if it's an adventure?""

""Let me get this straight,"" I huffed, ""I'm in an elevator in a latex dress that only comes down as far as my belly button to watch my husband fuck another woman because I enjoy it?""

The elevator pinged and after a moment, the doors opened.

""I'm just saying,"" James replied, defensively.

""I know, I can hear you. These ears do work, you know. Which way?""

""Left. Apartment five.""

James strode down the hallway while I tottered behind, cursing Jodie and her footwear choices. It was a very specific hell, inflicted by one woman on another, to be forced into six-inch heels. I caught up with him just as he knocked on the door.

""I'm just saying,"" he murmured, ""We came here to party, like the old days, pre-kids. We're here to get wild. Can you do that?""

I didn't reply, staring at the closed door. I knew what he was saying, flipping the game in his head, looking for the angles. If we pretended, then this wasn't so bad. We were just playing roles. The awfulness went away. A chain rattled on the other side of the door and I took in a sharp breath.

""I can do that, James, let's be that.""

I felt his hand in the small of my back.

""I love you, Alice.""

A woman opened the door. She was older than us by about a decade, in her late forties, a fuller figure with pretty eyes and a nervousness in her movements.

My husband held out his hand, saying, ""I'm James, this is Alice.""

The woman looked down at his hand for a moment, then shook it, rousing from her inaction.

""I'm Phoebe. Come in.""

Phoebe led us into the apartment, with James bringing up the rear. He tapped me on the shoulder, plucking the collar of my coat and I understood. Steadying my nerves, I undid my buttons and let him take my coat from me. Phoebe's eyes went wide, looking me up and down.

""Oh,"" she uttered, ""Well.""

""You have a nice place,"" I said, ""Beautiful view.""

I made a show of looking around. The apartment was open-plan, with a kitchen and dining area off to one side and what looked like bathrooms and bedroom to the other. The far side was floor-to ceiling glass, with sliding doors opening out onto a balcony overlooking the hills.

""Thank you.""

We came to a halt next to the lounge suite. James folded up my coat and laid it down on the arm of a chair. Phoebe looked from my husband to me, then back to James again. We lapsed into an awkward silence.

""So,"" she said, ""Uh, how does this work?""

""Any way you want it to,"" James replied smoothly.

""I've never done this.""

""Perfectly fine. We can sit and talk, get to know each other a bit. We can have a few drinks if you want, or anything else you want.""

""So, if I told you to get naked now, would you do that?""

""Of course.""

My eyes never left my husband's face, watching him negotiate the terms of the engagement with this stranger. He was playing the game, like we'd chosen to be here, like we did this for fun. Phoebe turned to me, taking in my dress again.

""I, uh, I wasn't expecting you to wear... I mean, I feel a little underdressed.""

James smiled reassuringly at her, saying, ""It doesn't matter. It's only temporary anyway, isn't it?""

Phoebe stepped back, startled.

""Oh, no. Sorry, there's a... maybe this is a mistake.""

I frowned, shooting a look at my husband. James nodded patiently.

""Uh, look, how about we have that drink? Do you want to take a seat? Let me get it, what'll you have?""

Phoebe told James where the drinks were and then she and I settled into the armchairs. I snuggled back, crossing my legs tightly, acutely aware of how exposed I would be in my short dress to anyone sitting opposite me. James fixed gin and tonics for us, whiskey for him, busying himself in the kitchen area. I stole a look across at James, but he just shrugged.

James returned, and I accepted my gin from him. He settled down on the couch and Phoebe seemed to take a moment to steady herself. She took a large gulp of her drink.",,2025-08-15T18:47:43.119252,3624,

********

Samson And The Delilahs

8pm Sunday

No Cover Charge!

So read the signboard on wheels in front of Gazonga's Roadhouse & Cabaret. A flashing arrow pointed to a squat one-story building in the gravel parking lot. The place did not look like much but rock'n'roll history was about to be made there tonight. At least, the band hoped it might. This would be their first gig ever.

Inside, the joint was packed. College kids jockeyed for position around the stage. Bikers and metalheads hung out by the bar. The lights went

down

. The cheers went

UP.

A loud bass note thrummed through the murky interiors of the club. Kagney took a step forward into the spotlight. She had played in a couple bar bands for free beer. While awaiting imminent fame and fortune, the buxom redhead day jobbed as a stripper. She made fucktons of cash and eventually got promoted to club manager. The owner was in rehab and let her run the place with minimal interference as long as it turned a profit. Accordingly, Kags had zero arms to twist in transforming Gazonga's into a concert venue for the night.

The guitar cut through the bass line like a buzzsaw. The spotlight moved to Dredd Hott. She had more stage experience than the rest of the band combined. Like Kagney, Ms. Hott danced for her day job. However, the alt-babe became Insta-famous and set up an insanely lucrative side hustle as a camgirl. Dredd was the entire package. She looked every inch the rock star from her pink and white dreadlocks down to her thigh-high vinyl boots. And while the metal trolls wrote her off as a pretty face on social media, Hott honed her guitar skills for a decade, out-shredding the biggest boys in the biz.

DONK! DONK! DONK! A pounding cowbell joined the mix. Sandra Kong played the drums. Like her bandmates, she stripped. The locals knew her by the stage name of ""Queen Kong."" Sandra considered herself more of a hobbyist than a musician but it felt damn good being up there right then. While the former high-school valedictorian had done a couple semesters of jazz drumming as an extracurricular, the band's hard rock sound required a much heavier, primal beat. She hammered on those drums with startling intensity. The pounding felt cathartic. Sandra's veins ran with tiger blood and she needed an outlet for her aggression, especially when the source of her teenage angst stood only ten feet away.

Lance bounded onto the stage, grabbed the mic stand with one hand, and his baritone thundered through the PA system.

""Heartbreaker, soul shaker...""

The crowd went mad. At 19, Lance Leo was already a legend. The teenage superstud lived a life other dudes could only dream of.

If you knew him from high school, Lance was the star quarterback who seduced every member of the varsity cheerleading squad in a single semester. After his team won the state championship, Leo entertained many offers to play football at Big 10 Schools. Unfortunately, the major league player got expelled senior year after getting caught in a raucous threesome with two faculty members. Bev Johnson was a gym instructor. Katie Marx taught biology. He was already 18 and legal but the disciplinary board ruled the straight-F student received passing grades from his teachers in exchange for sex.

If you knew him from the strip club, Lance was the six-and-a-half foot tall bouncer that carded customers at the door. The bodybuilding playboy invariably wore a Motley Crue tank top that showed off a pair of guns larger than your head. You didn't fuck around in there, especially not with the girls on stage. The rakish brute dated the headline dancer Queen Kong who invited other performers at the club to sleep with them.

If you knew him from Bradley University, Lance was the male stripper that danced at sorority parties. The townie laid half the female student body before getting banned from campus for beating up three no-neck frat boys from Alpha Gamma. He also streaked across the quad on a dare but that incident happened on a different night.

If you knew him from PornHub, Lance was the porn star that nailed the hottest camgirls on the planet. He performed under the pseudonym 'Samson"" but everyone in Peoria knew who he was. Unlike most of the overproduced crap that came from the commercial studios, Samson's videos were 100% real and raw. They all featured stunning foxes experiencing very intense orgasms at the hands of a sexual virtuoso with a ten-and-a-half inch cock.

By now, you probably detected a pattern in the many guises of Lance Leo, or 'Samson' as some now called him. The wildman embraced an ultra-hedonistic lifestyle that read like a back issue of Penthouse Forum. While 'rock musician' could have been just another iteration of the dilettante's oversexed persona, Lance possessed a surprisingly powerful voice as well as the perfect 'fuck you' attitude to front a heavy metal band. The audience avidly followed Samson's moves as the born performer karate kicked and split jumped his way around the stage with gleeful exuberance.

""Now you're messin' with..."" Lance screamed out the falsetto chorus. ""A SON OF A BITCH!!!"" Without even thinking, he thrust his pelvis to the beat of the song, flaunting the provocative bulge in his skintight leather pants. The organ ran down the inseam of his left pant leg with the subtlety of a lead pipe.

Some were impressed. Others were not.

""What a clown,"" Paulie told his girlfriend. ""He must have stuffed an entire roll of toilet paper down his pants.""

Melissa didn't answer her playa-hater boyfriend. His fragile ego wouldn't be able to handle the undeniable truth that dangled between Samson's thighs. The only reason Paulie wanted to go to the concert tonight was because Dredd Hott was playing. Jake had a famous YouTube channel and once hired her to appear in one of his stupid prank videos. He had met the Insta-model because she got all of her ink at Melissa's tattoo parlor and the women sometimes shared a doobie after the shop closed. So, in the murk of his monkey brain, her boyfriend probably figured he could score a threesome because both of them were bi. That was so not happening...

Truth be told, Paulie wasn't the only one who hadn't come for the music. The guys in the audience lusted after the female members. And the girls lusted after Samson's member. The lead singer's gigantic penis had become an urban legend around Peoria. So it seemed only fitting that the band closed with a cover of Aerosmith's ""Big Ten Inch Record.""

I cover her with kisses

And when we're in a lover's clinch

She gets all excited

When she begs for my big ten inch

Record of a band that plays the blues

Well a band that plays the blues

She just love my big ten inch

Record of her favorite blues

The ladies in the audience chuckled at the double-entendre. While the song sounded goofy coming from the lips of Steven Tyler, Samson's rendition made it ironically autobiographical.

An impressive thunder of applause rocked through the club as they finished the number. As soon as the lights went up, Paulie walked past his girlfriend and made a beeline for the stage. He closed in on Dredd even before she had a chance to unstrap her guitar.

""Yo, Dredd,"" called out Jake. ""What up? What up?""

""Hi, ummm... Jake, right?"" answered Dredd in a tone somewhere between apathetic and withering.

""So when are we gonna do another video together? My last one fucking broke TikTok!""

""I didn't know TikTok was broken,"" she deadpanned. ""Did it get fixed yet?""

Dredd broke eye contact and focused on packing up her gear, hoping against hope this dude would figure out how to get lost. However, he pitched her on late-night drinks at his place so they could have 'a chat' about his next video. Based on his leer, she knew exactly where that would head. Thankfully, Lance interrupted their clunker of a conversation.

""Hey, babe,"" he smiled. ""You coming to the jam session tonight?""

""I'm still thinking about it,"" she flirted. Lance leaned down and whispered something in her ear that made her smile. Meanwhile, Paulie just stood there like a doofus. Notably, the elevated stage put Samson's crotch at eye-level, offering explicit proof that his veined python was more than a sock.

""Yo, Dredd,"" the D-list celeb crowed. ""You want to join the Paulie Jake movement? Or you gonna hang with that Mr. Universe wannabe?""

""I'm gonna pass on those drinks,"" Dredd told Jake. ""Actually, make that a hard pass.""

Lance glared down at Paulie. The pretty boy had a boxer's physique but guys like him were 90% bravado. An experienced bouncer could beat the crap out of him in his sleep. Dredd shook her head as if to say ""Don't waste your time on that loser.""

""Dude,"" Lance finally told him. ""Stop staring at my junk. It creeps me out."" With that, he walked off with a chuckle.

""Fuckin' skank,"" Paulie muttered to Dredd before stomping off. Melissa stood at the bar, waiting for her Cosmo.

""Let's bust this joint,"" her boyfriend ordered. ""Who wants to hang in a podunk strip club?""

""I just ordered a drink,"" Melissa countered.

""Drinks at my place. C'mon.""

Paulie grabbed her arm and led her out into the parking lot. Melissa seethed with anger. Dating a YouTube star had its perks but they were well on their way to splitsville. So she made a spot decision.

""Let go of my arm,"" she told him.

""Huh?""

""I've got a drink waiting for me inside. I'm going back.""

""GET IN THE FUCKING CAR!"" he exploded, yanking her by the arm towards his Porsche.

Melissa wrenched her arm out of his grasp and marched back towards the club. Before Paulie could chase after her, a tall lithe figure stepped out of the shadows and blocked his path.

""Not sure if you got the memo,"" the female stranger told him. ""But I believe the lady said 'no.''""

The woman wore a crop top and cut-off jeans that showed off her long sinuous limbs. She did not look like UFC material but definitely oozed a ""don't mess with me"" vibe.

""Who the fuck are you?"" snarled Paulie.

""I'm the one who provides sensitivity training around here.""

""Try me, bitch,"" Paulie retorted. The stranger promptly lunged forward with a roundhouse kick that struck him in the side of the head. The blow knocked Paulie onto his ass.

""Now regarding that training,"" she told him. ""Your head may be feeling acute sensitivity in the morning.""

By the time Paulie got up, a couple people from the club had wandered outside to check out the action. Someone took out their cell phone. For a social media icon like Paulie, that was worse than pulling a gun. If any part of this incident got caught on tape, his career would go up in a puff of digital smoke. Paulie hopped in his Porsche and screeched out of the parking lot.

""C'mon,"" the stranger told her. ""You got a drink waiting for you at the bar.""

TWO MINUTES LATER

""Who are you?"" Melissa asked between sips of her Cosmo.

""The patrons know me as Queen Kong but just call me Sandra.""

""You dance here?""

""I also play drums in the band.""

""So you know Dredd Hott then?""

""Yup.""

""I did a lot of her ink.""

""Cool. Maybe we all can hang sometime.""

""Yeah, Dredd something about a jam session tonight.""

""She invited you?"" chuckled Sandra with a hint of surprise.

""Not exactly. Why?""

""You staring at my tits?"" Sandra asked out of the blue, dodging Melissa's question by posing one of her own.

""Why, no!"" she answered defensively. ""OK, sort of.""

""I'm used to it,"" Sandra reassured her. ""I make a living off dudes gawking at them.""

""Wow, they must be a...""

""Triple D. I had to wear two sports bras to keep them from bouncing in my face when I drummed tonight.""

""Ever thought of getting them reduced?""

""Nah, I yam what I yam.""

""OK, Popeye.""

""What about you? Do you know who you are?""

""That's a bit of an open-ended question.""

""Then let me narrow it down for you. You wanna touch them?""

""Yeah,"" Melissa nodded, upping the ante. Her new friend looked smoking hot and did not beat around the bush. She dug her style

Sandra gently grabbed Mel's wrist and laid her palm on the underside of her breast. Melissa hefted the fleshy boulder. It felt heavy in her hand. And delectably supple. This was no implant. Melissa inked many strippers but never met one with such big naturals.

She looked up at Sandra. Her eyes sparkled. The vamp wore a provocative smile that dared you to kiss her. Still, Melissa hesitated. She never made out with a girl in the middle of a packed bar. So Sandra took the initiative. She leaned forward on her barstool and gave her a big wet smooch on the mouth.

""You're a little forward,"" Melissa tut-tutted.

""But you had your hand on my breast,"" Sandra shot back with a smile before resuming the kiss.

Naturally, their girl-girl canoodling attracted not a few prying eyes around the club. Melissa instinctively pulled back a bit.

""Let's continue this in the VIP Room,"" Sandra whispered in her ear.

""The what?""

""The VIP. Haven't you been to a strip club before?""

""Not really.""

""Then let me give you the grand tour."" Sandra announced and took her by the hand. ""And maybe I'll throw in a free lap dance.""

It wasn't much of a tour. Sandra led her right back through the beaded curtain of the VIP room. They entered a stall at the end of the corridor. The space vibed sleazy chic, everything covered in red velvet and mirrors.

""Have a seat,"" Sandra told her, pointing to the comfy couch in the corner. Melissa obliged. The stripper took a step back to admire her new acquaintance. Mel wore her dyed blue-black hair in a cute Bettie Page. She had pale skin that really made her ruby red lipstick pop. As one would expect of a tattoo artist, her whole body was heavily inked with flowers and dragons. She had the 'bad girl' look down cold. However, Sandra remained unintimidated. Melissa talked the talk. Queen Kong walked the walk.

Almost on cue, ""Maneater"" from Nelly Furtado seeped in from the barroom PA which gave Sandra a soundtrack for her performance. Without missing a beat, Queen Kong straddled the tattoo girl's thighs and began to bump and grind the hell out of her. While madly gyrating her hips, Sandra pulled off her crop top and tossed it over her shoulder. Underneath, she wore a pink compression sports bra. That came off next to reveal... A second sports bra!

Sandra had not been lying about needing to wear two bras. The second one struggled to contain her jiggling boobage. It clearly did not provide adequate support. So when she tore that one off, Melissa beheld the mother of all titty drops. Freed of their bondage, Sandra's knockers almost

exploded

from her chest. While she already looked buxom in two high-compression sports bras, the garments held back a bounty of flesh in their double-stitched lycra.

If Jessica Rabbit had come to life, she still would not have been able to out-vamp Queen Kong. Sandra had an incredibly shapely and sexy figure. Her massive bust gave a middle finger to the laws of gravity.

""Oh, my God!"" squealed Melissa. ""Look at you. You're like Ms. Impossible!""

Before she could gush further, Sandra buried Mel's face in her more-than-ample cleavage. Just like Kong anticipated, her new friend loved the lap dance. She probably could bang Melissa right in the VIP if things heated up a few more degrees. However, a knock on the door put a pause on their girlfun.

""Yessss..."" Sandra drawled sarcastically.

Melissa glanced over her shoulder to find no one other than

SAMSON

in the doorway. Her pulse spiked. Her heart thumped. She went all tingly and fluttery, her emotions tangled up in a knot that made her stomach clench tight. After all, Mel just got caught by a stranger in the middle of a lap dance. And to make matters even more blushworthy, that stranger happened to be a MALE SEX GOD.

Melissa had been one of the 7 million people that saw Samson's video with Dredd Hott on PornHub. She had stumbled upon it one morning after Paulie accidentally left open a browser tab on his laptop from the night before. Mel rarely looked at porn but her curiosity about Dredd's X-rated film career got the better of her. However, she watched the entire video mostly because of her dashing co-star.

The first thing that struck her was the expression he wore, something between a sneer and a smirk. That look betrayed a certain arrogance but did not detract from his impossibly handsome visage, the likes of which could only belong to that rarest of ladykillers... A man who could take whatever he wanted from a woman and make her love him for it.

Melissa unconsciously began to finger herself as she watched. The lovers looked so beautiful in their shiny coat of sweat, loudly grunting and moaning as they mated. The hour long video played out like a feverish wet dream, the way Dredd squirmed in delight, losing herself completely, the gouts of girlcum that squirted out of her pussy each time she climaxed. And to say nothing of Samson's almost superhuman virility. He delivered four separate cumshots on camera. And instead of allowing himself to cool down after an orgasm, he just repositioned her and buried himself right back into the pink, eliciting surprised and depraved moans from his partner.

Even more impressive, Samson held none other than Dredd Hott in his thrall. Based on their chats at the tattoo parlor, Melissa knew the famous cam girl only did porn shoots for the money. Dredd complained how she never got her rocks off with a male actor. The self-confessed ""size queen"" never found a guy that measured up to her standards. Melissa could sympathize. Paulie also fell short. But, as for Samson, one of the comments on his video summed him up perfectly: ""Being fucked like this will change you. No one will ever be able to compare.""

Truth be told, Melissa felt her panties go a little damp after watching him in concert tonight. But now her insides almost began to

gush

as he stood just five feet away from him in the VIP lounge. Up close and personal, she could not get over his utter massiveness. Samson truly appeared larger than life, standing six-and-a-half feet tall with a musclebound torso that filled the entire doorway. He had not bothered to put on a shirt since his performance. A guy like him looked better without one.

Seeing Mel checking him out, that smug grin of his passed across his face for a moment. However, he did not ogle her back.

""Hey, babe,"" he said to Sandra. ""You coming to the jam session tonight?""

""Sure, I'll catch up with you later,"" she answered.

""Cool. See ya.""

With that, he spun on his heel and shut the door to give the women their privacy back.

""Who was that?"" asked Melissa disingenuously.",,2025-08-15T18:47:49.104899,3433,
https://www.literotica.com/s/cuckqueaned-by-mistress-irene,Cuckqueaned by Mistress Irene,Unknown Author,,,,,"I finished cooking dinner, and ran upstairs to finish getting ready for my fiancé James. He messaged me a little bit ago telling me that he had a surprise for me, and he wanted me to be dressed in my absolute best for when he got home.

He had me cook enough food for four but asked me to set out two place settings at the table, and bring out my bowl for when I liked playing puppy. I couldn't imagine why he would ask me to wear the nice clothes if he was just going to make me eat out of a dog bowl, but also two place settings. So maybe my surprise was a puppy.

I showered and changed quickly and made my way down stairs. I was just dishing out the cooled down meal when the door opened and James walked in with a woman, and a man. In comparison the woman was tall, almost as tall as James' 6'4"" frame. She had dark black hair that rivaled my own Auburn hair in length. I was on the bustier side with DDD boobs and a thick ass and thighs, but a smaller waist the typical womanly figure. This woman was slimmer than me, but still had what looked like perfect breasts, and ass.

The man I had to assume was our puppy for the night. He was much shorter than the woman, probably an inch or two taller than my 5'4"" frame. He was lean, but looked like he had some muscle behind his clothes. Not nearly as built as James', but a nice form none the less. He had brown hair that was short on the sides but swooped down over his forehead in front. James was only 38 so he didn't have that salt and pepper look that I liked so much yet, but he had a full head of dark hair. So, I can only hope that one day he might.

I walked over to meet James at the door like he would expect. ""Hey. Sweety. How was your day?"" he asked, as he wrapped his arm around me, and pulled me in for a hug.

""It was good. I got dinner ready just as you asked,"" I said quietly into his chest.

He pulled back slightly and placed a kiss on my head. ""I want to introduce you to our new friends."" He gestured to the woman ""Aria, this is Irene, our new friend. We can talk more about that over dinner, and this is her pup Frank. For now, you can call him pup, but if things work out the way we hope they will. She would like you to name him.""

Irene waved to me as opposed to reaching out her hand for a shake. I appreciated that. ""Hi, Aria. I'm excited to get to know you over dinner like your D.. like James said first, I have to get my pup comfortable. He doesn't like to wear clothes, so don't be alarmed if you see him running around without any on. He's probably going to explore a bit, he's curious like that. If everything goes okay during dinner, I would love for you to play with my pup for a bit after dinner. He likes attention.

While Irene stripped her puppy I walked to the kitchen with James. He pulled out a seat in front of one of the place settings, and said ""For Irene"". He then grabbed my hand and walked me to the other side of the table in front of the other place setting. He took a seat, and pulled me onto his lap. Not something we've ever done before, but I wasn't complaining.

He rubbed my back as we waited for Irene to join us. First pup came through sniffing everything. James had to push him away when he got a little too excited sniffing me.

Irene came in a couple minutes later and took her seat, across from us. ""Thank you for this wonderful looking meal.""

I was getting ready to reply when James beat me to it. ""Of, course. I promise you'll love it. Aria is a wonderful little cook.""

""I can't wait to dig in."" she looked to me ""Aria, do you mind if I ask you some questions while we eat?""

I nodded, but James tapped my butt. ""Use your words.""

I felt the blush creep up from my neck, ""I don't mind""

""Great. So, James here tells me that you're both involved in a D/s relationship. Is that correct.""

""Yes.""

""Perfect. James also tells me that you've recently tried a different form of submission. One where he humiliates you, as he jacks off looking at other women. Is this also true?""

I felt my blush deepen. I nodded, and again James tapped my butt and reminded me to use my words.

""Yes, that's true.""

""Good girl."" she said as James began rubbing circles on my back.

""Tell me Aria. Do you enjoy this form of humiliation?""

I started to nod, but continued with words ""Yes. I do.""

""Wonderful. Now let me tell you a little about myself and why I'm here. My name is obviously Irene, I'm 40. I've been in the scene for quite some time. We covered that Frank is my pup. He's been in training for a while and is finally ready to be adopted, but he's such a good boy. I decided to keep him. So, we're a packaged deal.""

James continued to rub circles on my back as she spoke.

""Now, I met James at work a couple months ago, and we quickly became friends, and bonded over our shared love of our cute little subs at home. When James came to me concerned that he wasn't giving you everything you needed to be happy, I knew I had to help him.""

I tried to turn on his lap so I could look at him, but he held me firm and whispered for me to listen.

""I've spent the better part of the last fifteen years training pups to go live with their masters. It's been very rewarding, but most of the time lacking. I'm not sure if you saw, but my little pup isn't exactly what you would consider well endowed.

I've been fucked by my pups but, most times they were using strap ons, and it's just not the same as a good fuck, by a real man. Your D... James and I thought it might benefit us both if we were to start dating, and see if maybe we could make this a long term thing. James wanted to first ask you of your opinion, but I told him, that wouldn't be necessary. As a cuckquean you would thrive more without the choice.""

I would say I started to get nervous at this point, but I was well beyond that, I went past nervous, straight to panic.

Unbothered by the state of my emotions Irene continued. ""Pup and I will be moving in over the weekend, and you will effectively as of today start serving us both. Me as your Mistress and the pup as your beloved dog.

I'm not going to ask if you agree. I'm going to explain the rules, then we'll do a little test to be sure you're okay with everything.

She paused as James said ""This is all for your sweety, because I love you.""

First and foremost, you are not our equal. You will serve all three of us. Your fiancé as your Daddy, me as your Mistress, for now. As for the pup, you will be in charge of taking care of him. Feeding him cleaning up after him, taking punishments for him if they're of the physical variety. I'd hate to mar is skin. You will even be charged with allowing him to cum at least once week however he so chooses. This is to keep him from humping things.

Second rule- You will no longer be sleeping in our bedroom. Your Daddy will be getting the spare bedroom ready for you over the next couple of weeks. Until then you will be allowed to sleep on the dog bed with pup or in bed with us, as long as you are taking care of us.

Three- You will not only serve us inside the house, but outside of the house as well. All of the rules you are expected to follow inside you will be expected to follow through with outside.

Four- Clothing. It was so nice of you to dress up for me tonight. Unfortunately. I think you'll be wearing clothes a lot less often now. You will not be permitted to wear anything in the house unless stated otherwise. When we're leaving the house your Daddy and I will be in charge of choosing your outfits.

Five- From now on you will only be allowed to enter the bathroom with permission. Sometimes the puppy gets a little too big feeling and doesn't want to go out like a good pup. So, we'll keep the door locked, and the key on us at all times.

Six- You will also be our little human toilet/toilet paper from now on. With the exception of scat, as that is a hard pass for all of us. You will be expected to either swallow, or sit directly in front of us as we use the toilet, and then you will lick us clean.

Seven- You will be in charge of cleaning up after all three of us. Whether that be our fluids during or after sex or our general messes around the house. That will all solely be your job to take care of.

Eight- you will be granted no permissions when we have friends over, you will still be our little quean and be expected to act accordingly

Breaking any or all of these rules will result in the punishment of our choosing, and we will be allowed to add rules at any time without discussion.""

I definitely did not agree with the rules, but I knew from experience I was not allowed to speak out of turn. My mistress looked to James, and he casually started to unzip my dress before lifting it over my head.

I couldn't help it ""I thought there would be a test before we started"" I said nervously.

Mistress tsked at me. ""You've now earned your first punishment; do you know why?""

I nodded. This time I felt a full-on smack to my ass ""Use your words baby"".

""Yes mistress. I understand"" I said.

I was sitting in front of her still on James lap when he pulled out my panties at the crotch and stuck two fingers in to test my wetness. Which is when I realized I was in a lot of trouble. Of course, that's how they would test me.

James pulled his fingers from my panties and brought them up to my face before smearing them on my lip. ""Go ahead sweety. You can lick up your little mess off Daddys fingers""

I eagerly did as I was told.

Mistress laughed from the other side of the table. ""So, she agrees then?""

""She agrees.""

They talked like I wasn't even there.

""Why don't you take those dirty little panties off of her, and she can go get acquainted with the pup while we enjoy the rest of our dinner. Then afterwards we can discuss her first punishment.""

https://www.literotica.com/s/the-millers-ch-12,The Millers Ch. 12,Unknown Author,,,,,"Wow, I can't believe I lost it like that. I flat out knocked Kayla out with one open handed fist to the side of her pretty little head. I could almost picture the cartoon birdies flying around her head in a circle as she lay there out cold. I used some chloroform to keep her out. I had to act fast but in my mind I had practiced this over and over again.

Made my phone call to my accomplice and awaited his arrival. I packed her stuff as quickly as I could leaving not a sock behind. I printed up the note that Robby would find upon his return telling him that she had had enough and had left him for someone way more worthy of her love and hot body.

My stuff was also packed and loaded into my car. I didn't think that Kayla would need it anytime soon plus I missed driving my car.

My accomplice arrived and backed into the garage and I closed the door. We loaded the bitch into the trunk ensuring her hands and feet were tied and mouth secured in case she woke up. The adrenaline I felt was as if we were on one of those murder mystery shows except without the murder of course. I mean I hate her and all but that would be too much. Besides she needed to feel what I felt for the last six months.

I locked up the house, note left for Robby by her and another one left by me. Kayla's note telling him she was leaving him and not to bother trying to find her. My note letting him know that I had decided my next step as I started my new life not being a slave/submissive. I wished him well and told him I loved him.

Fast forward a month ahead. . .

Kayla woke up, head aching a bit due to hunger pangs she was still getting used to. Only five more pounds before he will let me eat she thought to herself. Why did I ever do that to her? She wondered. Her body was still getting used to her new surroundings and new diet. Pale as a ghost due to lack of sunlight, once powerful and tight body now surviving off of it's muscle for seven more days before she gets to have food again she hopes.

She looked at the wall and saw her reflection. . . she had no choice except to see her reflection as the walls were mirrored floor to ceiling. Her hair was starting to grow back, not knowing what the hell happened to her long brown locks of beautiful hair she once donned. GI Jane look was still a good one for her. She would continue to work out once she was again allowed to eat food necessary to help her with her workouts.

She was finally getting used to her new ""friends"" Carl and three other of the grandpa gang. These are her new ""handlers."" She was struggling a bit with her new surroundings though. Once having a full wardrobe with nice clothes now relegated to a fresh oversized tee shirt once a week. At least she had soap and wash clothes and toothpaste and brush to keep her somewhat dignified. The grandpa's didn't want to be fucking and getting head from a nasty skank so they made sure she had the basics.

Her holding pen was slightly more comfortable than the ones that Ciara was kept in. At least this one had a toilet and sink as well as a mattress that Kayla could reach at the end of her 12 foot chain that tethered her ankle to her ""bedroom"" prison that she would very possibly spend the next 11 months in as no one knew she was missing.

Master Carl had shown her the contract she signed although she swears she doesn't remember signing it. Only 11 more months of servitude to the Grandpa Brigade she thought to herself as she fought back the tears. ""Fuck those tears"" she had flashbacks of all the horrible things she had said or did to Ciara.

After three weeks it was starting to set in that Robby wasn't coming for her. He knew the grandpas and still didn't come to her rescue. Why didn't he come looking for her? She wondered.

Kayla was now going to find out what it is like to have no freedom. She would learn to love the grandpas as they treated Ciara pretty well. Most of them just old perverts who like to get their rocks off once in awhile.

Meanwhile on the South side of the state Robby was into his new life with his new lover. Ever since his parents had divorced he had been in close contact with his Mom and they were living together enjoying each others minds, bodies and souls. There is something about the bond between a Mother and her first born especially if it's a Son.

Ciara also found her only true love. Just as there is nothing like the love between a Mother and her Son, likewise there is equally nothing like the love between a Father and his precious Daughter. Ciara and her Father were living as lovers just as Robby and his Mommy were. Parents were both fixed so no cyclops kids would be part of this unconventional family.

Fast forward ahead five more months and Carl receives an email from an unknown address giving him the plan on how to spring Kayla from her prison without him and the gang getting caught. An eye for an eye Ciara thought to herself.

Hard lessons learned. Follow up by Ciara found out that Kayla had indeed returned to her hometown and was settling in as a college student.

Ciara and her daddy traveled the country in an RV seeing all there was to see. They became nudists and spent time at nudist resorts with like minded families who share a special kind of love for each other.

I now have an editor, so you all shouldn't need to put up with my typos and poor/dyslexic editing skills anymore.

:)

* * *

""Wait, I think I misheard you."" Ethan said to Selene as he shook his head. He and his wives had just exited the captain's cabin, and the rest of the crew were clustered around the breakfast fire eating.

""Did you just say that you wanted to bond?"" He asked with a raised eyebrow.

The caramel-haired beauty shook her head. ""Not quite, I said: 'I think we need to bond'; I don't want to at all.""

He looked at her for a long moment. ""Because of Smithbond and your impending mission to Earth?""

She nodded. ""I can't see a way around bonding because we'll need a way to communicate, but I sure as hell don't want a husband who sleeps with other women."" She said vehemently.

""It's not so bad."" Anthiel said with an amused grin, then took a sip of her drink.

""I don't care; I'm not interested."" The Brazilian woman said firmly, then looked at Ethan. ""I get that you have an issue when you're bonded to a woman but not sleeping with her. However, I think we can get around that without actually having sex.""

""Oh?"" Kendra perked up, then cocked her head to one side. ""I would've given anything to know how just yesterday, now..."" She looked at Ethan and made a thoughtful sound. ""...now I'm glad I didn't.""

Selene glanced at her, then continued. ""Anyway, I was thinking that after we bond, I can, uh... 'hold your wing' while you 'take care of yourself' while we're in different rooms. Physical contact should be enough right?""

""Um, I've never tried."" He frowned.

""Oh, I wonder if that would work."" Beth piped up. ""I volunteer to hold your wing while you try.""

""Thank you."" Selene said to the blonde, then looked back at Ethan. ""And if it works and we bond now, we should be able to communicate telepathically by the time we make it back to the portal, right?""

""Well, I think we'll arrive at the mine tomorrow, right?"" He asked Taloni.

""Yes master."" She nodded. ""Then it will take three or four days to get back to Sarah's inn when we leave, depending on the wind.""

""So four or five days total."" He said. ""And we'll probably spend at least a couple days at the mining town, so maybe a week? Longer if it takes a while to deal with the orcs."" He looked at Selene. ""Yeah, that would probably do it. I could hear Taloni faintly after about a week, and things seemed to have sped up after that.""

""I came up with similar numbers from what I remembered, that's why I suggested now."" Selene replied. ""The real question is how long it takes before your dragon side gets out of hand.""

""You said it took about a week before the dragon really got stronger, right Dominus?"" Beth said.

""About that."" He nodded.

""Then that should be perfect."" Selene said. ""And just to make it clear, I have absolutely no intention of marrying you. Ever. I simply can't stomach a man who sleeps with other women.""

He frowned. ""I never asked you to, nor did I say I wanted to marry you."" He didn't dislike Selene in the slightest, but he didn't feel much real attraction to her aside from her frankly outrageous beauty. He had a healthy respect for her, but that was about it.

""Oh."" Selene seemed to deflate slightly, but recovered quickly. ""Well, I'm glad we're on the same page then.""

""So, bonding today if I can jerk off while Beth is holding my wing."" He said with a frown. ""Wow, I thought those days were behind me.""

""No one ever held your wing while you took care of business?"" Alana winked.

""Not yet."" He chuckled. ""Though, I think I'm going to eat breakfast first.""

He sat down, and there appeared to be a bit of uncertainty about which of his wives was going to sit next to him. They usually just followed the sleeping order, but Kendra had ended up next to him in the middle of the night, changing the order.

Selene definitely noticed.

She made a face halfway between an amused smile and a grimace, rolled her eyes and shook her head slightly.

""Something you want to share with the whole class?"" He asked with an amused smile while his wives sorted themselves out, eventually settling on precedent and sitting in the order they had been sleeping in that morning.

Selene waggled her finger between him and his wives. ""Not a problem if you don't have too many women.""

""Ironically, I agree."" He sighed.

All his wives except Taloni looked at him in alarm.

""I would never get rid of any of you. Ever."" He clarified. ""But I do feel stretched thin; there's too many-- okay, not '

too many

' of you, but..."" he trailed off, not sure how to finish the sentence accurately.

""But master hasn't realized that he's a perfect husband to five women already, and refuses to acknowledge that we're all happy."" Taloni sighed and gave him a longsuffering look. ""Honestly master, please don't sell yourself short.""

Ethan felt a smile creep onto his face despite himself. ""You know, you're the sweetest thing ever. Has anyone ever told you that?""

The Fey beamed.

""To clarify, I meant that I wish I had enough time to give all of you the attention you deserve."" He said. ""Realistically, I'd never advise a man to have more than two wives;

maybe

three at the absolute maximum. I just don't feel like I give you all enough time individually.""

""We do have enough time Dominus."" Beth pointed out. ""Remember, we'll live a long time; much longer than usual.""

""True."" He conceded. ""But on the other hand, people grow and mature as they get older. I would hate not having enough time to really know you all. I mean, the harem fantasy is great... right up until it meets the real world. I'm only one man, and I only have so much time.""

""I don't remember ever complaining sir."" Alana pointed out.

""Nor I Dominus."" Beth added.

""See master, you're doing fine so far.""

""They're right my lord.""

His first four wives all looked at Kendra, who finished chewing before replying. ""Um, I've been married less than twenty four hours, so I'm probably not the best wife to ask.""

He nodded and turned to the Brazilian woman. ""Anyway, I get your point Selene; I really do. I even agree somewhat."" Ethan said, then finally took the first bite of his breakfast.

She inclined her head in confirmation, but otherwise didn't reply.

The talk around the breakfast table was a bit subdued for several minutes while Ethan and his wives ate and Selene seemed lost in though.

Finally, Rachel broke the silence. ""My lord, did you want me to write that letter to Elder Goman to let him know about my father being a dragon?""

""Good idea."" He nodded, then looked around at everyone. ""What else needs doing?""

""I need to finish Selene's strength-enhancing vambraces."" Alana said. ""I'll need some mana donations from everyone to get it finished before we arrive at the mining town though.""

""Thank you."" The Brazilian woman smiled. ""I really appreciate it.""

""My pleasure."" The wood elf replied.

""Anything else?"" Ethan asked.

""Actually yes."" Alana said. ""I was thinking about your armor, and how you carry it with that canvas backpack I made."" She made a face. ""It's kind of ugly, and I think it'll work better if I enchant the armor to stick to itself in a compact stack.""

""How do you mean?"" He asked.

""Well, I could take the backplate and stack all the smaller pieces on top of it in flat layers, and then enchant them to stick to each other so it would be one solid unit until you needed it. Then they would stop sticking to each other when you summoned them, but be compact until you do. You could then stick it to your back like the backpack, but wouldn't need to carry around that ugly old thing.""

""Oh thank Illuminar."" Beth said. ""It was

so

ugly.""

""Exactly!"" Alana exclaimed. ""This way, it'll look better and be more functional.""

""Oh! And you need to put Illuminar's sigil on the front of the breastplate!"" Taloni exclaimed as her wings vibrated in excitement. ""Then everyone will know who master is!""

""And it should go on the paldrons and back armor too!"" Beth clapped her hands together excitedly.

""Ladies, are you sure that's a good idea?"" He asked. ""That seems pretty presumptuous of me to go around wearing white armor with Illuminar's Sigil on it.""

""Not at all my lord."" Rachel interjected. ""The weapons that Gabriella

the angel

designed for you have Illuminar's sigil on them; why not the armor too?""

He opened his mouth to object, but couldn't think of a good rebuttal. Dang, Rachel was sharp.

Hmm.

Wearing white armor with Illuminar's sigil on it did seem a bit 'on the nose'. He pictured it in his head, especially the seven-pointed star with a circular center that represented Illuminar, and had to admit it would look pretty good.

He still frowned.

""What's wrong?"" Alana asked.

""I'm hesitant to walk around with Illuminar's sigil plastered all over my armor because then..."" He hesitated as he collected his thoughts. ""It's like I'm saying that I represent Illuminar and I don't feel like I'd be a very good representative.""

""Why not?"" Beth asked.

""Nearly everyone here has been around for at least one of my major screw ups."" He pointed out. ""And since I'm not perfect, I doubt I'll stop screwing up any time soon. I know I'd be pretty pissed if someone was going around claiming to represent me and screwing up as much as I do.""

""That's very wise master."" Taloni nodded. ""But I don't think you have anything to worry about. That's not what the commandment was about.""

""What commandment?"" He asked.

""Illuminar's third great commandment master."" The Fey replied. ""The Book of Light says: 'You shall not commit evil in my name, for I will not leave unpunished the man who does evil in my name.' Of course you make mistakes master, and no one expects you to be perfect. But Illuminar didn't say: 'You shall not make mistakes in my name'; He said: 'You shall not

commit evil

in my name'. You could never do that master.""

""I agree with Tee."" Beth nodded.

""Our Fey friend does have a point my lord."" Rachel conceded.

""She does."" Alana agreed.

He looked at Selene. ""Thoughts?""

""Why are you asking me?""

""Because you probably have a different perspective.""

""I do."" The Brazilian woman nodded. ""But I'm not sure you all want to hear it.""

""Well now we have to."" Beth leaned forward, and all of Ethan's other wives looked expectant as well.

""Okay, well you all say that Illuminar picked Ethan right?""

They nodded.

""And He didn't ask Ethan before picking him, right?""

They nodded again.

""Then I don't give a rat's ass what Illuminar wants if He's going around deciding what people are going to do."" She said, though without strong emotion. ""As far as I'm concerned, He can go screw Himself if He's going to toy with other people's lives and not give them a choice.""

The Brazilian woman shrugged and took another bite of her food.

Silence.

All of Ethan's wives stared at her open-mouthed. Even Anthiel and Serif seemed a bit surprised; Raklan was too busy stuffing his face to react.

""He said that I had a choice, but that He knew what I was going to choose."" Ethan said.

""Same thing."" She shrugged again.

""I'm going to pray for you."" Taloni said after several long seconds. ""Illuminar is wonderful, and I'll pray that you see that.""

""As long as He's controlling everyone, not going to happen."" The Brazilian woman replied, but she didn't seem angry about it.

* * *

""And?"" Selene asked when Ethan, Beth, and the rest of his wives emerged from the captain's cabin after breakfast. She was hoping her idea would work, little though she wanted to hold his wing while he was taking care of himself at some point in the future.

""Rachel got the letter to Elder Goman written and sent."" He said with a mischievous smile. ""And we made sure to explain about your mission to Earth too.""

""Not what I meant."" The Brazilian woman rolled her eyes. ""Did it work?""

""Did you ever eat a meal and your stomach is full, but you just don't feel satisfied?"" He replied.

""Sure.""

""It felt like that.""

""So... it worked?"" The caramel haired beauty asked.

""Yeah, it worked."" He nodded.

""So, bond?"" Selene asked, hoping that this would actually be a solution.

He took a deep breath and then let it out slowly. ""Um, we can.""

""But?"" She prompted.

He frowned. ""I don't think you realize exactly what bonding involves.""

""Moving a little mana around; I can do that now.""

""Yeah, it's more than that."" He replied. ""You still don't have any mental defenses, and before long I'll be able to feel what you're feeling. Likewise you'll be able to feel what I'm feeling.""

""Okay, then I'll create some mental defenses; problem solved.""

""It's more than that though."" He shook his head. ""I realize that neither of us grew up with it, but this bonding thing is deep. It's something that I barely understand, but it's more permanent than you might think.""

""Right, but a short death and heart restart should take care of that."" She countered.

""It does break the bond, yeah."" He conceded hesitantly. ""But also consider 'the glimpse', for lack of a better term.""

""The glimpse?"" She raised her eyebrow. ""That sounds a little melodramatic don't you think?""

""No."" He said simply, and she didn't get the sense he was exaggerating. ""Imagine that you could get a snapshot of who someone is; all of them. Every part of them, even their insecurities and the parts they hate; the parts they are ashamed of. Imagine getting that picture burned into your brain so deeply that you can never forget it. Something like that doesn't just go away, even after a short death and a heart restart.""

""That's part of the bond though, and death breaks the bond; right?"" She countered.

""Yes, but you're not listening."" He shook his head. ""They call deep mana the seat of the soul, and it took me a while to understand why, but I get it now. Frankly, it's

profoundly

intimate.""

""Profoundly?""

""Ladies."" He turned to his wives. ""Would you say it's more or less intimate than sex?""

All of them hesitated before answering, which didn't make Selene feel better. She definitely didn't want to sign up for anything near that level of intimacy. Sure he was a good guy, but doing

anything

intimate with him was the last thing she wanted, even if it wasn't sexual.

""I'm not sure I can compare them."" Alana finally said, answering Ethan's question. ""It's like food and water; both are nourishment, but they're so different that it's hard to compare them.""

Ethan's other wives mostly nodded, except for Kendra who looked pensive. ""Careful Selene."" The dragon huntress said. ""It's hard

not

to be attracted to him after bonding with him.""

The Brazilian woman frowned.

That wasn't good.

Still though, she was the only one who could go to Earth and hope to do something about Gonorran and Smithbond's portal. The last thing she wanted was a closer association with Ethan, but she was the only one who could help with that particular problem. Regardless of how she felt about it, she needed to act. No one else could and the people of the Ten Kingdoms needed her help, regardless of how she felt about it.

""Copper for your thoughts?"" Beth asked.

""Is there any way that we can deal with Smithbond and the portal without being able to communicate telepathically?"" The ex-FBI agent asked.

""I can't think of one."" Ethan replied. ""At the very least we'll need to know if you're successful.""

""He's right."" Rachel nodded. ""I hate to send you there without help, but I don't think anyone else could even make it to Earth.""

""Then we should bond."" Selene said. ""I'm not exactly looking forward to it, and I don't want to, but I don't see another way.""

""It seems like sending you alone and without backup is a colossally dumb move."" Ethan pointed out.

""But what other choice do we have?"" She countered.

""Fair."" He nodded his head in concession after several seconds. ""I don't like it, but fair.""

She took a deep breath. ""Okay, then let's do this.""

He held out his hand, and she took it. She was rather keenly aware of how smooth his scales were and how warm the man-- err, dragon himself was.

Rachel chuckled.

""What?"" Selene asked.

""Do you know how to find your deep mana yet?"" The redhead asked.

""Oh, I just assumed..."" Selene looked around to see that almost everyone had an amused expression on their faces, which made her cheeks feel warm as she accidentally displayed her ignorance of magic.

""It's easier once you've found your regular mana, but still not easy."" The teen mage said. ""Come on, I'll show you how; it shouldn't take more than a few hours.""

* * *

""Elder Goman wrote back!""

Ethan now had enough discipline that he didn't look when his youngest wife shouted from across the weather deck, no doubt burning with curiosity about its contents. Instead, he kept his eyes and senses focused on his dueling opponent. Serif gave him a small nod of approval, no doubt at his refusal to be distracted.

*Hang on angel.* He thought to everyone in response, since they had almost certainly heard the blonde shouting.

He held his sword in a low guard, which he found himself favoring because of its versatility. The attack options were a bit more limited, but it put him in an excellent position to parry and then riposte incoming attacks.

Serif attacked with a lightning fast thrust that Ethan batted aside with the lower half of his blade, simultaneously angling his own point on-line for a counter thrust. His opponent responded by using the force of Ethan's parry to accelerate his sword into a counter blow. He put his thumb on the flat of the blade, whipping it around lightning fast mostly with his wrists, forcing Ethan to abandon his thrust to deflect the attack.

Ethan stepped back after the exchange, still marveling at how incredibly proficient the man was. He didn't hold much hope of ever beating him without his enhanced reflexes

and

strength enhancing armor pieces. Even then he wasn't confident about his chances.

Serif was just that good.

Speaking of whom, the other man lowered his practice blade and inclined his head fractionally towards the beautiful blonde teen, who was none-too-patiently bouncing on the balls of her feet with a letter in her hands.

Ethan nodded and headed towards her. ""Are you excited about something?"" He asked with a wink.

She pushed the letter into his hands. ""What's it say?""

He took the letter, paused for several seconds, and then looked up at the cloudless blue sky, pausing for another several seconds before speaking. ""Wow, nice weather today.""

""Dom-i-nus."" Beth groaned, pointing insistently at the letter.

*Anyone who wants to hear the response, gather 'round.* He thought to his wives. *And Rachel, go ahead and bring Selene.*

Not long afterwards, they had assembled in front of the captain's cabin and he broke the wax seal and started reading.

""What's it say?"" Beth asked, being too short to read over his shoulder.

""It says... hmm."" He intentionally put on a very serious expression. ""It's bad. It says that a young blonde girl will soon be viciously tickled.""

Beth blinked, and then moved too slow as he dropped the letter. He managed to get both his hands around her waist and started tickling before she could react. She shrieked in laughter as she tried unsuccessfully to escape his wandering fingers.

""Gah! Dominus, please--"" She shrieked in laughter again. ""--please stop.""

He did, laughing as his youngest wife tried to catch her breath.

""Not funny Dominus!"" She said as she tried not to laugh.

""I thought it was."" He chuckled and then turned to Rachel, who had caught the letter. ""And?""",,2025-08-15T18:48:08.097019,3437,
https://www.literotica.com/s/broken-marriage-pt-01,Broken Marriage Pt. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"Who ever said married life was easy? Everyday is a battle. Different personalities, different interests, different schedules, different jobs, conflicting goals. Every marriage face these trials and tribulations. It can make or break them. Many find common ground so they can push through and continue their lives together. Others crumble under the pressure. It destroys them both. The marriage to weak to stand and they spiral down, many coming to hate the other, making divorce inevitable. Then there are the rare few. Their marriage has broken down under the pressure, yet they stay together. It is unclear what keeps these couples going. They don't talk, they don't go on dates, they don't have sex, they don't even sleep in the same bed. Their marriage is fueled on pure spite.

That was the case for Jeremy and Sasha Spencer. They were in their 10th year of their marriage. At first, everything had been like a fairy tale. They had met, funny enough, through a lawsuit. Sasha was working as a paralegal for Shermer, Morgan and Swartz who were representing Omega Financials, an investment fund that Jeremy worked at. Jeremy was a confident, slightly cocky 25 year old. He was 6 feet tall, clean shaven, well groomed and handsome. Sasha was a beautiful 23 year old young woman. She was 5 foot 5, long dirty blonde hair, in great shape and intelligent. The two had hit it off immediately and began dating. Within a few months, they were engaged and a year later, married.

It was around year 7 that the problems began to really set in. It was a culmination of several things. Sasha was bitter because she had failed the LSAT three times now. All she ever wanted was to be a lawyer. She knew she was smart, but every time she took the entrance exam, she choked. Jeremy was doing well in his career. 2 years earlier he had become a senior investment manager, which came with quite a large pay raise, but longer hours. As Jeremy succeeded and Sasha felt like she was failing, it caused a rift in their relationship. Eventually, small problems became big issues and before they knew it, their relationship was all but dead.

Sasha entered the house and threw her keys into the bowl. Her brow was furrowed in frustration. Her life was nothing but frustration anymore. She hated being at the office. She could swear that she could feel the disappointment from the partners at her inability to progress. They all had high hopes for her, the firm told her that they would pay for her schooling, yet she had let them all down time and again. Then she had to come home to her painfully unbearable husband. All they ever did was fight anymore. Half the time, they didn't even say a word to each other all night.

Sasha walked up the stairs to change out of her suit. When she reached the top, she heard a bump coming from the bedroom, then she heard the moans. She cursed to herself. Jeremy had a ""guest"" over. It really was no secret between them that he was fucking his secretary. At first he had done his best to hide it. He would rent motel rooms or go to her place, but as time went on, he stopped caring if she knew. The ironic part was that she didn't care either. She was beyond caring what he did. The reason she hadn't filed for divorce was because she liked the big house and the money. He was a resource to her, not a partner. That being said, he never fucked her in the house when Sasha was home. He knew what time she gets home from work. Apparently he didn't care anymore about that, so why should she?

She opened the door and was greeted by the sound of skin slapping against skin. Jeremy had Gina's hands cuffed to the headboard. Her legs were high in the air as Sasha's husband was balls deep inside her. Gina's eyes were closed, her face painted with an expression of pure ecstacy. Her moans were rapidly becoming screams. Her tits bounced with every thrust as Jeremy plowed into her as quickly as he could.

Neither one of them noticed Sasha standing there, watching them. She narrowed her eyes as she glared at Gina. Gina was a fresh faced 18 year old, barely out of high school. Jeremy was nearly 20 years older than her. She was quite cute, no denying that. It wasn't long ago that Jeremy had Sasha moaning that way. Really, though, the reason Sasha didn't like Gina was because Gina was threatening her lifestyle. As long as she knew her place, on her back, and didn't try to press her luck, then Sasha could put up with the arrangement.

""Jesus, Jeremy. You're fucking robbing the cradle, you know that, right?"" Sasha finally said after a minute.

Gina's eyes popped open and she gasped when she saw Sasha standing there, leaning against the door frame, arms crossed. Jeremy slowly raised his head and looked over at his wife.

""What can I say, she still has tight skin, and a tight pussy."" Jeremy retorted without breaking his rhythm, the sound of skin slapping breaking up his words.

Sasha ignored this obvious shot at her aging body and crossed the room to her closet.

""At least you have someone who can put up with your bullshit."" Sasha replied as she took off her jacket and blouse, throwing them into the dry cleaning hamper and fishing a T-shirt off the hanger. ""Gotta go young and dumb, though. A woman your age would know better.""

Jeremy rolled off Gina and lay next to her while staring down Sasha in their daily battle of wits and insults.

""More like I prefer breasts and thighs than crows feet.""

Sasha took a deep breath as she kicked her shoes off and removed her pants. Her crows feet were a new thing but he was aware of how much it bugged her. One thing about these verbal sparring matches they had was that he didn't care as much as she did. Most of what she said rolled off of him, but he knew the little comments that just cut her to her core. She turned and shot him a dirty look.

Gina's eyes darted back and forth between them. She felt quite uncomfortable, naked on the bed, exposed, vulnerable.

""Umm, maybe I should go."" She finally muttered.

""You're not going anywhere."" Jeremy snapped at her, silencing her before she could say another word. ""You are not leaving until you have drained my balls.""

""Mr. Spencer, I'm really not comfortable here."" Gina said weakly as she fiddled with the cuffs, hoping to release herself so she could cover up.

""Yeah, Mr. Spencer."" Sasha said mockingly, her hands on her hips. ""Let her go home. I'm sure her father is wondering where she is.""

Sasha could tell by how hard Gina blushed that this statement was not entirely wrong.

Jeremy shot Gina an angry look. He reached out and gave her a quick slap across the cheek that made her yelp in surprise.

""You are not going anywhere until you've finished your fucking job!"" He said aggressively, grabbing her chin and forcing her to look at him in the eyes. ""You are not in charge here, whore. You do as I tell you, understand?""

""Yes, Mr. Spencer!"" Gina blurted out nervously.

""And you!"" Jeremy said, turning and pointing at his wife. ""You don't like her being here? Well maybe if you made yourself pretty every once in a while, instead of walking around in an ugly, stained shirt, I wouldn't be bringing her by!""

""The fuck you just say to me?!"" Sasha shouted, taking a few steps towards Jeremy.

""You heard me!"" He growled back, getting off the bed. ""You walk around looking like a hobo! Ever heard of a little foundation? If can do wonders for you!""

Sasha reached out and slapped him hard across the face. They both stood in front of each other in surprise. Sasha had never hit him before. She had been tempted many times, but never had.

""I'm still a catch."" Sasha finally said, her voice trembling in anger. ""Just because you can't see it anymore doesn't mean it's not true. I'm still attractive.""

""You're a failure."" Jeremy smirked at her. ""You failed in your career and you failed in our marriage. You were once one of the prettiest women I ever met, and you failed to maintain that!""

Sasha reached out to slap him again. Jeremy was ready for this one and grabbed her wrist. He spun her around and wrapped his arm around her neck. He dragged her roughly across the room towards his bedside table while Gina screamed. He grabbed the spare set of cuffs he had there and locked her wrist into it.

""You going to hit me, bitch?"" He said angrily. ""I'll show you some manners!""

Years ago, Sasha had taken up a pole dancing class so she could perform a strip tease for Jeremy. Her husband decided to have a brass pole installed at the end of the bed so he could enjoy the show. Over the last few years, it had gone mostly unused. He forced her over to the pole and twisted her hands around it, securing the cuffs to her free wrist and trapping her in place. She pulled against the restraints but only managed to cut up her arm. Jeremy kicked her legs out and fell down, landing on her butt.

""What the fuck are you doing? Let me go!"" She yelled out furiously.

""You are not going anywhere."" Jeremy replied. He had calmed down now. He always did when he was in a position of power. ""It's about time you learned a lesson.""

He returned to the bed and unlocked Gina's cuffs. Grabbing her by her elbow, he led her back around and pushed her to her knees, just inches away from Sasha. He hooked his thumb into her mouth and pulled her jaw open, pushing his cock into her mouth. Gina tried to pull back, but he placed his hand on the back of her head and held her in place. Jeremy locked eyes with his wife as his whore slurped on the head of his dick.

""This could have been you."" He said to Sasha. ""But you pulled away. I gave you everything. Your lifestyle, a big house, a fancy car. I paid so you could get tutoring to prepare for the LSATs. I supported you when you failed, encouraged you to try again. You gave up on yourself and us.""

Sasha glared at him, hate filling her eyes. She had done her fair share of sabotage in their relationship, but he, too, held blame. When things started falling apart, he became quite nasty to her. He would humiliate and berate her over little things. For a while, sex was all they had. Within the last year, that too had stopped.

Every few seconds, Gina's eyes would quickly glance at her. She reached up and cupped his balls, playing with them. She slid her other hand up and down his shaft in unison with every head Bob. She clearly was quite experienced.

""I bet you were the whore in your high school, weren't you?"" Sasha said to her in a menacing tone. ""I bet all the boys used to use your cunt and toss you away.""

Gina stopped sucking and stared at her.

""Bet your daddy doesn't know that you ride the cock carousel. Bet he thinks you are an innocent girl, instead of a disease ridden slut!""

Gina's eyes watered a bit at these harsh words. She looked down to the floor in shame. That was the only answer Sasha needed. She could spot these dumb bitches a mile away. They all had bruised knees and rug burn on their backs. It was the only way these girls knew how to get ahead in life.

""I promise you this, Gina. I will get you back for this, you cunt. You come in my house, fuck my husband in my bed? Believe me, you will get yours.""

Gina inched away from Sasha. She was barely more than kid, used to stupid school drama. Now, she was caught in the middle of a broken marriage. A barely legal teen trapped in an adult world.

Jeremy grabbed her by her hair, causing her to wince.

""I didn't say stop!"" He barked as he jammed his cock deep into her throat. He pumped his hips into her face as she choked on his big dick. Sasha got a small feeling of satisfaction as she watched the young girl struggle to deep throat her husband. Jeremy was angry, and when he got angry, he got aggressive. Sasha was willing to bet that she wasn't used to such behavior.

Gina coughed hard as Jeremy pulled his cock from her mouth. She doubled over as she tried to catch her breath. Jeremy gave her a few seconds to collect herself before he continued to fuck her face.

Sasha hated how wet this whole situation made her. She was practically leaking out of her pants. She squeezed her knees together, hoping that Jeremy wouldn't notice.

""Fuck yeah."" Jeremy said. His cock was dripping with Gina's spit. He had turned her into a mess, her drool sliding down her chin. Her nipples glistened as the light bounced off her saliva. ""Now, time to show the dear wife how good girls get fucked.""

He sat down on the edge of the bed, signaling Gina to join him. She crawled over to the bed and climbed up beside him. He positioned her on him in reverse cowgirl, his cock probing her labia.

""Now, you look Mrs. Spencer right in the eyes. Show her what you have that she doesn't.""

Gina was clearly quite uncomfortable with the whole situation, but seemed to become more confident the longer this went on. She still did as she was told. Sasha glared at her, her stare as sharp as daggers.

Jeremy pushed himself into Gina, causing her to moan in pleasure. She began to ride him slowly, massaging his shaft with her vaginal walls. She squeezed her pussy around his cock slightly. He loved it when she did that.

""How does that cock feel?"" Jeremy whispered in her ear.

""It feels great, Mr. Spencer."" Gina replied seductively. ""I'm a lucky girl.""

""Unlike Mrs. Spencer."" He said, looking past Gina at his wife.

""Yes, sir. I don't know why she would give this up.""

Gina began to ride him faster as he began to thrust into her simultaneously. Jeremy reached around and played with her tits, knocking them around before tweaking her nipples. The stimulation made Gina more wild. She was beginning to enjoy having Sasha before her, unable to stop her while she took her husband for herself.

Jeremy was also getting off on Sasha watching him. He put his hands on Gina's shoulders and pushed her down onto him. He began pounding her violently. Gina had to hold on tight to prevent being thrown off. She started to scream as his member punched her cervix repeatedly. A mixture of pleasure and pain washed through her body. She couldn't tell whether she liked it or hated it.

""Do you like my new whore, wife?"" Jeremy sneered at her. ""She's so young, so sweet, so tight. Everything you are not.""

Jeremy lifted her up and dropped her on the ground on all fours. He knelt behind her and thrusted his cock deep inside her. He bottomed out with every stroke, smashing the hilt against her ass cheeks. He grabbed her hair and pulled her head up so she was staring Sasha right in the eyes. They were inches from each other. So close that Sasha could feel her warm breath on her face. Gina gave her a wicked smile.

""His cock feels so good."" She whispered to Sasha. ""You will never feel it again. He's mine now.""

""You are just a piece of fuck meat."" Sasha responded aggressively. ""He doesn't care about you.""

""He loves me."" Gina replied. ""Soon I'll be sleeping in your bed.""

Sasha spat directly into her eye. Gina used her fingers to wipe it off.

""Mrs. Spencer has teeth."" Jeremy chuckled to himself. He pulled Gina's body close to him. ""You better be careful with her.""

""She's just jealous because we're in love."" Gina replied, running a hand down his face.

Sasha let a small smile appear at the corners of her mouth as Jeremy remained silent.

""Do you love me, Mr. Spencer?"" Gina tried again.

""Shut up, whore."" Jeremy snapped at her as he covered her mouth with his hand. ""I'm getting close. You just focus on making me cum!""

Gina gyrated her hips around the tip of his cock, coaxing his orgasm to the surface. Jeremy began to groan as his scrotum tightened and a warm feeling spread across his body. He pulled out and stood up. Gina spun around and furiously sucked his cock while playing with his balls. Jeremy looked down at his wife, who locked eyes with him.

""You like it, don't you?"" Jeremy said in a smarmy tone. He reached out with his foot and pressed his toe against her soaking underwear. ""You like watching your husband fuck other girls?""

""No!"" Sasha's protest was proven false by her damp crotch. She didn't want to like it, but as it went on, she just kept getting more aroused.

""I don't believe you.""

Jeremy pushed Gina onto her stomach and knelt down in front of her. She kept sucking his cock as he reached down and pushed Sasha's ruined underwear aside.

""Don't you fucking dare."" She warned, giving him a serious look. In their marriage, he usually heeded that look. Not this time.

He inserted a couple fingers into her cunt and began to rub them across her G-spot. Sasha couldn't help but whimper as his violation of her body excited her. It felt amazing. She had not felt a man's fingers inside her for almost a year now. She was so caught up in how much she hated her life and her husband that she never even tried to find someone else to fill her up. Her body took control as she grinded her hips into him. It took no time for him to force an orgasm out of her. She cried out as she came hard. She couldn't remember the last time she had climaxed this hard. Juices sprayed out of her pussy, painting the side of Gina's face. She didn't even break stride.

""Yeah, that's what I thought."" Jeremy said proudly as Sasha stared at the ground. She couldn't look at him.

""Now, your turn to return the favor.""

Jeremy stood over her while Gina jerked his cock, her arm like a piston. She gave his balls a squeeze, which sent him over the edge. Jeremy yelled out in ecstasy as his seed shot out of his cock head and splashed over Sasha's forehead. The warm jizz trickled down her face. She couldn't resist as she stuck out her tongue and lick it off her lips. It was amazing how much she both hated it and loved it at the same time. She had to almost pry her eyes open as the sticky goo tried to glue her lids closed. She looked up at Jeremy from under her eyes.

For the first time in a long time, she didn't feel disdain for him like she usually did. She felt lust for him. It was a confusing feeling. However, it was also a fleeting feeling. It disappeared as soon as she saw Gina bend over and clean Jeremy's cock with her mouth.

""Well, that was fun."" Jeremy said, walking away to grab his boxers. ""Gina, did you have fun?""

""Yes, Mr. Spencer. I had a lot of fun.""

""What about you, Sasha? You have fun?""

""Fuck you, Jeremy! Take your little whore and get out!"" Sasha spat.

""Oh, I will, but only because I have to take Gina home."" Jeremy pulled his pants on and threw a shirt over his head. ""Then I'll be back. Maybe then you can have some fun with my dick.""

Gina and Jeremy grabbed their things. Gina was wearing slutty outfit that showed off a lot of leg and a lot of tit.

""I meant what I said, Gina.""

The young woman turned to her before she walked out of the room.

""I will get you back for this.""

Gina gave her a flirty smile.

""When you come looking for me, be sure to start by checking under your husband.""

Gina walked out of the room. Sasha was furious by her parting comment, cursing her silently as she left. Her husband approached her and threw the handcuff key on the ground in front of her.

""You can let yourself out. A couple years ago, I would never have done something like that to you. But lately, I see no reason I shouldn't. Remember something, you are replaceable.""

He walked out of the room without saying another word. She heard the front door slam shut and his car's engine turn over as he and Gina left. It took Sasha several minutes to unlock herself. She used her feet to drag the key behind her so she could pick it up with her hands. Once she was free, she stripped naked and headed for the shower.

As the hot water poured down her body, the image of Jeremy fucking Gina in their bed filled her mind. She let her fingers drift down to her clit. It felt so good as her fingers danced across her pussy. It only took a minute for her to rub out another orgasm. She was immediately filled with regret. She hated Gina, she hated Jeremy for what he did to her, and she hated herself for cumming to it. The tears came flowing forth. She slid down the tiled wall, sobbing as she went. She lay there for a long time, wallowing in her sorrow as she emptied the hot water tank.",,2025-08-15T18:48:13.215111,3710,

Rob got himself together and snuck down the hall to Noelle's room, knocking quietly as he read her text.

""I'm ready for you, DADDY""

Rob got hard again while standing in the hallway, his shorts lewdly tented.

Noelle opened the door, completely nude, and pulled him inside.

""Oh, Rob, it looks like you read my text."" she husked as she grabbed Rob's cock and pulled him to the bed.

Rob chuckled and asked innocently, ""How'd you know?""

Noelle used her best coquettish girl voice, putting a finger in her dimple and said, ""That big old tent in your shorts is quite a hint."" squeezing him harder.

""Now, it's time for my next lovemaking lesson. What are you going to teach me, and more importantly, show me tonight, Daddy?"" Noelle asked quietly. She felt his cock flex in her hand when she called him 'Daddy.'

Rob took a deep, calming breath and said, ""Tonight's lessons will be about your body. I want to educate you about your erogenous zones, and some of your very special places.""

Noelle giggled and squealed, ""Oooh, I can't wait!""

Rob, knowing he now had both Joan's and Jessie's pussy juices on his cock started with, ""First, we'll examine your sense of smell, and then taste. These two senses are very powerful erogenous zones, if you will.""

Rob moved off the bed and instructed Noelle, ""Ok, now sit up on the edge of the bed for me.""

She did as asked.

Rob dropped his shorts and removed his shirt, leaving only his boxers on for the moment. ""Let's start with smell."" as he moved very close to her, his crotch an inch from her face. ""I want you to close your eyes, exhale and relax, then take a deep breath.""

Noelle did exactly as instructed, and as she inhaled, smelled and felt the pungent aroma coming from Rob's groin and shorts. She sighed and smiled, eyes still shut.

""Tell me what you smell."" Rob gently instructed, his voice soft and comforting.

Noelle thought for a moment and then said, ""I smell your body, your crotch, your scent. It's very arousing.""

Rob asked quietly, ""Why is it arousing?""

Noelle paused a little longer this time. ""It's arousing because I'm smelling you -- your sweat, maybe your semen, and something else that I think....maybe....is pussy?"" with a rising, questioning tone.

Rob chuckled again. ""Good. You're not wrong. Now, take another deep breath, eyes still closed, and tell me how your body is reacting."" he instructed calmly.

Noelle exhaled, then inhaled very deeply again, holding the breath in for a long moment, then exhaled. She moaned and murmured, ""My pussy is tingling, my nipples are hardening, and I'm getting wet....wetter.""

""Good girl. Do you understand how important your sense of smell is to your arousal?""

Noelle just nodded, eyes still closed.

""Good. Now, let's see how taste enhances your arousal."" Rob quietly intoned as he carefully removed his boxers without alerting Noelle.

Rob moved close to Noelle and quietly instructed, ""Now, open your mouth for me. Stay still, just open your mouth and keep your eyes closed."" as he rubbed his fingers all around his groin, his shaft, and head of his penis.

Slowly and lovingly, Rob first placed a finger on Noelle's lower lip, rubbing gently. Then came another, and her slowly pushed both inside, rubbing his fingertips on her tongue for a bit, then slowly removed them.

""Breathe in and gently swirl your tongue around your mouth. Tell me what you smell and taste.""

Noelle swirled her tongue around while inhaling. She smiled and moaned quietly.

""I smell you again, but stronger, more earthy, and I taste you, your sweat, your cum, and Aunt Joan's pussy. All very tangy.""

Rob smiled. ""Joan's pussy? Are you sure? Could be yours, you know."" he said with a velvety tone.

Noelle giggled and said, ""I know what I taste like, and that's not me.""

""Good girl."" Rob murmured. ""What did the taste and smells do to you?""

She smiled and husked, ""Made me wetter...""

""Good girl."" Rob reinforced. ""Open your mouth again.""

She did, patiently waiting for the next new taste and smell.

Rob grabbed his now hard cock and dragged it back and forth across Noelle's waiting lips.

Immediately, Noelle knew she was tasting the head of Rob's cock. ""Mmmmm, yummy."" she cooed.

Rob pushed his cock into her mouth. ""Taste me. Take me deeper, and then think about the tastes and smells.

Noelle was anxious to take Rob's cock. She was very wound up from this slow-burn lesson and needed something more. She moved to grab his shaft but he gently pushed her hands away.

""No, just taste and smell as I feed it to you."" he quietly instructed.

Noelle complied, putting her hands to her sides, taking Rob's cock in as he fed it to her gently, slowly, lovingly.

She moaned and whimpered, desperate for him to push his cock deep in her, into her waiting throat.

Rob slowed, then stopped, and withdrew his cock from her soft, wet mouth.

Noelle moaned, ""Noooooo!""

Rob quietly asked, ""What did you taste? What did you smell? Think about it. Tell me.""

Noelle paused and gathered herself. ""I tasted your penis, then your shaft. They taste different. They smell different, too. I also tasted pussy, but it seemed different from before, maybe another woman, you bad boy? And of course I smelled all those things, but mostly, smelled you, your aroma, your sweat, maybe even some pee, and definitely your cum. And it all combined to get me really, really hot. I wanted to deepthroat your cock badly.""

Rob quietly said, ""Good girl. All in good time. We'll talk about those tastes a little later, but see how it all combines to ramp up your arousal?""

Noelle moaned, ""Ooooh, yesssss, I'm so fucking horny right now. My pussy is gushing.""

Rob cooed, ""Perfect! That will take me to another part of tonight's lessons. Scooch back on the bed and lay down. Keep your eyes closed. Spread your legs.""

Noelle sighed a happy sigh and followed Rob's instructions, anticipating what might happen next.

Rob carefully slid up the bed between Noelle's legs and began to caress them, starting at her toes, then the soles of her feet. He kissed and licked her toes, causing her to giggle and moan.

Working up each leg, Rob stopped and ran his hands ever so lightly behind Noelle's knees, then gently kissed there as well.

Noelle began to squirm.

Rob spoke quietly, ""You see how all these gentle touches are causing you to react? Tell me what you feel.""

Noelle spoke as if in a trance-like state, ""My whole body is tingling. Not just my feet or legs, but everything. My pussy, my tummy, my nipples, my face, everything. This is so erotic.""

""And I haven't even touched your sex yet."" Rob cooed.

""Mmmmm, I can't wait."" she cooed back.

Rob smiled, ""All in good time.""

From her knees, Rob worked up the insides of her thighs, fully expecting her to become more active and far more aroused.

Soft, feather-like kisses slowly up the insides of each of Noelle's thighs caused her to squirm more, more expressively, as her thighs squeezed Rob's head lightly.

Rob then moved up to begin kissing and licking Noelle's smoothly shaven mons. His gentle licks and kisses caused Noelle's legs to start to buck a bit.

""Calm down, my sweet, I promise this will get much, much better. Tell me what you're feeling?""

Noelle moaned, ""It's like my pussy is vibrating. I want to cum, need to cum!""

Rob smiled and said, ""Soon, darling.""

He continued to lick, now venturing to her labia, nipping, licking, tonguing her up and down each side. But not the clitoris.

""Ooooh, ooooh, so hot, so horny, need to cum!"" Noelle moaned and whined.

""What would you like me to do now, sweetheart?"" Rob cooed from between her thighs.

""SUCK MY CLIT AND MAKE ME CUM!"" Noelle spat through clenched teeth.

Rob chuckled, ""But you're not ready yet, I'm not done getting you ready.""

""OOOOH, I'M SOOOOO READY!"" Noelle declared.

Rob responded evenly, ""If I bring you off now, it will be an average climax. I want you to have a monumental climax. That's what I'm teaching you -- how great your orgasms can be if you are treated properly.""

All Noelle could do is moan.

Rob crept up her body, leaving her mons and kissing her tummy up to her mammoth breasts, which were heaving with Noelle's heavy breathing. He began to kiss the underboob areas of each breast, working around to the areola and nipple of each.

Noelle's moaning was becoming more insistent as Rob worshipped her breasts.

He moved around, feeling, caressing, massaging her fleshy orbs, studying her reactions to his stimuli. Her breasts, as large as they were, were incredibly sensitive everywhere.

Rob stopped and asked, ""Tell me what you feel.""

Noelle moaned and said, ""I feel my breasts getting firm, my nipples getting really hard, your breath on my breasts is fantastic! Please suckle my nipples!""

Rob smiled and said, ""Good girl. That's my plan.""

He breathed his hot breath on a hard nipple, watching her areolae prickle, then took that nipple in his mouth and latched on.

Noelle gasped and pulled his head tight to her breast. ""YESSSSSS, SUCKLE ME!"" she hissed.

Rob spent plenty of time suckling one, then the other breast, driving Noelle higher and higher into a blissful state.

""YESSSSS, YESSSSS, Please, suck harder!"" she implored.

Rob did, and then he grabbed the free nipple and began to pinch and twist.

""YESSSS, OH MY GOD, YESSSS!"" she hissed. ""HARDER!"" she begged.

Rob switched nipples, relatched, pulled, twisted, pinched, mauled, massaged, and whatever else he could do to Noelle's huge fleshy melons.

Noelle began to buck hard, gasping, shrieking, but holding Rob's head tight to her nipple. ""YESSSS, DON'T STOPPPP! UNGGG.....UNGGGHHHHH....CUMINGGGG!"" she cried.

Her orgasm, actually, her nipplegasm, tore through her body as she squirmed and spasmed through the joyful feeling. She slowly released Rob's head, although he continued to suckle her a few more moments. Then he stopped and rolled aside of her.

""Tell me what you felt, baby. What was going on in your head as you climaxed?""

Noelle, still gasping, said, ""I felt wonderful! My whole body reacted from my toes to my scalp. My mind went blank as the crush of my orgasm washed through me. My vision went bright white. It seemed to last forever! I'm so spent now.""

Rob smiled and said, ""That is what good sex is like. I took my time -- our time -- and got you so stimulated that when you crested the wave, you were higher than you'd ever been before.""

Rob paused, then asked, ""So what did you learn?""

Noelle, still winded, thought for several moments and then began, ""I need to be patient, and so does my lover. I need to guide him to all the places and to do all the things that make me feel good and get me wound up so that my climax is truly a climax.""

Rob nodded, smiling and said, ""Good girl. You learned a lot. Now, what didn't I do?""

Noelle said, ""You did everything just right. How could you not have?""

Rob chuckled and reminded Noelle, ""Well, I ignored your clitoris, and I didn't do anything with my penis.""

Noelle was shocked, ""OH MY GOD! You're right!"" Then she rolled over, grabbed Rob and hugged him long and hard, crushing her breasts against him. ""Thank you soooo much! That's such a revelation!""

Rob smiled and said, ""And this is one of the reasons I'm fascinated with your huge breasts!""

Noelle snorted and play-smacked his shoulder. ""Men!"" she huffed with mock indignance.

They laid in bed hugging each other for a while until Noelle asked, ""Ok, so whose pussy did I taste on your cock?"" with a smirk.

Rob chortled, and said, ""Well, definitely Joan's.""

Noelle gave Rob a 'Well duh' look and then a 'tell me more' look.

Rob decided to string this out a little. ""Well, how did you know about Joan?""

Noelle responded, ""Well, the first clue was when we sat down for dinner and drinks you both smell like hot sex, and then I saw your dried cum on Joan's boobs when she leaned over the table.""

Rob laughed and said, ""Ok, that's a fair conclusion to draw."" and stopped there, wanting to make Noelle ask the next questions.

""But really, I tasted other pussy on you, very distinct from Joan. C'mon, give it up.""

Rob smiled and got coy, ""Well, I don't really like to kiss and tell, you know.""

Noelle punched his arm. ""Enquiring minds want to know, plus how do I know you're still clean?"" she asked in all seriousness.

Rob knew she had a point. ""Ok, but you can't say anything. After Jessie took you here, she came back and we crossed paths. I thanked her for helping, we hugged, and then she grabbed me and hugged me hard. And I got a little hard.""

Noelle's eyes got big. ""OH MY GOD YOU DID JESSIE?""

Rob blushed and said, ""Well, we did each other. She suggested that we could help each other out, seeing that I was hard, and she was very horny. She took me to the private office up front and pulled my shorts down. She has good oral skills, like you, but she told me not to cum because she wanted me to fill her pussy.""

Noelle was still a little shocked, ""Holy shit. Well, I know she hasn't gotten any in a really long time, so I'm not worried anymore."" Then Noelle smiled lewdly and said, ""Tell me about it.""

Rob figured why not, so he went on. ""Well, she pulled my cock out of her throat, took off her jeans, and bent over a chair and asked me to pound her, so I did. After a few minutes she said, ""breed me, Daddy"" and you know what that does to me, so then I exploded inside her.""

""Did you get her off?"" Noelle asked, eyes big and nipples hard again.

Rob rolled his eyes, ""Of course. I wasn't going to get her all hot and bothered and leave her wanting after she told me she hadn't ever been laid really good. But then, I grabbed her boobs, and within a couple more minutes, she came hard again from me squeezing her nipples just right.""

""YOU GAVE HER A NIPPLEGASM, LIKE ME?"" Noelle asked breathlessly.

Rob smiled and said, ""Yeah, several actually. Apparently, she does it to herself sometimes, but liked it way more when I did it to her while my cock was still in her pussy.""

Noelle was now squirming again. ""OH MY GOD, that's so hot!""

Suddenly, she scooched down on the bed, grabbed Rob's half-hard cock and began to stroke and suck it with wild abandon.

""Whoa, babe, what are you doing?"" Rob gasped.

Noelle took Rob's cock out of her mouth for a few seconds to say, ""I'm getting you hard so you can do me like you did Jessie. I'm horny and jealous now. I need some big, thick cock deep inside me, Daddy""

Rob went fully hard instantly.

Noelle noticed and said, ""I need you to breed me, Daddy!"" knowing it would make him crazy with desire.

Rob was now at full staff, and Noelle was worshiping his cock with her lips, tongue, mouth, and hands.

Quickly, Noelle wrapped her humongous breasts around Rob's cock and began to give him the best titty fuck ever. Even his huge cock disappeared in Noelle's huge cleavage.

Rob's cock was drooling precum in a nearly continuous stream.

""Does Daddy like this? Does he like to see his cock wrapped up in my huge fleshy orbs? Daddy's cock is drooling lots and lots of pre-cum! So much natural lube between my big fucking titties, Daddy!""

Rob was going insane. ""Babe, it you don't stop, I'm going to paint your face and titties with the load you want in your pussy. Just sayin'.""

Noelle thought for a minute decided why not. She knew she could make him hard again quickly, so why not get painted, smear it around, and then get pounded.

""Ooooh, Daddy! I want you to paint my face, glaze my huge tits with your hot, sticky load. Do it, Daddy! Glaze me!"" C'mon Daddy, then I'll get you all hard again so you can breed me. Is that what you'd like, to breed me, Daddy?""

Noelle had pushed all the right buttons, beyond massaging Rob's cock with her pillowy funbags.

Rob grunted and gasped, ""I'MMMM CCCCUUUUUMMMMMIIINNNNGGG ONNN YOUR PRETTY FACE AND BOOOOOOOBBBBBSSSSSS!"" and then exploded all over Noelle.

She grabbed his cock and directed his seed all over her face and tits. He came in buckets, covering her. Her face, hair, boobs, hands were drenched in thick hot cum. Spurt after spurt, rope after rope, all over her. Noelle reveled in the bath she received.

Rob lay back, spent for the moment. He gasped to catch his breath and marveled at how Noelle was enjoying being covered in his seed.

He quickly grabbed his phone and said, ""I need more pictures of you like this. Stay there while I snap a few, ok?""

Noelle smiled and struck some poses as Rob's massive load dripped from her face to her tits and on to the bed.

Housekeeping was going to have no doubts as to what went on in this room tonight.

Rob put his phone down and she came up his body, dripping his cum on his belly and chest, then moved to kiss him, which Rob gladly accepted.

They embraced tightly, smearing the product of their lovemaking over each other.

Noelle allowed Rob to catch his breath for a few minutes before she began to get him aroused again. Slowly she stroked up and down his body, through all the sticky seed, playing with his nipples with her fingers, then licking them and sucking them as he would do to her.

Rob began to moan a bit, and his monster cock stirred at Noelle's attentions. She moved down his body, but skipped over his waking snake. She forced his legs apart and began to lick his perineum, and then around his puckered hole.

""Oh my god, Noelle, where did you learn about ass-eating?"" he grunted as he enjoyed her attentions to his backside.

Noelle smiled to herself and cooed, ""I've watched a little bit of porn in my day, so I know a bit about how sensitive your ass is, Daddy.""

Rob's cock twitched and further hardened as she continued to work his most intimate spot with her tongue.

Rob continued to gasp, ""Just remembeerrrrrr.....giiirrrrlllliiiieeee, what gooooooeeesss aroooouuuunnd.....cooommmmmeeesss aroooouuuunnnddd.""

Noelle giggled and husked, ""I'm counting on it, Daddy.""

Rob was completely recovered, his manhood standing straight up again, pre-cum drooling from the tip.

Noelle slowly stroked his magnificent shaft as she finished working on his ass. Without letting go her grip on him, Noelle twisted around and mounted his mighty rod, sinking slowly and joyously all the way to the bottom with a groan.

Rob groaned as her tight, hot love canal sheathed him. She flexed her walls around his thickness telling him she was ready.

Noelle leaned over, causing her boobs to crush against him and whispered, ""Fuck me, Daddy, breed me with your steely manhood.

Rob was unable to control his animalistic urges any longer. He thrust up hard and deep into her tunnel, causing her to yip and moan. Then, in a quick and practiced motion, Rob flipped Noelle to the mattress, he now atop her.

""Spread your legs wide, you horny little girl. Daddy is going to pound you to ecstasy. I'm going to fuck my babies into your womb and make you mine. All big, round, and milky so I can suckle you day and night, enjoying your sweet essence.""

Rob got himself together and snuck down the hall to Noelle's room, knocking quietly as he read her text.

""I'm ready for you, DADDY""

Rob got hard again while standing in the hallway, his shorts lewdly tented.

Noelle opened the door, completely nude, and pulled him inside.

""Oh, Rob, it looks like you read my text."" she husked as she grabbed Rob's cock and pulled him to the bed.

Rob chuckled and asked innocently, ""How'd you know?""

Noelle used her best coquettish girl voice, putting a finger in her dimple and said, ""That big old tent in your shorts is quite a hint."" squeezing him harder.

""Now, it's time for my next lovemaking lesson. What are you going to teach me, and more importantly, show me tonight, Daddy?"" Noelle asked quietly. She felt his cock flex in her hand when she called him 'Daddy.'

Rob took a deep, calming breath and said, ""Tonight's lessons will be about your body. I want to educate you about your erogenous zones, and some of your very special places.""

Noelle giggled and squealed, ""Oooh, I can't wait!""

Rob, knowing he now had both Joan's and Jessie's pussy juices on his cock started with, ""First, we'll examine your sense of smell, and then taste. These two senses are very powerful erogenous zones, if you will.""

Rob moved off the bed and instructed Noelle, ""Ok, now sit up on the edge of the bed for me.""

She did as asked.

Rob dropped his shorts and removed his shirt, leaving only his boxers on for the moment. ""Let's start with smell."" as he moved very close to her, his crotch an inch from her face. ""I want you to close your eyes, exhale and relax, then take a deep breath.""

She took me to the private office up front and pulled my shorts down. She has good oral skills, like you, but she told me not to cum because she wanted me to fill her pussy.""

Noelle was still a little shocked, ""Holy shit. Well, I know she hasn't gotten any in a really long time, so I'm not worried anymore."" Then Noelle smiled lewdly and said, ""Tell me about it.""

Rob figured why not, so he went on. ""Well, she pulled my cock out of her throat, took off her jeans, and bent over a chair and asked me to pound her, so I did. After a few minutes she said, ""breed me, Daddy"" and you know what that does to me, so then I exploded inside her.""

""Did you get her off?"" Noelle asked, eyes big and nipples hard again.

Rob rolled his eyes, ""Of course. I wasn't going to get her all hot and bothered and leave her wanting after she told me she hadn't ever been laid really good. But then, I grabbed her boobs, and within a couple more minutes, she came hard again from me squeezing her nipples just right.""

""YOU GAVE HER A NIPPLEGASM, LIKE ME?"" Noelle asked breathlessly.

Rob smiled and said, ""Yeah, several actually. Apparently, she does it to herself sometimes, but liked it way more when I did it to her while my cock was still in her pussy.""

Noelle was now squirming again. ""OH MY GOD, that's so hot!""

Suddenly, she scooched down on the bed, grabbed Rob's half-hard cock and began to stroke and suck it with wild abandon.

""Whoa, babe, what are you doing?"" Rob gasped.

Noelle took Rob's cock out of her mouth for a few seconds to say, ""I'm getting you hard so you can do me like you did Jessie. I'm horny and jealous now. I need some big, thick cock deep inside me, Daddy""

Rob went fully hard instantly.

Noelle noticed and said, ""I need you to breed me, Daddy!"" knowing it would make him crazy with desire.

Rob was now at full staff, and Noelle was worshiping his cock with her lips, tongue, mouth, and hands.

Quickly, Noelle wrapped her humongous breasts around Rob's cock and began to give him the best titty fuck ever. Even his huge cock disappeared in Noelle's huge cleavage.

Rob's cock was drooling precum in a nearly continuous stream.

""Does Daddy like this? Does he like to see his cock wrapped up in my huge fleshy orbs? Daddy's cock is drooling lots and lots of pre-cum! So much natural lube between my big fucking titties, Daddy!""

Rob was going insane. ""Babe, it you don't stop, I'm going to paint your face and titties with the load you want in your pussy. Just sayin'.""

Noelle thought for a minute decided why not. She knew she could make him hard again quickly, so why not get painted, smear it around, and then get pounded.

""Ooooh, Daddy! I want you to paint my face, glaze my huge tits with your hot, sticky load. Do it, Daddy! Glaze me!"" C'mon Daddy, then I'll get you all hard again so you can breed me. Is that what you'd like, to breed me, Daddy?""

Noelle had pushed all the right buttons, beyond massaging Rob's cock with her pillowy funbags.

Rob grunted and gasped, ""I'MMMM CCCCUUUUUMMMMMIIINNNNGGG ONNN YOUR PRETTY FACE AND BOOOOOOOBBBBBSSSSSS!"" and then exploded all over Noelle.

She grabbed his cock and directed his seed all over her face and tits. He came in buckets, covering her. Her face, hair, boobs, hands were drenched in thick hot cum. Spurt after spurt, rope after rope, all over her. Noelle reveled in the bath she received.

Rob lay back, spent for the moment. He gasped to catch his breath and marveled at how Noelle was enjoying being covered in his seed.

He quickly grabbed his phone and said, ""I need more pictures of you like this. Stay there while I snap a few, ok?""

Noelle smiled and struck some poses as Rob's massive load dripped from her face to her tits and on to the bed.

Housekeeping was going to have no doubts as to what went on in this room tonight.

Rob put his phone down and she came up his body, dripping his cum on his belly and chest, then moved to kiss him, which Rob gladly accepted.

They embraced tightly, smearing the product of their lovemaking over each other.

Noelle allowed Rob to catch his breath for a few minutes before she began to get him aroused again. Slowly she stroked up and down his body, through all the sticky seed, playing with his nipples with her fingers, then licking them and sucking them as he would do to her.

Rob began to moan a bit, and his monster cock stirred at Noelle's attentions. She moved down his body, but skipped over his waking snake. She forced his legs apart and began to lick his perineum, and then around his puckered hole.

""Oh my god, Noelle, where did you learn about ass-eating?"" he grunted as he enjoyed her attentions to his backside.

Noelle smiled to herself and cooed, ""I've watched a little bit of porn in my day, so I know a bit about how sensitive your ass is, Daddy.""

Rob's cock twitched and further hardened as she continued to work his most intimate spot with her tongue.

Rob continued to gasp, ""Just remembeerrrrrr.....giiirrrrlllliiiieeee, what gooooooeeesss aroooouuuunnd.....cooommmmmeeesss aroooouuuunnnddd.""

Noelle giggled and husked, ""I'm counting on it, Daddy.""

Rob was completely recovered, his manhood standing straight up again, pre-cum drooling from the tip.

Noelle slowly stroked his magnificent shaft as she finished working on his ass. Without letting go her grip on him, Noelle twisted around and mounted his mighty rod, sinking slowly and joyously all the way to the bottom with a groan.

Rob groaned as her tight, hot love canal sheathed him. She flexed her walls around his thickness telling him she was ready.

Noelle leaned over, causing her boobs to crush against him and whispered, ""Fuck me, Daddy, breed me with your steely manhood.

Rob was unable to control his animalistic urges any longer. He thrust up hard and deep into her tunnel, causing her to yip and moan. Then, in a quick and practiced motion, Rob flipped Noelle to the mattress, he now atop her.

""Spread your legs wide, you horny little girl. Daddy is going to pound you to ecstasy. I'm going to fuck my babies into your womb and make you mine. All big, round, and milky so I can suckle you day and night, enjoying your sweet essence.""

=== PAGE BREAK ===

Noelle grabbed her legs behind her knees and drew them up to her ears. ""I'm all yours, Daddy! Look how wide I'm spread for you! Look at my face, covered in your seed, suckle my cum-covered nipples like you need my milk right now.""

Rob pounded his stiff shaft into Noelle's gushing pussy, thrust after thrust after thrust. He found one of her plump nipples and sucked it deep into his mouth. He could taste his cum on it.

Noelle shrieked as Rob bit down softly on her nipple. ""Keep sucking, Daddy! Nibble, bite, kiss, suck that nipple. I've got another one over here!"" she gasped as she forced another nipple to his face.

They were in a lover's rhythm now, thrusting in concert, building towards their respective climaxes. Their dirty talk had devolved to grunting and gasping until Noelle reached a peak.

""OOOOHHHH, DADDDDDYYYY! I'MMM GONNNNAAAA CUMMMM....UUNNGGHH!""

Noelle's orgasm crashed over her like a tsunami, causing her body to spasm and her vagina to clamp down on Rob's length harder than ever.

""OOHH, YOOUU DDDIIRRRTTYY GGGIIRRRLLL! I'MMM PUMMMPPIIINNNGG MYYY SEEEEED DEEEEEEEP INNSSIIDDDEE YOOUURR PUUUSSSSYYYY!"" he screamed as his load shot up and out of his cock into Noelle's waiting womb.

Noelle could feel many ropes coating her insides as Rob convulsed again and again.

""Ooooh, Daddy, your jism is so hot and sticky deep inside me! I'm sure that all your swimmers are trying to breed me right now!"" she gasped, still playing on Rob's breeding kink.

She felt his cock pulse several more times, knowing that it was a response to her dirty talk. She was so happy to make him feel this good, and of course, she was so fully satisfied by his lovemaking prowess.

Both Rob and Noelle were spent and fell asleep, entangled in each other.

A short while later, after both had napped peacefully, Rob stirred. He found Noelle still napping, her massive chest rising and falling with her breaths. He could not help but smile as he felt his cock stir yet again as he surveyed her expansive breasts.

Rob gently reached out and began to lightly, very lightly, stroke and caress Noelle's breasts and nipples.

Noelle's nipples hardened slowly and her areolae prickled as Rob continued gentle stimulation. She stirred.

""Heya, sweetheart, you doing ok?"" he whispered in her ear.

Noelle opened her beautiful eyes and smiled. ""I'm going great, Daddy!"" she said without thinking.

She felt his cock twitch against her belly.

""Oops, didn't mean to wake the monster!"" she giggled.

Rob smiled and just kissed her gently. ""No worries, sweetie. I'm not sure he's really got anything left after you attacked me."" he said with a smirking smile.

""Attacked you? You got me all wound up with your story about railing Jessie. You would never consider leaving me in that state. I just gave you a little motivation."" she giggled and slapped his chest.

Rob smiled. ""Well, honey, it's 3:30AM. I need to go back to my room. Don't forget to set your alarm so you get home when you need to.""

They kissed a deep, passionate lover's kiss. Rob collected his clothes and shoes, pulled on his shorts and shirt, and quietly padded down the hall to his and Joan's room.

He slipped in the door quietly, dropped his clothes on the chair, and slipped under the covers, snuggling tightly against his wonderful cuckquean wife.

He knew he'd have to relate this night's wild turn of events to in the morning while she fucked him senseless. It would be wonderful.

# # #

Joan was awakened by the sun streaming through a part in the drapes and by Rob's snuggling against her, his left hand draped over her torso, brushing up against her breasts. She grasped him closer and gently guided his hand to her nipple, which began to harden.

Joan felt Rob's shaft hardening behind her, wedging between her ass cheeks as she made him play with her boobs. She took his fingers, put them in her mouth to slicken them, and then pushed his had between her legs.

Rob stirred, feeling the pressure of his cock against Joan's ass, and her hand pushing his fingers into her dampening pussy. This was his wake-up call, her telling him she wanted to hear about last night and enjoy an early morning lovemaking session.

""Morning, Babe."" he mumbled. ""You're a little handsy this morning."" he chuckled.

Joan snorted and quipped, ""Whose fingers are in my pussy and whose cock is wedged in my ass?""

Rob smiled and innocently responded, ""Well, I think you had something to do with where my hand is, and, well, that's just my morning wood making its presence known. You'd be pretty upset if I just laid her all limp and inattentitive.""

Joan giggled and said, ""Ok, you're right on all accounts. Now, about last night...""

Rob smiled and said, ""Well, it's quite a story.""

Joan rolled over and took his hardening cock to her lips. ""I'm listening. Or do I need to suck it out of you...?""

She took his cock in her mouth, and demonstrating her commitment, took him to the root in one go, and even managed to lick his nuts while she lingered.

Rob was taken aback by his wife's new-found skills. ""Holy shit!"" he gasped. ""When did you learn to do that?

Joan smiled around his cock as she withdrew. ""Well, I haven't just been sitting around her idle while you're out schooling your niece on the more subtle points of lovemaking. I've been doing some reading and, well, viewing some, let's say, instructional videos.""

She immediately deepthroated him again.

""FUCCCKKKKK, Joan! You're gonna make me cum way to soon!""

Joan kept slithering her tongue around his balls and shaft as she took him deep again and again. She paused. ""No worries, Babe, I know you have the stamina, and I have the skills to keep you coming back again and again.""

Rob gasped and smiled.

Joan then said, ""Wait a minute. I taste something different this morning. Another pussy?""

Rob gained a modicum of control and said, ""Well, you haven't really let me tell the story yet. Oh, and you've been watching porn at night without me?""

Joan took a breath and took him deep in her throat again with the goal of taking his spunk straight into her belly. She lingered, licking him, flexing her throat, and humming best she could.

Rob tapped the top of her head, ""Joan, I'm gonna blow!"" he wheezed out.

Joan did not relent, knowing all his signals precisely. She felt his balls tighten, then his hips stiffened a bit, and finally his cock grew harder. She knew his load was on the way.

Rob spasmed and grunted, ""JOAN.....UUUNNGGGGHHHH....I'M CUMMMMMIIINNNG DOWNNNNNN YOOOUUURRRR TTHHRRROOOOAATTTT!"" And he did.

Joan felt his spend scald her throat on it's way to her belly. She stayed locked on to his cock, lodging it in her throat, flexing her muscles around it, including her tongue.

She needed to breathe now, so she withdrew slowly, all the while Rob's cock was still pulsing, emptying his balls into her. Joan let his cock escape her mouth with an exaggerated pop as the last spurts of his load gently landed on her nose, lips, and cheeks.

Rob was gasping, trying to catch his breath.

Joan was calmly breathing and wiping fingers full of Rob's last few spurts from her face into her mouth.

She was grinning like the Cheshire cat as Rob finally calmed enough to talk.

""So, who's pussy other than Noelle's is on your cock, Big Boy?""

Rob began telling the story of how he got the room for Noelle and then crossed paths with Jessie and wound up satisfying her needs in the private office up front.

Joan's eyes were wide and her nipples swollen and distended as she drank in all the details of Rob's tryst with Jessie, the very pretty, buxom, eavesdropper.

She asked, ""Does she know that you're helping Noelle, as well?""

Rob said, ""No, I didn't want to do that to Noelle. Jessie is one of her friends. Noelle knows, she tasted Jessie on me too. If she wants to share with Jessie, that's her prerogative.""

""I just want to teach Noelle some of the finer points of lovemaking, and how to pick better partners. Jessie just needed the sex, although it sounds like her situation is very similar to Noelle's, she wanted the orgasms. Big time.""

""That's fair."" Joan said. ""Wait, you gave her multiple orgasms?""

Rob smirked. ""Yes. Like I said, she just stripped and bent over a chair and used the 'fuck me Daddy' magic words, so I pounded her til she cried with pleasure.""

Joan was still waiting. ""Ok, so that's one. What about the next one?""

Rob smiled again, ""So as she came down after I took her to pound town, I grabbed her big titties and began to squeeze and pinch. She went wild and screamed for more, so even though I was still balls-deep in her pussy, I gave her several nipplegasms.""

Joan whistled. ""So how does a girl who hasn't found any good partners find out she's able to have nipplegasms?"" Joan asked, but then it immediately hit her. ""Shit, she gives them to herself when she's masturbating.""

Rob nodded. ""But she did say it was much more enjoyable and satisfying when I did it to her rather than doing it herself.

Joan snorted, ""No mystery there. Ok, so what happened with Noelle?"" she asked with a glint in her eyes.

""Well, she was really primed. I left Jessie and snuck down the hall to the room Noelle is in, knocked, and she opens the door, completely nude and pulls me inside.""

Joan smiled and said, ""You mean she grabbed you by your hard cock and pulled you into her bed?""

Rob smirked, ""How did you know?""

Joan smirked back, ""I'm your cuckquean wife. I know.""

Rob related his night's activities with Noelle to Joan. ""I taught her about smell and taste and how important those senses are to arousal and climax.""

Joan nodded, ""Excellent! How did she do?""

Rob continued, ""We started with smell. I made her close her eyes and stood with my clothed crotch right near her nose, making her take deep breaths and tell me what she smelled.""

""Was she able to identify the aromas?"" Joan asked, genuinely interested. She'd begun to finger herself.

""Yes, she did. She could smell me, my cum, and someone's pussy on me, and it made her horny and wet.""

Joan closed her eyes. ""Mmmmm, tell me more."" Her fingers were now slipping inside her wet pussy.

""We moved on to taste. I rubbed my fingers on myself, then put them on her lips and in her mouth.""

Joan moaned. ""Did she suck your fingers like a cock?""

Rob smiled, ""Why would you ask that?""

Joan whispered, ""Because that's what I would do."" She reached for Rob's shaft and began to lightly stroke it.

""Yes, she did, and she identified the tastes accurately, including being able to identify two different pussy tastes on me.""

""Mmmmmmm. That's so hot! Keep going.""

""I went the next step and gently fed her my cock, wiping the head on her lips, then forcing a little into her mouth. Actually, more like she sucked it into her mouth.""

""Mmmmm, yesss, there wasn't any forcing necessary. I'll bet you had to stop her from deepthroating you.""

""Correct again. You're quite adept at predicting Noelle's actions."" Rob intoned.

""Because I'd have done the same thing if I knew that big shaft was in my face."" Joan moaned out as the pace of her stroking and fingering picked up.

""She wanted me to make her cum, but I told her being patient was the best way to the bet climax. Reluctantly, she agreed.""

""Tell me moooorrrreee, Rob."" Joan pleaded. The squelching of her fingers in her vagina was very loud now.

""I showed her some of her erogenous zones; arms, legs, knees, feet, toes, inside of the thighs, all the best places. Her squirming was exquisite and she became every more pleading in her desire to climax.""

Joan moaned, ""Oooh, this sounds exquisite. How did you bring her off?"" Joan's moaning was more plaintive now as she desperately frigged her cunt.

Rob continued, ""I worked may way up her legs to her mons and licked all around, but not in her pussy, which was dripping, and I avoided her clit.""

""Oooh, you're such a pussytease!"" Joan moaned as her pussy continued to squelch.

""Yeah, that's what she said, too. I left her pussy wanting, because I wanted her huge boobs in my hands and mouth. I mauled her, then began pinching her. She got really wound up, telling me not to stop.""

""You didn't stop, did you Rob?"" Joan's breathing was getting raspy.

Rob laughed, ""Hell no, I was having too much fun with her funbags. I grabbed a nipple between my lips and suckled like there was no tomorrow while pinching and twisting the other one. She was shrieking by this time.

Joan was enjoying the story so much that Rob had gotten hard again without any help from her.

""C'mon, big boy, give me the big finish, and then I'll finish on you."" Joan was breathing heavily now.

""I just kept up with her nipples and boobs and she had a monstrous climax. The sheets were a soggy mess."" Rob idly stroked his cock now.

""I spent almost no time on her pussy, and had to tell her as much afterwards.""

Joan paused her ministrations, as she wanted Rob to finish her. ""So, she didn't even realize you hadn't shoved your cock inside her?"" Joan was really on the edge, her shaky voice telegraphing that to Rob.

Rob smiled, knowing Joan was oh so close, ""Nope, and she was grateful for the revelation.""

Joan could wait no longer. ""Wow, so now you need to put that cock of yours deep inside me because I am fully aware that you haven't and I really need you to finish me, Daddy.""

Rob immediately positioned himself on top of Joan and impaled her with his steely shaft.

Joan hissed, ""Ooooh, YESSSSSS! Pound me HARD, DADDY!""

Rob, once again a man possessed by his own breeding kink, slammed deep into Joan's very wet, very tight pussy with unbridled passion.

""Come for me, Mommy! I know you're so close. Clamp your wonderful pussy down hard on my big fuck rod and make me seed your womb! Let's make you all big and round again!""

Rob was right, Joan was there, and his dirty talk that spoke to his kink caused Joan to fly over the crest and enjoy a huge orgasm. Wave after wave of pleasure and joy washed over her body, causing her nipples to grow and become distended.

Rob couldn't resist and sucked one of her huge nipples deep into his mouth and began to suckle while grabbing the other and pinching and twisting.

""DON'TTTT STTTOOOPPP!!! KEEEPPPPP GGOOOIINNNGGGG! SUCKLE MEEE!"" Joan screamed.

Rob kept going and quickly took Joan back to the top of Orgasm Mountain again and again as he worked her teats to her joy.

Joan experienced three or four nipplegasms and was now spent.

So was Rob.

They lay in bed, breathing hard, recovering from an outstanding morning of debauchery.

After several minutes of heavy breathing, Rob said, ""But that wasn't the end of it with Noelle.""

Joan turned to look at him and said, ""Ok, I'll bite. What happened next?""

Rob smiled, not expecting any more sex. ""Well, Noelle was so excited about what I'd taught her about her body, and how I brought her off without putting my cock in her pussy, she had to have my cock in her.""

Joan was interested now, ""Of course! Where did you put it?"" she casually asked.

""Well, actually she took it in her mouth and gave me a blowjob for the ages."" Rob said, almost nonchalantly.

Joan was getting more interested. Rob noted her nipples were swollen and dark pink now, darker than when he finished her a few minutes prior.

""Did she swallow it?"" Joan asked, smiling.

Rob smirked, ""No, she waited to the last second, then sprayed her face and tits with my load. She looks great covered in cum. I have some pictures in my phone.""

Joan reached for his phone, unlocked it, and scrolled the most recent pics. ""Wow, she took quite a big load! And you're right, she looks very sexy covered and dripping with your cum.""

""But she wasn't finished with me yet."" Rob added.

""Oh my god, Rob, what was left?"" Joan asked, incredulously.

""Well, apparently, she really wanted me in her pussy, so she slithered down my body and rimmed me, called me daddy, and asked me to breed her.""

""She knows the magic words. Did you teach her about rimming?"" Joan asked.

Rob chuckled. ""No, I asked her where she learned about it and she informed me she's watched 'a bit of porn.'""

Joan sighed, ""Well who hasn't these days. Go on and finish. I'm getting wet again.""

""Well, she climbed up on me and sunk down hard, rode me for a bit, and talked more breeding and daddy stuff, which just caused me to go nuts. I flipped her over and pounded her pussy until she screamed. I filled her up deep. I'll tell you that if she didn't have her tubes tied, she'd probably be my baby mama now."" he added as an afterthought.

That afterthought got Joan completely juiced up. ""OH MY GOD, DADDY, GET HARD AND BREED ME RIGHT NOW! MAKE ME ALL ROUND AND MILKY FOR YOU!""

Of course, Rob got hard immediately, threw Joan onto her back, and pushed deep into her now molten pussy.

""Ooooh, MOMMMMMMY! You're so hot for Daddy's sticky seed, aren't you!""

Joan grunted, ""YESSSSSS, DADDY! Put it deep inside me and give me your baby!""

They pounded each other hard for ten minutes before they climaxed at the same time, crying and gasping each other's names.

After a few moments of recovery, they heard a quiet knock at the door.

""Housekeeping.""

They both laughed uncontrollably.

Rob grabbed his shorts and a shirt and went to the door. He stank of sex.

Opening the door, he was surprised to see Jessie out there with a housekeeping cart.

Jessie giggled, ""Oh, good morning."" Then the smell of sex hit her. Her pussy dampened.

""Sorry to....interrupt. I'll come back later."" she told him, then winked and smiled lewdly.

""No worries. Give us an hour and we'll be out of the room.""

Jessie smiled, let the door close, and went to the next room, wondering if she was going to overhear more jungle sex from Noelle's aunt and uncle.

Rob returned to the bed, laughing. ""Well, we better get cleaned up. Jessie will be back in an hour to take care of the room.""

Joan chuckled. ""Well, she definitely knows we've been knocking it out. We both stink of sex. Good sex, I might add.""

Rob laughed, kissed his beautiful, naked, busty wife and said, I'll take a quick shower, then you can take your time.""

""Thanks, hon. And thanks for the great stories. I haven't felt quite this sated in a while.""

Rob chuckled as he ducked into the shower.

Joan smiled as she fell back on the bed, grasping her fleshy breast and rubbing her well-taken-care-of pussy as her stud of a husband showered.

# # #

Rob and Joan had another several days to spend in town. Rob wanted to have a little more one-on-one time with Noelle. He was getting used to have her huge breasts available to him regularly.

Unfortunately, Noelle had her kids for the next few days, so she would not be able to get together with him and Joan for food or drinks, or wild sex.

""Gees, I know it's kind of a bummer, but I gotta take care of the kids. My ex will have them on the weekend, so there's that, but the next few days aren't happening, Rob."" They spoke on the phone rather than text because it was easier.

Noelle thought a little more and smiled to herself. ""But, you know, Jessie isn't busy the next couple evenings. She's working days. And I know she'd like to get her needs taken care of, ya know?""

Rob smirked and said, ""Did you and her compare notes?""

Noelle blushed on the other end of the phone, ""Not really, but sort of. I told her we had to keep it to ourselves.""

Rob asked, ""So she knows we're doing the deed?""

Noelle giggled, ""She knows that you've given me some lessons on intimacy and helped me get in touch with my body.""

Rob laughed, ""So she knows.""

Noelle giggled again, ""Yeah, but not all the graphic details. She doesn't think we've actually fucked. Yet.""

Rob snorted. ""Yet, huh? Well, I'll feel her out and see what she's interested in the next couple of nights.""",,2025-08-15T18:48:18.441881,3495,3.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/seducing-kasey,Seducing Kasey,Unknown Author,,,,,"My wife, Donna, and I have a somewhat unique marriage. We are best friends and as I like to say, partners in crime. We live a bit of an alternative life. Some people might call us ""swingers"" or ""in the lifestyle"" but I don't really like those titles. The reality, sans titles, is simple: we both have the same taste in women.

Yep, in addition to being beautiful, smart, sexy, successful in her career, my wife is a bi-sexual cuckquean who loves to share. Even better, she loves to share ME and loves to watch me fuck. Don't ask me what I did to deserve her, but I guess I'm doing something right. Over the last few years, her desire for me to have play-dates with other women, without her there, has grown. Strangely, I'm the one holding back. I am truly in love with her and don't see the logic in risking our life together.

We share a special relationship with Kasey. Kasey is beautiful, standing at about 5'8, maybe 125 pounds, with long, black, wavy hair. And, as I knew from experience, a very sexual and sensual body. She is someone who we both adore. When she's in town, we spend time together in and out of the bedroom. As Kasey says: ""no matter who I am in a relationship with, you two are grandfathered in.""

But today was different. Other commitments had kept my wife from joining me as I picked up Kasey at the airport. My instructions were to pick her up from the airport and seduce her, solo. In truth, I was scared, nervous and very unsure of myself. As I stood at baggage claim scanning the anonymous faces, my heart raced. We'd spoke of it many times, fantasized about it, got off on the fantasy, but I never really thought we'd go through with it. I wasn't even sure I could go through with it, but now it was right in front of me. Decision time was imminent.

During our fantasies, Donna got very into it. She would have me tell her what I was going to do, how it would go. I'd ad-lib, narrating a sexual seduction, whispering details into her ear. At one point, my mind went further. ""You know, Kasey's having a tough time. As much as sex, she could use some loving. I'm not just going to fuck her; I'm going to make love to her too. Is that okay with you? Do you want me to just fuck her, or should I make love to her too?"" BOOM! Donna moaned loudly, as her climax exploded through her body. I assumed this meant yes.

At the airport, Kasey and I made eye contact and rushed to embrace, sharing a kiss that (for us) was more friendly than anything else. I squeezed her tightly, glad she was home, if only for a few weeks. I could feel the my breathing getting faster, and my stomach getting butterflies. My inner voice screamed: ""Dude, get grip on yourself. You're not in high school anymore."" But, that's exactly how I felt. Like a high school kid trying to score on prom night.

We held hands and chatted as we waited for her bags. We shared small talk and just happiness that she was home. I explained to her about Donnas prior engagement and that we had most of the afternoon to spend together until we were to meet a large group of friends later that night. Leaving the airport, we headed out to run a few errands, stopping for a few vintage bottles of wine, then to a downtown Portland condo that I have access to.

Standing on the eighth floor of the condo, and looking out of the windows over the beautiful Portland skyline, I took a deep breath and made my decision. ""In for a penny, in for a pound,"" right? Pressing myself against Kasey's back, I wrapped my arms around her. We swayed gently, her pressing her ass at me and kinda giggling.

Kissing her neck, I whispered: ""I have something to tell you."" (My heart raced)

""Yes?""

""Donna told me to bring you here and seduce you."" (Not sure I'm breathing)

""I don't know if I can do that without her here."" (queue: Wheel of Fortune's ""Bankrupt"" sound, as my heart sank)

Facing each other again, I took a deep breath and started to explain. ""Kasey, you know me. You know my relationship with Donna, and you know I'm not a liar or a cheater."" She nodded, so I continued. ""Donna and I have talked about this for a while. The idea turns her on, and I wouldn't be male if being with you didn't turn me on."" (I can't read her expression) ""Until just a minute ago, I wasn't sure I was going to go through with it.""

Moving closer, I kissed her again. Our lips parted softly, and our friendly kisses increased in both intimacy and passion. Kasey backed off a little, and I sensed conflict in her. Not wanting to push things, or jeopardize our friendship, I backed off too. Thinking quickly, I suggested that she call Donna, to hear for herself, and that we could lie down and just cuddle for a while. Kasey liked the suggestion and dialed Donna. No answer.

We removed our shirts, and snuggled up together. As we lay on the bed, in spoons, I began rubbing and tickling her back. Soft, sensual tickles. Being an engineer, I have ridiculously soft hands for a guy, and they were working their magic. Kasey began to ask questions:

""Are you sure she's ok with this?""

""What if she changes her mind?"" (my biggest worry)

""I could never have Donna angry with me."" (Me neither)

Having gotten past my fears, I was now at the point of no return. I wanted this. I wanted her, and I wanted her badly. But it had to be right, and not just mutual, but all three of us had to want it to. Laying down in bed, I began her seduction. Kissing, caressing and talking. The kisses grew longer, and slowly, her body became more and more exposed. At some point between kisses, Kasey asked me to describe how Donna and I had seen things progressing. Since Donna and I had just role-played the fantasy that morning, it was all fresh in my mind.

I began role-playing again. Only now, instead of role-playing that Donna was Kasey, I was role-playing that Kasey was Donna, who was Kasey. I crawled above her, pressing our bodies together. Staring into her eyes, I began to walk her through our fantasy, kissing her face, her neck and whispering into her ear. ""I'll start by kissing her, and caressing her with soft touches; mostly getting her used to my touch."" She moaned. ""Next, I'll slowly remove her clothes, starting with her shirt (it was already gone) and give her a soft massage and tickle her back.""

Kasey had rolled to her stomach, and as the words came out of my mouth, my hands explored her back. My hands wandered, delivering long tickles, up and down her back. ""Then, when she's comfortable, I'll unsnap her bra, smoothly, using just these 3 fingers."" (pop) Her bra, now unclasped, parted in the back revealing her full back. As I rubbed, she moaned.

She turned to face me and we began kissing. Slow, soft, sensuous kisses. Her skin felt electric against mine, and my erection was as hard and full as can be. I moved my attention to her neck, ears, and then down to her great breasts. She was moaning, and holding my head to her chest. My hands were everywhere, but gently. At some point, she asked me again: ""Are you sure Donna's OK with this?"" I nodded, but reminded her that we could stop at any time if she wasn't comfortable.

At that point, the last resistance gave way. She pulled my face to hers and reached into my pants, looked directly into my eyes and said: ""As long as she's OK with this, I want you to fuck me.""

Clothes flew, as we got naked. Our bodies melted together, and our kissing resumed. Working my way down her body, I kissed everywhere until I got between her legs. I then began teasing lips, avoiding the clit...she was grinding her hips upward, trying to get her clit to my mouth, but I avoided the contact. Eventually, I snaked a finger up inside of her and began sucking and then licking on her little nub.

It didn't take long for her body to reach its climax, and the release of pleasure was so powerful when she did. I crawled up her body and kissed her again, sharing her own juices with her. She only had 3 words for me: ""Fuck me, now!""

After rolling a condom on, I entered her and we began a slow, steady rhythm. Since this wasn't our first time together (just our first time alone), I knew some of her favorite things in bed. After a while, I began to long-stroke her. Slowly all the way in, and then slowly all the way out. Over and over. Slow, deep, long strokes. With our passion building, we tried other positions. She rode me on top, both cowgirl and reverse cowgirl. I took her from behind, doggy style. In short, we tried them all. This went on for about 90 minutes. I was drenched with sweat, aroused, but exhausted.

Eventually, I ended up back on top, with her legs behind held high by my arms, and me pistoning in and out frantically. Our eyes were locked and Kasey was talking dirty to me, telling me to fuck her. Reminding me how naughty this whole thing was. Begging for me to cum. As I got closer to my release, I pulled off the condom and rolled onto my back, stroking myself through my orgasm while she played with my balls and licked my left nipple.

Finally, at long last, Kasey lightly squeezed my balls and my cock erupted. My cum flew everywhere. My chest. My hand. Her breasts. Her face. Everywhere.

For the next hour or so, we cuddled, talked and rested. Donna would be joining us downtown that evening. That would be the moment of truth. We each showered then headed downtown. The gathering was in full swing when Donna finally arrived, bringing with her a change of clothes for me.

I walked with her out to her car, with my heart racing in my chest. Finally, I held her, kissed her and said: ""I did it. I took Kasey back to the condo and we had sex."" At first, she said nothing. My heart sank. Then a small smirk appeared on her face.

""I want to know every detail. Everything you can remember. But not now. We have a party to attend.""

Relieved, and breathing normally, I changed my shirt so we could rejoin the party, holding hands. As we walked, she asked: ""Kasey's staying with us tonight, right?""

I grinned and nodded affirmatively.

The threesome we had that night, all night, and the next morning...well, that's a story for another time.",,2025-08-15T18:48:49.098826,1870,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-happy-ending-voyeur,The Happy Ending Voyeur,Unknown Author,,,,,"I knocked on the door again. ""Steven?"" I called out to an apparently empty apartment. I couldn't help but pout. Here I was with surprise churros and my boyfriend was nowhere to be found. I tapped my foot and huffed. I didn't want to just leave them on the doorknob for him. What if someone took my delicious gift? I grasped the knob, turned it, and, surprisingly, it yielded. How irresponsible of him, I chided as I closed the door behind me, just leaving his door unlocked for any maniac to enter.

I entered his well-lit apartment. I placed the bag of churros on his kitchen table and wandered through his inner sanctum alone, quite enjoying my minor act of voyeurism. There was the couch on which we cuddled to watch movies together, my head resting on his shoulder, his arm holding me closely against him. Here was his bathroom, where he showered and presumably furiously masturbated to memories of me every morning. And here was his bedroom... I took a flying leap onto his covers and inhaled deeply, breathing in Steven's aroma.

A book I didn't recognize sat on his nightstand. I picked it up.

Consider the Fork

, its title proclaimed it to be. I glanced through a bit of it: a history of cooking. How like him, history and cooking together in one book. I felt a tinge of disappointment at not having found it for him myself. At least that strawberry slicer I had gotten for him had already been a success. My mouth watered at the thought of the icebox cake we had made together, clad only in aprons, and then eaten together wearing even less, using our bodies as plates, using our hands to feed each other and our tongues to clean each other...

Voices. I started out of my reverie. Steven was home! I decided to surprise him. I placed the book where I had found it and crept towards his bedroom door.

But there was more than one voice outside the apartment. A woman's, too. My eyes narrowed. Who was

this

bitch? As the door swung open I pulled back to avoid detection.

""-again for coming over on such short notice, Rose,"" Steven said.

""No problem,"" replied the mysterious Rose, with a slight Chinese accent. ""Thank you for carrying the table. I could have gotten that.""

""No, no, I insist."" Their voices were drawing closer to the bedroom. Where could I hide? Under the bed? No, I wanted to be able to see them. His closet? The louvered doors were perfect: I could peer through the slats. I snuck in and closed the door behind me, standing between a pair of cargo pants and a

Majora's Mask

t-shirt. With my face against the door, I had an excellent view of the room.

A moment later, the two of them walked in, Steven carrying a bulky item while Rose had only a large, cloth bag. He set it down on the carpet and as the two of them got it upright, I realized it was a massage table. I smiled. That's right, he had mentioned getting massages before. I was surprised she did house calls. I was surprised

anyone

did house calls. Hadn't people stopped doing that forever ago? She must be a pretty good masseuse.

Once the table was upright and made, Rose told Steven, ""I'll let you get undressed. Just call for me when you're ready.""

""Sure thing."" She left the room. Steven began undressing as I bit my lip. Part of me knew that I should just come out now before my situation got any more precarious, reveal myself, explain what had happened, and continue with my day. But another part of me, the part of me between my thighs that currently had its arm wrapped around my brain, cajoling it into agreement, wondered just how often I would get a chance to watch my boyfriend get a massage, to enjoy this sort of intimate scenario as a secret witness. Could I really just toss aside this serendipitous situation over a puny moral scruple or two? Wouldn't it be ungrateful to deny what the universe had so graciously granted me? And if I ever changed my mind, I could just turn away. There really wasn't any downside to continuing to watch.

My teeth tingled as I watched Steven undress, the casual way he pulled up his shirt over his broad, hairy chest. How he lowered his pants and boxers to the ground, unaware he was being watched, his cock still flaccid, a tiny thing almost hidden by his pubes, his balls hanging beneath. I had to wonder: had I ever seen it like that before? Not satiated and exhausted after emptying itself into me, but simply and innocently flaccid? No, I didn't think I had. By the time I got to it, it was already hard and erect, irresistible and impossible to deny. Seeing it like this, as something as natural and normal as his hand or ear...I bit my lip. I already felt my cunt warming, aroused by the excitement of spying on his casual nudity. I kept my eyes on that adorable member until he had laid face-down on the table and covered himself with a thin, white sheet that did nothing to hide the wonderful curve of his ass.

""I'm ready,"" he announced. I mentally agreed.

Rose entered shortly after. The table was angled so that I had an excellent side-on view of Steven. She adjusted the sheet before rubbing his body through it, her hands moving smoothly and with purpose. From their earlier conversation, they seemed familiar with each other. How many times had this other woman seen my boyfriend naked? Touched his body? Just where had her hands wandered? I took the chance to observe her.

She looked about forty, but it was clear she kept herself in good shape. Even from the closet, I could tell her arms were well-toned and muscular. She was Chinese, as I expected, which wasn't

hugely

surprising. Steven definitely had a type... Short, black hair, red lipstick, and her face had a warm plumpness to it without being fat. But what stood out most was her chest.

All I could do was look down at my own barely-there breasts in envy at the sight of her knockers. As she leaned down to massage his lower back, her full, heavy breasts rested comfortably on Steven's back. It would be impossible for him not to feel their soft pressure against him. I knew Steven

said

he preferred a petite chest, but I hadn't yet met the man who would turn down an enormous rack. Did he secretly wish I had tits like that? I felt an odd rush of exhilaration rush through me the thought of Steven looking at my chest and imagining hers instead.

Rose pulled back the sheet down to his ass, pumped some oil into her hands from a bottle at her waist, and continued, standing near his head as she massaged his shoulders and back. Her hand gripped his neck and rhythmically squeezed it, working away his stress and knots. From time to time he moaned, unable to keep quiet. She climbed onto the table and straddled his head, her crotch just inches above him. I reached a hand under my bra and started to touch myself, my nipples already hard. This other woman kept caressing his naked body, his skin shimmering with oil.

Once she had finished with his back, she moved to the side of the table and pulled the sheet off of him entirely. I had to suppress a gasp. My boyfriend lay there totally naked in front of her. And yet she seemed completely and professionally uninterested in my hunk's body. Or was she just good at hiding her lewd desires? She squirted more oil into her hands and began to massage his legs, wrapping her hands around his thighs, stroking his calves and buttocks. Her hands moved farther and farther up his thighs each time. There was no way she wasn't brushing up against his balls. ""Is this okay?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" Steven lazily sighed. ""That feels amazing."" He was enjoying it... I swallowed deeply. Maybe she was just thorough... After all, I couldn't actually see what was happening. Maybe she was avoiding his balls entirely and I was just being paranoid. But I knew she had to have a good view of them. What was she thinking? Was she desensitized? Was he just an asexual slab of meat to her? Or was she filled with lust, trying to resist the temptation to just reach between his legs and squeeze?

I watched as she repeated the same motions on his other leg. ""Turn over, please,"" she instructed. Without a word, he did so. The sheet stayed where it was, which is to say, nowhere near his nude body. Steven remained naked and exposed, his cock completely on display and, I couldn't help but notice, comfortably tumescent. I focused hard on controlling my breathing, keeping myself from panting and exposing myself, forcing myself to breathe in long, slow breaths as I caressed my breasts, rubbing my nipples.

Just how far was this masseuse going to go with my boyfriend? Was that a lascivious glance at his cock? Or just a coincidental look? I could feel the warm moistness of my panties as she stood over his head and massaged his scalp and face, such an intimate act from a professional, her fingers tracing his nose and cheeks and eyebrows. Her hands lingered on his Guevara-esque beard. ""I like your beard,"" she commented, echoing my own feelings. ""Very manly.""

""Thank you,"" he replied, smiling. Her hands rested on his cheeks for an extra moment or two before she pulled them away. Another serving of oil, and her hands were on his chest, thick with hair. She started with his pecs, her fingers on his nipples, making slow circles. Then she moved to his abdomen. She made long, patient strokes all the way down his stomach, her fingertips stopping right as they reached his dark pubic hair. I inhaled deeply, watching just how close she was coming, how his cock twitched each time she almost touched his awakening cock. Would she grasp it, stroke it, bring him to orgasm while I watched?

She reached down further than she had before, her hands on either side of his shaft. Her breasts lowered until they rested comfortably on my boyfriend's face, threatening to smother him. If her tits were telescopes, he'd be looking at Mars. I could only stare as Rose gave my Steven a sensation I never could. ""You have a very nice chest,"" Rose said.

""Thank you. So do you,"" Steven replied, with a somewhat muffled chuckle.

Too soon, she straightened herself and moved onto his arms. She sat on the table next to his head, as though she were his girlfriend instead of me. With one hand, she stroked his arms, while the other held his hand against her, his palm cupping her right breast. The bastard squeezed, clearly enjoying the sensation. He massaged her breast slowly, his pattern familiar. His cock began to rise, pulsating as it grew bigger and thicker. Rose moaned softly. ""

Steven

,"" she gently chided him, but did nothing to stop his attention. ""Do you want to see them?"" she asked.

""Yeah...""

She released his arm and stood up. I stared, eyes unblinking, as Rose removed her shirt. She reached behind her back and undid her bra, allowing it to fall to the floor, her breasts hanging free, even larger than I had first assumed, large and pendulous, her nipples brown and hard and thick. Steven's attention was fixated on them. ""Is this okay?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" he nodded.

She grinned. ""Good."" She moved to the other side of his table to massage his other arm, blocking my view of what was happening. But from her little squeaks and moans, and the way Steven's cock was now rock hard, it was obvious what was happening: my boyfriend was groping his masseuse's tits, rubbing her breasts just feet away from me as though I didn't exist.

""They're perfect,"" Steven said, his compliment filling me with a surprising lust. It stung, it cut...but I craved to hear more. I wanted to hear him lavish them with praise, to tell Rose just how much bigger and better hers were than mine. My breasts weren't big enough for him. Hers were. Her body could satisfy his urges better than mine and he was taking full advantage of her presence. It was impossible to deny. His trembling cock was proof enough of his arousal.

I reached into my panties. I couldn't believe how soaked my pussy was. I slipped a finger between my smooth, soft lips and stroked up and down, teasing my clit, stifling any moans that would reveal me and end my wonderful, private show.

Rose walked towards the end of the table. She crawled onto the table, kneeling between his thighs, one of her hands on each of them. Steven stared at her chest as she caressed his inner thighs, her hands sliding deliberately past his engorged manhood, stroking his stomach, his hips, his legs, her arms dancing around his body as she ignored his desperation entirely, her wrists accidentally brushing against his cock from time to time, as though she didn't even see it, but refusing to give him any relief. My slick fingers rubbed my clit, my hand squeezed my pebble-hard nipple as I stared entranced. How could she resist the urge to stroke him? To take him into her mouth and feel him explode between her lips?

Her hands drew close to her prize. They dived down between his thighs as Steven groaned. She was fondling something, and I had a pretty good idea of what. One hand emerged and she lightly grazed her nails against the length of this thick, girthy cock. It trembled, ready to cum. ""Is this okay?"" Rose whispered.

""Yes,"" he managed to gasp. It took me a moment to realize I had whispered the same thing. Her hand firmly grasped his shaft, slowly pumping it up and down as it glistened with oil. My fingers dove deep inside of me, penetrating my hot, wet warmth. A pleasurable heat grew inside my core as I watched Rose stroke my boyfriend's cock, as I heard him grunt and groan, as she watched him, amused at his helpless reactions.

""Your cock is very handsome. You're so big and thick. Does this feel good?"" Steven could only nod. ""Good,"" she replied. Her hand moved torturously slow. She would give him a stroke or two and then release, glide her fingertips around and up his shaft and head, then return her grip, only to repeat the process again. Steven's hands gripped the table, his hips bucking forcefully, trying to get just one moment more of a proper handjob out of Rose before she took away her hand yet again. A dewdrop of precum sparkled in the light at the very tip of his cock.

A well-known moan emerged from Steven's lips. My fingers pumped harder and faster. Rose obviously knew his body as well as I did. Maybe better. ""Are you cumming

already

?"" she teased. ""So soon? Can't you last any longer?"" He shook his head 'no.' ""Oh, alright,"" she conceded, clearly recognizing the impossibility of him lasting one more second against her. She pulled her hair back and bent down. My jaw dropped as I watched my boyfriend's cock vanish entirely between her red lips, Rose's hands on his thighs.

She moaned in delight. I could only imagine how he felt throbbing inside of her mouth. My knees went weak. I had to brace myself against the closet wall just to stay standing, to ensure I didn't miss a second of what was happening. My swollen lips were dripping wet. Pleasure was building in pressure inside of me, concentrating inside my cunt, ready to explode outwards. Steven moaned. ""I'm cumming!"" His body quivered and shook. Rose's lips stayed wrapped around his shaft and he grunted and orgasmed, his cum gushing into her mouth, unseen. How I wished that was my mouth he was exploding into, yet at the same time I knew she deserved that prize, earned through her hard work and by virtue of her superior breasts.

My body couldn't last any longer. I jammed my wrist into my mouth and bit down hard to stop myself from crying out, from screaming as I had the strongest orgasm of my life watching my boyfriend cum inside another woman's tight, warm mouth. I shivered and fell to my knees, waves of ecstasy flooding through me. My boyfriend had given another woman his orgasm, his cum, and I had just watched him as he climaxed with her, as she had found herself unable to resist him and had finally given in and given him the relief he so badly needed. My body tensed as I shivered, curled up in a ball, helpless against my body's reaction. Slowly, the intense pleasure subsided, and I had control of my body once more.

I looked back up through the slots. Rose still had his cock in her mouth, but as I watched, she raised her head, saliva linking her lips to his satiated, wilting cock. She looked down at the fruits of her labor and smirked, wiping her mouth clean with her hand. My lover's cum now sat inside her stomach. She'd carry around a part of him inside her all day long, a part of him denied to me. ""Mmmm, delicious...all finished?"" she asked Steven.

""Yeah...that was incredible, Rose,"" he gushed. ""You're amazing, as always.""

""I know,"" she replied. She looked towards the closet. My heart leapt. Had she heard me? Was she going to expose me?

But she returned her gaze to Steven. She stood up and put her top back on, finally hiding her obscenely large tits. The two of them made small talk as Steven got dressed and they folded her table back up. The two left the room. I wiped my hand off on my skirt and got myself ready to escape. Once I heard the front door open and close, I left the closet and went to the front door. I pressed my ear against it and couldn't hear anything, but I waited a few moments. I hadn't seen them when I had first arrived, so I knew her car had to be around the back of the building. I opened the door and peeked out. The coast was clear.

I stepped outside and waited, looking around for Steven. Once I saw him, I waved. He jogged towards me and gave me a kiss on the lips, his recently pleased cock pressing against me. I couldn't help but picture him releasing his load into Rose's mouth as he hugged me tightly, the hands that had so recently been fondling her tits now pressed lightly against the small of my back. ""There you are! I was wondering if you were out. What were you doing?"" I asked as nonchalantly as I could fake.

""Oh, just had to take out the trash,"" he lied as he opened the door. ""Were you waiting long?""

""No, I just got here."" We walked into the apartment. I couldn't wait to get him in the bedroom. I wanted him so badly, I craved him, I needed his next orgasm all for myself, all for me, I needed that proof that I still belonged to him.

""Sweetie?""

""Yeah?""

Steven held up the bag of churros. ""Do you know where these came from?""

https://www.literotica.com/s/a-cuckquean-wife-a-teen-girlfriend-ch-02,"A Cuckquean Wife, A Teen Girlfriend Ch. 02",Unknown Author,,,,,"The day after my first date with Cassie, I head downtown to bring Beth her lunch again-- working remotely certainly has its perks-- and am immediately gratified by the scene in the lobby. Cassie's impeccably dressed in a black wool miniskirt and a tight white sweater, the outfit finished by thigh-high white stockings topped with black silk bows and shiny, heeled Mary Janes. The three inches of smooth, tan skin between her stockings and her hemline make my mouth water. And the vulgar hickey I gave her yesterday is clearly visible on her pretty neck, without a brush of makeup to conceal it. My blood heats. The little tease is flaunting it.

She's also bent over the counter next to one of the dentists, their heads bent together as they chat. Two men, seated in the waiting area, aren't even bothering to pretend they're not staring at her. I wonder if they can see her panties from their vantage. If she's wearing any. I consider how jealous they'd be if they knew she'd had her glossy lips wrapped around my cock twelve hours ago. If they knew I'd filled that painfully desirably little pussy while she moaned 'daddy' in my ear. With my wife listening in the next room, getting wet to the sounds we'd made. I've said it before. I'm a lucky guy.

Cassie sees me and squeals, tearing away from the reception desk. She throws her arms around me, the clean, fruity scent of her hair making my head spin. ""I'm so happy to see you!""

The dentist looks distinctly displeased to have lost his conversational companion, and I want to laugh, knowing how badly all these men want to fuck her. I consider briefly if any of them have. I catch a flash of navy and beige in the far hallway. Also looking displeased, her flabby arms crossed jealously over her chest, is Beth. Her blatant attitude irks me. And so, though I know I shouldn't, I make her wait.

""I like your outfit,"" I tell Cassie, careful to keep my voice neutral.

She dimples sweetly, brushing her sweater down over the jiggling globes of her breasts. It's all I can do not to dig my hands into those supple balloons of flesh right there. ""Thanks, Mr. Ellis,"" she giggles innocently. Her sky-blue eyes dart to where Beth is slouching against the wall and her pink lips curve up in an arrogant, feline smile as she looks back to me. ""Did you have a good night last night?""

""Oh, I did,"" I chuckle.

""What did you do?"" Cassie's pushing it, but her expression is so cute, so naive, that no one around us even blinks.

""Last night was date night,"" I tell her. ""I went out to dinner, and then dancing,... and then home.""

Beth's head is cocked toward us, making sure she hears every word.

Cassie is practically glowing. ""That sounds really fun."" She skips across the room and squeezes Beth's doughy forearm as she passes her, gazing prettily up at my wife. ""I hope you guys had a really fun night."" And then she's gone, bouncing gracefully down the hall.

I sit with Beth in the break room and we eat together. ""Do you always talk with Cassie?"" She rolls her eyes. ""You know that's the receptionist I'm always telling you about.""

""I figured playing nice might make it easier on you here,"" I reply swiftly. ""Looks like it worked, too. She was just sweet to you.""

Beth laughs bitterly, half-chewed lettuce falling from her mouth to the table. ""She isn't sweet, Nick.""

I shrug. ""Makes no difference to me."" As we sit, I worry that Cassie's ruining me. I can't even look at Beth now, not really, not without comparing her with my little golden treat from last night. My phone pings. Men's Bathroom. Come Now.

""Excuse me,"" I tell Beth, patting her head as I push in my chair and leave my barely-touched meal behind me. I open the bathroom door to find Cassie sitting on the counter, swinging her sexy legs.

""Come here,"" she purrs, stretching her arms out to me. I know it's stupid, but hell-- I'd crawl over a mile of broken glass to get one kiss from the girl. She wraps herself around me, her skirt falling back to show off the panties she's wearing: raspberry-pink satin, with a little rhinestone heart across the front. Our tongues tangle and dance together and I can't help it: I reach down and rub Cassie's pussy through the silk of her undies, her arousal immediately darkening the delicate cloth. I groan. She tastes like cherry Pop Rocks. I can smell the creamy, sweet scent of her wetness.

I kneel down and pull her by her thighs across the counter, making her shriek a half-stifled giggle. I shove the crotch of her panties out of the way and bury my nose in her delicious cunt, French kissing the beautiful, silky folds of her divine sex. I nibble the softness of her outer lips and draw swirls over her swelling clit, sucking on it like she's a strawberry ice cream cone, like she's the best thing I've ever tasted... which she is. As she starts to shudder, I slide a finger the heated slickness of her tight opening, and she bucks against my hand as she dissolves in climax in front of me. I've never seen anything so beautiful. I know I should end it there. I can't end it there.

Cassie pulls her fitted sweater up over her tits and jerks her bra-- twin to those slick, rosy panties-- down so that her tits are propped up by it, explicitly on display, begging to be pinched and slapped and sucked. I can't let the perfection of that vision go. I pull out my phone and snap a photo of her, her stockinged legs spread, her panties pushed aside, her eyes warm and lusty beneath her impossibly long, dusky lashes. She smiles up at me, posing.

""Spread yourself for me, princess."" I watch in full rapture as Cassie tugs her underwear still farther out of the way and strokes her pink-nailed fingertips through her wetness for me, showing off the dripping, petal-pinkness of her inner sex. I take another picture. And then I toss my phone down, seeing in an uncaring haze that my wife is trying to call me, and I cup Cassie's radiant, ethereal face tenderly. I kiss her lips softly as I unbutton my pants and free my cock, nudging the throbbing head against her saturated slit. She wiggles her ass against the counter, moving to meet my thrusts. I stroke my fingers through her soft blonde hair as I sink into her, savoring the silken gloss of its strands, and she locks hers in mine, pulling me close. We make love like we've done it a thousand times, our bodies in perfect rhythm. I tug her nipples and squeeze her heavenly breasts. She reaches a hand down to slide gently under my balls, her pressure light and sensual and perfect. I groan.

There's a knock at the door. ""Nick? Are you in there?"" It's Beth.

I cover Cassie's mouth with my hand, but I don't stop stroking her perfect cunt with my cock. ""I'll be right out,"" I call back.

""Are you okay?""

Cassie's eyes are filled with bratty joy above my hand. Her pouty lips are trembling with her naughty giggles. Her juices shine on the swollen inches of my rod that plunge in and out of her stretching velvet entrance.

""I'm okay,"" I shout to my wife, as I bend to take Cassie's left breast in my mouth, tightening my grip over his lips as she whines in soft pleasure. I suckle at her perfect, engorged nipple as Beth's steps fade down the hallway, then move to tug the peak of her right breast between my teeth. I bite down, just a little, just enough to hurt, and a gush of sweet, girly cum waterfalls down Cassie's bare thighs, the most violent orgasm, the wildest squirt I've ever seen. It pushes me over the edge and I push Cassie back against the wall, hard, as I press my weight against her and empty my heavy balls into her begging, twitching snatch.

We're both gasping. Cassie blinks those June-blue eyes at me. ""I've never done that before,"" she whispers in tremulous awe. My cum is pooling out of her. Making a mess of the counter. The floor is wet. I run my thumb over her puffy bottom lip and softly, slowly move to kiss her. She sighs into my mouth, nearly collapsing in my arms. ""We're going to teach you to do lots of things you've never done before,"" I promise. She shudders in anticipation, her cheek pressed against my chest.

We reek of sex. Cassie's hair is a mess, mine not much better. I straighten my shirt and button my pants as Cassie steps out of her sodden panties, tucking the sopping wad into my pocket with a wicked grin. I kiss her once more on the forehead before heading back to the break room, where Beth is waiting.

""Where have you been?"" my wife scolds. ""You were gone for twenty minutes!""

I shrug, unapologetic. ""I'm not feeling well. I should head home, actually.""

""Oh... okay."" Beth sighs.

""I'll see you tonight."" Beth leans up to kiss me, and pauses at the unfamiliar taste: the floral, lush taste of Cassie's young pussy. She blinks, confused, but doesn't say anything. And then I'm on my way out the door, my fingers still tangled in Cassie's creamy panties, as they had been the whole time I'd said my goodbye to Beth.

I bury my nose in those panties as I drive home, my cock already straining in my pants again. What was this girl doing to me? I couldn't get enough of her.

I jump into the shower to freshen up and realize, as I'm washing my hair under the cool spill of the water, that tonight is Beth's weekly Bridge Night. I pop out of the tiled expanse, getting water everywhere, so I can text Cassie. Are you free tonight?

I know it's too soon, that I should play it cool, but I can't make myself care. I text her again without waiting for her response. Come to my place at 8.

My phone pings. It's a video of Cassie's beautiful lips, spitting an impressive mouthful of white froth into a mug with cartoon cats on it that I immediately recognize as my wife's. My cock jerks. Who was this girl? My phone pings again. I'll see you at 8. :)

Beth leaves the house at 7:58, and an Uber drops Cassie off in front of it exactly two minutes later. She's wearing her powder-blue and white cheer uniform, her butter-blonde hair pulled up into a high, bouncy ponytail held with a white silk ribbon. She's carrying a bottle of champagne. Her eyes light up when she sees me on the porch, and she runs and jumps into my arms, dropping the contents of her arms-- which, thankfully, don't break-- onto the lawn as she does so. Her lustrous thighs squeeze my waist as she kisses me with an eager, open mouth. I wonder if any of my neighbors are watching. If I hope they are.

I find myself laughing deeply at Cassie's exuberance, her youthful adoration. I realize I can't remember the last time I laughed like that, the last time I felt so... light. So free. Cassie licks my face like a puppy, grinding her groin against my middle. She's so unashamed in her sexuality, her expression... I love that, too. I carry her into the house, supporting her slight weight effortlessly with one arm. She's so tiny.

""Wait!"" she shrieks, giggling. ""The champagne!"" I carry her down the steps and bend to let her stretch to grab it, still held against my hip. Her every movement is so fluid, so pretty. I could have watched her all night.

Inside, I open the champagne for my little date and pour it into the crystal glasses Beth's parents gave us for our ten year anniversary. Cassie climbs up into my lap to drink it, straddling me, asking me questions about my work, my friends, my life, telling me in return about hers. She's a good storyteller and a fantastic audience, gasping and twirling her hair and exploding into fits of tinkling laughter. She's fun. She's so fun.

During our third glass of champagne, Cassie starts to gently stroke my cock. After we've finished the bottle, she climbs down off my lap, walking around the living room and surveying the set up.

""What are you doing?"" I ask, watching her.

She dimples, her perfect cheeks blushing. ""Why don't you come sit... here."" She selects for me the small, armless wooden chair that sits by the fireplace. Reading the question in my face, she flicks her skirt at me. ""Don't worry! Just come and see!"" She's slurring her words just a little. It's cute. I bound down the stairs and sit in the chair she's selected for me. She unwinds the ribbon from her hair slowly, shaking her golden curls free. The glint in her eyes is positively wicked. She fiddles with the stereo, gifting me the perfect picture of her sleek white panties stretched over her perky ass.

I don't know the song that comes on, something smooth and dark. Sexy. She tugs my arms behind my back and knees to loop her hair ribbon over my wrists, again and again, until she ties a string of tidy knots. I'm impressed. I'm aroused. I'm dumbfounded. She's smirking like the daintiest little devil to ever grace this goddamned earth.

""I thought you'd like to see me dance,"" Cassie breezes easily. ""I've got to practice, you know.""

I settle myself more comfortably against the stiff back of the chair. ""Princess,"" I tell her truthfully, ""I would love to see you dance."" She's still wearing her stockings from earlier, darling above her marshmallow-white sneakers. She smiles at me as she rolls her hips in slow, delicious circles, stretching her body sinuously. In the middle of my fucking living room.

She turns her back to me and bends over, her skirt flipping up to reveal the perfect heart of her ass. She rakes her fingernails up the inner slope of her left leg as she straightens back up, repeats the move on the other side. The stretchy satin of her cheer panties moves over her muscles like a second skin.

She stalks forward on her sure tiptoes and traces a dangerous fingertip over the line of my shoulders as she circles me with slow, deliberate steps. When she's fully behind me, she bends down and breathes a cool exhale over my neck. My skin goosebumps. My cock aches and stiffens. Her tongue traces a graceful arabesque, mimics cursive writing. Her pretty hand fists in my hair, jerks my head back. She kisses the hollow beneath my ear, nips sharply at the lobe. I groan. She hisses. Her hands run over my shoulders, down the hard lines of my chest, draping her body over me like a scarf.

And then, suddenly, she's in front of me, tugging the front of her uniform up to reveal her tanned abs, pulling her skirt low over her sexy hips. I'm drunk on her scent, on that single expanse of her seemingly airbrushed skin. She swings a delicate thigh over mine, lets her fingertips trace my inseam. She throws her second leg over my other thigh, hooking her feet around the lower bars of the chair. Her swollen breasts press against my sternum as her nails tickle the nape of my neck. She tugs my mouth open by pressing the pad of her thumb against the line of my bottom teeth, leans forward to flick her soft tongue against my upper teeth.

My next groan is a desperate rumble deep in my chest. She stays on my lap, leaning back to pull her top up over her head. She's wearing a different bra than earlier, white silk and plunging. I could get lost in her endless cleavage. It made no sense, a girl so tiny having those massive, pornstar tits. A third of her weight had to be in those breasts, in the vibrant arcs of her ass.

Cassie grinds fluidly against me, the heat of her core emanating even through the stiff cloth of my trousers. She reaches graceful fingers behind herself to unhook that pretty bra, her cleavage spilling out sexily as she bares herself for me, her nipples pointing up so perfectly. She kneels on the chair, straddling me, and brushes her peaked breasts over my lips, pulling away before I can capture them. It's torturous. It's believably hot.

Gracefully, my little cheerleader swivels around, the sweet peach of her ass grinding over my cock. She balances neatly on the balls of her feet and bends down until one hand touches the floor. That view of her ass.... I can hardly stand it. I want to sink my teeth into that sumptuous flesh, want to spank her and watch those delightful muscles ripple. I wonder if anyone has every fucked that perfect ass-- they had to have, right? Who wouldn't try?

Cassie sinks to the floor and crawls away from me slowly, her thighs sleek and tan and golden. She spreads those thighs as she rises, goddess-like, to her feet, her fingers pressing beautiful indents into those buttery curves I wanted so badly to squeeze. She drops back down and slinks toward me again, graceful as a lioness, her every move dancerly, intentional, and seductive. She slides her hands up my knees and lets her nose glide from my inner thigh to my groin, where she nuzzles the noticeable bulge of my package, dropping kisses over the hard ridge of my zipper. Then she looks up at me and smiles, her thumb skating exactly over the tip of my imprisoned dick. Holy, sapphire heavens. ""Hi, daddy,"" she whispers throatily. I could explode then and there.

Cassie drapes herself over my lap next, collapsing like a Victorian heroine, her arms behind our heads, her palms skimming through my hair. I've got a perfect view of her luxurious tits, her tight stomach, her suntanned legs. She turns her face to kiss my cheek. ""I want you to fuck me on the kitchen table,"" she whispers. I'd fuck her on the steps of the town tall. Hell. I'd fuck her in the middle of Times Square. ""Is that right?"" I tease, stealing a kiss.

She inhales deeply, grinding over my lap. Her hands are tight on my tensed thighs. ""Yes,"" she sighs, her breathing shortened. Tight. ""I want you to eat my pussy right where your wife eats her dinner.""

My arousal hits a new high, slamming through a roof I hadn't known existed. ""Untie me, and let's go.""

She sucks her bottom lip, rolling her body across my front. ""Not yet...,"" she taunts sweetly. I spend the next fifteen minutes tied to the chair while Cassie delights in tormenting me. She glides her puffed nipples over my lips. ""Suck."" She's drunk on her power and it's unimaginably cute. I play her game happily, sucking her sweet skin enthusiastically, coaxing those pale pink nubs into aching peaks. She climbs off of me to slide her panties down her legs. She looks like a slutty Barbie doll. I'm desperate for a glimpse of her pussy. She brings her panties to her face, inhales her own bouquet. ""Do you like how I smell, Mr. Ellis? Do you like how I taste?""

""I love your smell. I worship your taste."" She flits her panties across my face and I breathe them in deeply. ""Suck,"" she begs again. My mouth waters as I bite down on that sex-soaked bit of silk and drink up every drop of her. Needless to say... It's a good night.

Finally, finally, Cassie decides I've had enough. She unties me at last, clad only in the fluffy inches of her cheerleading skirt. I don't hesitate. I scoop her up and carry her to the oak table I've shared with my wife for half a decade. I position her directly in front of Beth's seat. She pulls her knees up, spreading herself for me. Her smile is so naughty. ""This is where your wife sits?"" Her fingers play over her glossy clit.

""Yes,"" I tell her. She smiles as I move to grip her ankles.

She holds out a manicured little hand. ""Not yet. I'm the boss tonight.""

I hold up my hands at her command. ""What is it you'd like?""

""Does your wife have a vibrator?"" At my nod, her grin deepens. ""Will you fetch it for me? I want to use it."" I get Beth's wand from the bedside table in the guest room, and bring it back to Cassie, who's spread like dinner over the table.

""Turn it on for me?"" she requests. I do, adjusting it to a setting I think she'll like. She shivers as the vibration strokes along her thigh, making its way to her cunt. I watch her wetness spread over it. ""I want Beth to smell me on it,"" Cassie giggles villainously. ""I want that bitch to see me and taste me and smell me on everything she touches."" I know I should stop her, should draw a boundary, but as I watch her sexy back arc off the table, I can't make myself care.

And then the creaking groan of the garage door sounds. A car door slams. Beth's home. It seems early. It must be early. And yet.

Cassie jumps off the table, the vibrator still in her hand. There's not a trace of fear on her face. Instead, she looks delightfully pleased, arrogant, conquering. And as my wife opens the door, that little slut ducks down and crawls under the long, draping cloth of the dining room table.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

The day after my first date with Cassie, I head downtown to bring Beth her lunch again-- working remotely certainly has its perks-- and am immediately gratified by the scene in the lobby. Cassie's impeccably dressed in a black wool miniskirt and a tight white sweater, the outfit finished by thigh-high white stockings topped with black silk bows and shiny, heeled Mary Janes. The three inches of smooth, tan skin between her stockings and her hemline make my mouth water. And the vulgar hickey I gave her yesterday is clearly visible on her pretty neck, without a brush of makeup to conceal it. My blood heats. The little tease is flaunting it.

She's also bent over the counter next to one of the dentists, their heads bent together as they chat. Two men, seated in the waiting area, aren't even bothering to pretend they're not staring at her. I wonder if they can see her panties from their vantage. If she's wearing any. I consider how jealous they'd be if they knew she'd had her glossy lips wrapped around my cock twelve hours ago. If they knew I'd filled that painfully desirably little pussy while she moaned 'daddy' in my ear. With my wife listening in the next room, getting wet to the sounds we'd made. I've said it before. I'm a lucky guy.

Cassie sees me and squeals, tearing away from the reception desk. She throws her arms around me, the clean, fruity scent of her hair making my head spin. ""I'm so happy to see you!""

The dentist looks distinctly displeased to have lost his conversational companion, and I want to laugh, knowing how badly all these men want to fuck her. I consider briefly if any of them have. I catch a flash of navy and beige in the far hallway. Also looking displeased, her flabby arms crossed jealously over her chest, is Beth. Her blatant attitude irks me. And so, though I know I shouldn't, I make her wait.

""I like your outfit,"" I tell Cassie, careful to keep my voice neutral.

She dimples sweetly, brushing her sweater down over the jiggling globes of her breasts. It's all I can do not to dig my hands into those supple balloons of flesh right there. ""Thanks, Mr. Ellis,"" she giggles innocently. Her sky-blue eyes dart to where Beth is slouching against the wall and her pink lips curve up in an arrogant, feline smile as she looks back to me. ""Did you have a good night last night?""

""Oh, I did,"" I chuckle.

""What did you do?"" Cassie's pushing it, but her expression is so cute, so naive, that no one around us even blinks.

""Last night was date night,"" I tell her. ""I went out to dinner, and then dancing,... and then home.""

Beth's head is cocked toward us, making sure she hears every word.

Cassie is practically glowing. ""That sounds really fun."" She skips across the room and squeezes Beth's doughy forearm as she passes her, gazing prettily up at my wife. ""I hope you guys had a really fun night."" And then she's gone, bouncing gracefully down the hall.

I sit with Beth in the break room and we eat together. ""Do you always talk with Cassie?"" She rolls her eyes. ""You know that's the receptionist I'm always telling you about.""

""I figured playing nice might make it easier on you here,"" I reply swiftly. ""Looks like it worked, too. She was just sweet to you.""

Beth laughs bitterly, half-chewed lettuce falling from her mouth to the table. ""She isn't sweet, Nick.""

I shrug. ""Makes no difference to me."" As we sit, I worry that Cassie's ruining me. I can't even look at Beth now, not really, not without comparing her with my little golden treat from last night. My phone pings. Men's Bathroom. Come Now.

""Excuse me,"" I tell Beth, patting her head as I push in my chair and leave my barely-touched meal behind me. I open the bathroom door to find Cassie sitting on the counter, swinging her sexy legs.

""Come here,"" she purrs, stretching her arms out to me. I know it's stupid, but hell-- I'd crawl over a mile of broken glass to get one kiss from the girl. She wraps herself around me, her skirt falling back to show off the panties she's wearing: raspberry-pink satin, with a little rhinestone heart across the front. Our tongues tangle and dance together and I can't help it: I reach down and rub Cassie's pussy through the silk of her undies, her arousal immediately darkening the delicate cloth. I groan. She tastes like cherry Pop Rocks. I can smell the creamy, sweet scent of her wetness.

I kneel down and pull her by her thighs across the counter, making her shriek a half-stifled giggle. I shove the crotch of her panties out of the way and bury my nose in her delicious cunt, French kissing the beautiful, silky folds of her divine sex. I nibble the softness of her outer lips and draw swirls over her swelling clit, sucking on it like she's a strawberry ice cream cone, like she's the best thing I've ever tasted... which she is. As she starts to shudder, I slide a finger the heated slickness of her tight opening, and she bucks against my hand as she dissolves in climax in front of me. I've never seen anything so beautiful. I know I should end it there. I can't end it there.

Cassie pulls her fitted sweater up over her tits and jerks her bra-- twin to those slick, rosy panties-- down so that her tits are propped up by it, explicitly on display, begging to be pinched and slapped and sucked. I can't let the perfection of that vision go. I pull out my phone and snap a photo of her, her stockinged legs spread, her panties pushed aside, her eyes warm and lusty beneath her impossibly long, dusky lashes. She smiles up at me, posing.

""Spread yourself for me, princess."" I watch in full rapture as Cassie tugs her underwear still farther out of the way and strokes her pink-nailed fingertips through her wetness for me, showing off the dripping, petal-pinkness of her inner sex. I take another picture. And then I toss my phone down, seeing in an uncaring haze that my wife is trying to call me, and I cup Cassie's radiant, ethereal face tenderly. I kiss her lips softly as I unbutton my pants and free my cock, nudging the throbbing head against her saturated slit. She wiggles her ass against the counter, moving to meet my thrusts. I stroke my fingers through her soft blonde hair as I sink into her, savoring the silken gloss of its strands, and she locks hers in mine, pulling me close. We make love like we've done it a thousand times, our bodies in perfect rhythm. I tug her nipples and squeeze her heavenly breasts. She reaches a hand down to slide gently under my balls, her pressure light and sensual and perfect. I groan.

There's a knock at the door. ""Nick? Are you in there?"" It's Beth.

I cover Cassie's mouth with my hand, but I don't stop stroking her perfect cunt with my cock. ""I'll be right out,"" I call back.

""Are you okay?""

Cassie's eyes are filled with bratty joy above my hand. Her pouty lips are trembling with her naughty giggles. Her juices shine on the swollen inches of my rod that plunge in and out of her stretching velvet entrance.

""I'm okay,"" I shout to my wife, as I bend to take Cassie's left breast in my mouth, tightening my grip over his lips as she whines in soft pleasure. I suckle at her perfect, engorged nipple as Beth's steps fade down the hallway, then move to tug the peak of her right breast between my teeth. I bite down, just a little, just enough to hurt, and a gush of sweet, girly cum waterfalls down Cassie's bare thighs, the most violent orgasm, the wildest squirt I've ever seen. It pushes me over the edge and I push Cassie back against the wall, hard, as I press my weight against her and empty my heavy balls into her begging, twitching snatch.

We're both gasping. Cassie blinks those June-blue eyes at me. ""I've never done that before,"" she whispers in tremulous awe. My cum is pooling out of her. Making a mess of the counter. The floor is wet. I run my thumb over her puffy bottom lip and softly, slowly move to kiss her. She sighs into my mouth, nearly collapsing in my arms. ""We're going to teach you to do lots of things you've never done before,"" I promise. She shudders in anticipation, her cheek pressed against my chest.

We reek of sex. Cassie's hair is a mess, mine not much better. I straighten my shirt and button my pants as Cassie steps out of her sodden panties, tucking the sopping wad into my pocket with a wicked grin. I kiss her once more on the forehead before heading back to the break room, where Beth is waiting.

""Where have you been?"" my wife scolds. ""You were gone for twenty minutes!""

I shrug, unapologetic. ""I'm not feeling well. I should head home, actually.""

""Oh... okay."" Beth sighs.

""I'll see you tonight."" Beth leans up to kiss me, and pauses at the unfamiliar taste: the floral, lush taste of Cassie's young pussy. She blinks, confused, but doesn't say anything. And then I'm on my way out the door, my fingers still tangled in Cassie's creamy panties, as they had been the whole time I'd said my goodbye to Beth.

I bury my nose in those panties as I drive home, my cock already straining in my pants again. What was this girl doing to me? I couldn't get enough of her.

Beth leaves the house at 7:58, and an Uber drops Cassie off in front of it exactly two minutes later. She's wearing her powder-blue and white cheer uniform, her butter-blonde hair pulled up into a high, bouncy ponytail held with a white silk ribbon. She's carrying a bottle of champagne. Her eyes light up when she sees me on the porch, and she runs and jumps into my arms, dropping the contents of her arms-- which, thankfully, don't break-- onto the lawn as she does so. Her lustrous thighs squeeze my waist as she kisses me with an eager, open mouth. I wonder if any of my neighbors are watching. If I hope they are.

I find myself laughing deeply at Cassie's exuberance, her youthful adoration. I realize I can't remember the last time I laughed like that, the last time I felt so... light. So free. Cassie licks my face like a puppy, grinding her groin against my middle. She's so unashamed in her sexuality, her expression... I love that, too. I carry her into the house, supporting her slight weight effortlessly with one arm. She's so tiny.

""Wait!"" she shrieks, giggling. ""The champagne!"" I carry her down the steps and bend to let her stretch to grab it, still held against my hip. Her every movement is so fluid, so pretty. I could have watched her all night.

Inside, I open the champagne for my little date and pour it into the crystal glasses Beth's parents gave us for our ten year anniversary.

Reading the question in my face, she flicks her skirt at me. ""Don't worry! Just come and see!"" She's slurring her words just a little. It's cute.

I don't know the song that comes on, something smooth and dark. Sexy. She tugs my arms behind my back and knees to loop her hair ribbon over my wrists, again and again, until she ties a string of tidy knots. I'm impressed. I'm aroused. I'm dumbfounded. She's smirking like the daintiest little devil to ever grace this goddamned earth.

""I thought you'd like to see me dance,"" Cassie breezes easily. ""I've got to practice, you know.""

I settle myself more comfortably against the stiff back of the chair. ""Princess,"" I tell her truthfully, ""I would love to see you dance."" She's still wearing her stockings from earlier, darling above her marshmallow-white sneakers. She smiles at me as she rolls her hips in slow, delicious circles, stretching her body sinuously. In the middle of my fucking living room.

She turns her back to me and bends over, her skirt flipping up to reveal the perfect heart of her ass.

After a leisurely morning of sex with Master, Gretchen and Ingrid, I went for my first run since before my wedding, a lot of wolves, Gretchen and my mother going with me. Sean tried to run with us, but he didn't last much more than a mile, so Alicia stayed with him while the rest of us continued. The hiking in the mountains had helped me stay in some sort of shape, but I could feel it. Running was something you had to maintain.

""By the way, how did your evening with Lois go?"" I asked Mom.

""She's stopped trying to steal your father. Moving to Maine kind of put the kibosh on that, but she still loves seeing me as her bitch.""

""Does that bother you?""

""Not really. It's kind of fun. You know Sue and I are both submissive, so we really don't get any Dominance from each other. It's kind of fun having a woman in charge sometimes, because it's just enough different from a man to be a bit more entertaining.""

""Do you know where granddad went on his honeymoon?""

""Europe. There was a lot of finagling to get worked out with the wolves over there, but because Gerhard's ancestry is German, they eventually worked something out. They even know your name in Europe.""

""Me?""

""Wolf Daughter is becoming very famous, even overseas,"" Mom said with a smile.

""Damn.""

Which is when my phone rang. I stopped running, Brigitte and Conor staying with me, while the rest ran on.

""Hello, Jessica Hagerty speaking."" I was panting pretty hard and didn't want to sound like a pervert.

""Jessica, this is Roxanne. Did I call at a bad time?""

""I was out on a morning run, but no, this is fine."" I started walking to stay loose.

""You remember me, right.""

""Sure, waitress at Papageorge in Mankato, husband Winston.""

""Winston and I have talked a lot about what you said, you know, some other man making me pregnant if I provide a child for infertile couples. We'd like to talk to the man we need to speak to about that. What has to happen next?""

""I attended a wedding yesterday, and the man you need to talk to was there. I don't know if he's still in town, or went home. He lives near Milwaukee. I can check and call you back.""

""Is there any chance you could be there too, since you and Sean have already done it?""

""Well, I'm not going to come to Mankato, since I'm in Rhinelander with family now, but I'm going to be flying back to Maine from Milwaukee in three days. I could arrange to meet you there. Otherwise, I can't be there.""

""Winston can't get the time off this week, but I could be there.""

""It might be best if you come without Winston for the next part, anyway. There's some information you need, that you should decide if Winston needs to know, too. It will be up to you how much to tell him.""

""What kind of information?""

""I can't tell you that without you signing non-disclosure forms. Winston will also need to sign them before you can tell him.""

""What time do we need to meet?""

""I'll get back to you. I need to talk to the gentleman anyway to find out a good time and place.""

""Thanks, Jessica.""

""You're welcome. Thanks for considering helping out. It means a lot to the infertile couples. I'll talk to you later."" I hung up.

""Bingo,"" Brigitte said. ""Another one bites the dust.""

""Don't know if she'll do it once she knows it's wolves, but Roxanne is definitely a possibility.""

As soon as I got back to the compound, I checked to see if Gregory was still there. I was in luck. Since the various alphas of all the packs so seldom got together, they were having meetings, and most of them were still there.

I asked if I could speak to Gregory and he soon came out.

""What can I do for you, Wolf Daughter?""

""I have another possible breeder for you out of Mankato. Frank and Sheila met her there a few days ago. Her situation is slightly different than some. Her husband is infertile and they are hoping to have their own child in addition to having one or more for the pack. She wants to meet the man in charge, and was hoping I'd be there too. I told her we have to fly out of Milwaukee in three days. It should be somewhere private because she doesn't know about wolves yet, and there will probably be shifting involved to prove to her that wolves exist.""

""What time do you fly out?""

""Noon, and we have to be there a couple hours before for security.""

""That's awfully early for a drive from Mankato. Would you have an objection to heading south the day before and meeting somewhere more convenient to her the day before? A senior wolf has a house in Wisconsin Dells. Closer for her than Milwaukee, and not as bad a drive for you to the Milwaukee airport, as from Rhinelander.""

""There will be nine of us traveling together, five humans and four wolves. Is the place big enough to sleep nine additional people?""

""It depends upon how close you're all willing to be.""

""We're used to three or four in a bed, even my parents, so that shouldn't be a huge problem. If necessary, the wolves can sleep in dog beds, although that's not our preference.""

""It's doable then."" He gave us the address, and suggested we meet there at two in the afternoon.

""I'll let her know.""

I told my parents and Gretchen we might be making a slight change in plans in order to speak to another breeder in Wisconsin Dells the day before we flew out of Milwaukee.

""It would be an easier drive to Milwaukee the next day. We'd have to leave here at 11 AM to get to Wisconsin Dells in time.""

""No problem, honey,"" Dad said, and Gretchen agreed.

I called Roxanne and told her she could meet us in Wisconsin Dells at two PM the day before I flew out and gave her the address.

After copying down the address, Roxanne thanked me. ""I appreciate your help, Jessica.""

""How's Winston accepting you having sex with another male to have babies?""

""He's not happy about it, but he does know I want children and we could use the money.""

""I understand. It takes a special type of man to accept his wife having sex with another male.""

""How does Sean do it?""

""He's a special man.""

******

Our time in Rhinelander was being cut short by a day, but grandfather was gone, so I wasn't missing too much. I did make an effort to see my friends again, and we met for supper, including Brenda and Brian, no Tommy, Jr. this time. I'd thought about going out on a leash and with the Lush in my pussy again, but it felt too much like trolling for other people, and I wanted to actually spend some time with my friends, instead of trying to attract another breeder. Brenda had a different bodyguard, a female this time, having replaced Mathias for Brian. She was named Felicia. Patty was still with Armon, and Conor was with us as well, so he could hang with members of his pack, and got introduced as another bodyguard.

""Who's bodyguard are you now?"" Brian asked.

""At the moment, no one's,"" Conor said. ""It's just my normal job. I live in Maine and came to Wisconsin for another reason.""

""The wedding?""

Conor got flustered, not wanting to say what the reason was.

""He was here for us,"" Martin said. ""I'm infertile and Conor gave us our first child and we wanted the second one to look similar, so instead of letting someone else help us out, we stuck with Conor.""

Brian said, ""I'm sorry.""

""It's not so bad now. It was horrible when I first found out. Melanie really wanted children, not just to adopt, but the whole experience, carrying a baby, delivering a baby. It caused quite a few problems in our marriage, to the point it might have broken up. I felt like less of a man, unable to give her something so basic. But, I managed to get over it. I started to look at it like a birth defect, like a weak heart or cleft palate - not really my fault, just the way things were, something I had to live with, and what were we going to do about it to fix it.

""Jessica suggested it might be possible for someone else to do it, and if our relationship was strong enough, we'd get through it. I'd been in love with Melinda forever, for four years before we even got married, all through high school. Conor was Jessica's bodyguard at the time, and we'd met him and liked him. He didn't live around here, which was a plus, as I wasn't sure if I wanted to see the guy who gave my wife a baby every day.

""It was tough, but I think in every measurable way, it did make our marriage stronger, because it was something we had to get through together. The second time didn't seem as bad as the first, and I'm actually quite thankful Conor was able to help us have something that means so much to both of us.

""Really, we consider him a friend at this point, although I'm still glad he lives in Maine,"" Martin laughed.

""So your wife has had sex with Conor?"" Brian asked.

""Several times, each time she was with him to get pregnant. Felt like ripping off a band aid. Didn't want to do it two or three months in a row, hoping for the best, so he spent the better part of each day while I was at work doing the deed, then he'd leave before I got home. Except the first day she was fertile was a Sunday, so I tried to busy myself with lawn work and a couple movies on TV. He managed to get the job done. She's pregnant with our second.""

""Rough,"" Brian said.

""It is a little. But Melinda and I love each other deeply, more than words can say, really, and I know Conor wouldn't do anything to hurt our marriage. He tried to make it a little businesslike, and not too personal. It's hard not to think that it is personal, just because it's sex, but I never felt he was trying to make love, just fuck a baby into her.

""In return, Melinda agreed to have babies for other infertile women, kind of pay it forward, since it's something we wanted so much, we knew other couples would appreciate a child as well. After we have this one, she has one more to give. We're using the money we get for those two as a nest egg for our two kids education.""

Brian nodded thoughtfully. ""Is infertility that big of a problem?""

I answered. ""Among a certain proportion of the population. We happen to know quite a few through the organizations we deal with. It's probably no more than it's ever been."" I wanted to change the subject a little. ""By the way, Brian, did you get lucky after the wedding?""

""As a matter of fact, I did,"" Brian said. Brenda was blushing. ""She was quite passionate later.""

""You gave her a reason to be passionate. You're not rejecting her out of hand because she's knocked up, which makes you worthy of being passionate for, so good man. Did you leave her sated?""

""I'd like to think so.""

""What about it, Brenda? Were you walking funny the next day?"" Gretchen asked.

""Just a little bowlegged,"" Brenda laughed. ""Brian isn't so big I couldn't easily wrap my legs around him.""

""Way to go, Brian,"" Gretchen said.

""Thank you, thank you very much.""

""Do you think you'd have a problem if Brenda liked to lick pussy on the side?"" Gretchen asked. ""I can see why you wouldn't want her dating other guys, but what about girls, especially if you could watch. I've always had a thing for cheerleaders, you see, and I'd love to have Brenda between my legs.""

""Don't you live in Maine now?""

""I'm not leaving until tomorrow."" Gretchen put her arm around Brenda. ""Just think, Brian. This,"" and she waved her hand up and down her body, ""with that,"" doing the same with Brenda, ""both buck naked and slurping on wet pussy. And after we get done, you could relieve yourself in Brenda again. And if you enjoy that, once I'm gone, Felicia is guarding Brenda's body now, and I know she doesn't mind mashing squishy bits together, either. What do you say, Brian? Do you want to watch the two of us together?""

""Gretchen!"" Brenda exclaimed.

""Hey, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. Come on, Brian. You want to watch two luscious ladies licking labia?""

We all laughed.

""You guys are all nuts,"" Brian said, as he laughed.

""But we get more sex than any other two people you know, sugar,"" Gretchen said. ""Just think, the sexy cheerleader licking the lesbian she tormented in high school. Sounds like just desserts, doesn't it?""

""That would be kind of hot, Brenda,"" Brian said. ""I've never seen two girls together before.""

""There you go, Brenda. Don't you want to turn your boyfriend on and walk funny again tomorrow? You could use the practice if you're going to keep your new bodyguard happy. Kiss, kiss, slurp.""

""Fine, I'll lick your pussy, but just for my new boyfriend. God, that sounds so amazing. My new boyfriend, -- Brian, you will have to give me your dick afterward. so I remember why I like it so much.""

""Not a problem.""

""Looks like I have plans for later,"" Gretchen said. ""Looks like you'll have to do without me, boys and girls.""

""You're just doing this to me because I treated you like shit in high school, aren't you?"" Brenda said.

""You're damn straight,"" Gretchen said, kissing Brenda on the cheek.

******

We had two vehicles going to Wisconsin Dells, ours and my parents, but we were riding together so when we stopped for lunch, we did some switching around. Gretchen and Ingrid rode with me the first leg, my parents the second. Conor rode in the other car both times.

""Did you watch Brian and Brenda fuck after you finished with her?"" I asked Gretchen.

""No, I just gave her a real messy face to kiss Brian with after I left,"" Gretchen laughed. ""That was fun. Brenda was so embarrassed to be doing that in front of Brian. Not like you. You're an exhibitionist. You love doing that shit in front of other people.""

""I do, I really do. I almost wanted to walk into the restaurant on Master's leash. It wouldn't have bothered me at all to do that in front of my friends. I just didn't want to end up trying to seduce some other woman into being a breeder when I wanted to spend time with my friends. Did Brian like watching?""

""Fuck yes, he was hard the whole time.""

""What's not to like?"" Sean said. ""Four tits, two pussies. It's like the old Doublemint Gum commercials. 'Double your pleasure, double your fun, with Doublemint, Doublemint, Doublemint Gum' except replace Doublemint with Doublegirl, and gum with fun.""

""That's what I like about you, Sean. You're open minded enough to let me fuck your wife, and not get bent out of shape about it,"" Gretchen said. ""If I liked dick a little more, I'd live with you permanently. If it's not too much trouble, I'm going to take Jessica's suggestion and look around for someone else to be my wife. Could I hang at your place for a week sometime and use it as a staging place for checking out the lesbian action in Portland?""

""Sure. I've got plans for the second weekend after we're back, but other than that, be my guest.""

""What plans, sir?"" I asked.

""That's for me to know, and you to find out, Pussycat.""

""Oooh, I'm juicing already, sir.""

""Let me check that out,"" Sean said, before sticking a finger up my wet hoohaw, making me gasp. ""Damn, that is wet.""

""Just for you, Master,"" I laughed.

""I doubt it. I suspect it's for everyone in the car.""

""Maybe, sir, but you're my favorite. Would you like me to suck you off?""

""I can wait.""

""Maybe I can't, sir. You felt how wet I am.""

""There isn't much room in here.""

""Don't need much. I just bend over your lap with my bottom in Gretchen's lap so she can finger me while I take care of your big, hard cock, Master.""

Which is what we ended up doing. I had fun, Master had fun, even Gretchen had fun, even if she didn't orgasm.

******

We arrived at the residence a little early. Gregory was there, with another wolf named Sven, mated to a female named Lana, who both owned the house. Sven was the hunter/tracker for the southern Wisconsin wolves, centrally located in their territory, and Lana was his top lieutenant. They both looked strong and fit, like Quinn, and I imagined most hunter, trackers did, if they had to take on other weres.

What surprised me a little, was that Peter and Lucy were both there. Turns out they'd taken the whole week after the wedding off and decided to come with Gregory to sign the breeding contract and meet some of the other wolves Lucy would be fucking as a breeder. They were headed to Gregory's compound after this. Everyone was dressed at the moment, since Roxanne was on the way. I introduced the others to Sven and Lana.

""You're Wolf Daughter,"" Lana said, ""and this is Sean, your mate? I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Sven and I are really hoping he can get a puppy out of some of the potential breeders we're getting. We'd so love to have a puppy.""

""I hope it works out for you,"" I said. ""How long have you been mated?""

""Thirty years.""

""Why no puppy before now?"" Sean asked.

""Sven didn't like seducing a female human for sex, especially while mated. It seemed dishonest to them and disrespectful to me, and we're always busy, which didn't leave a lot of time for a long seduction anyway. This paying for puppies seems so much more honest and less time consuming to us.""

""I wouldn't mind if Sven had a puppy with me,"" Lucy said. ""I'd love to give you your first puppy.""

""Thank you, Lucy. It would be marvelous if you did. Sven and I would love for you to be our surrogate. You're a beautiful young woman.""

Further discussion had to wait as we all heard a wolf howl, and Gregory said Roxanne was nearly here. Watchers outside.

We went outside to meet her just as her car drove up.

I greeted her first, since she knew me. ""Roxanne, thank you for coming. I know you remember my husband, Sean, and bodyguards, Brigitte and Alicia. This is my mother and father, Anita and Simon Huppert, my very good friend and lover, Gretchen, and her bodyguard, Ingrid. These are my in-laws of some sort or other, Peter and Lucy. Peter's sister just married a relative of mine. This is Gregory, the head of the organization that is willing to help you if you can help them, and Sven and his wife, Lana, one of the infertile couples who's hoping that you agree to be a surrogate mother for them. Why don't we go inside and talk some more?""

""Sure, thanks. I'd like that. It's hard to imagine that other people are having the same problems with conception as we are.""

As Sven and Lana escorted her inside, Gregory said softly. ""She's fertile now.""

""We'll see if she's ready to proceed now, although I suspect she'll want her own before she gives the pack one. My friends Martin and Melinda both wanted their own child first. I'll explore the topic with her.""

""You lead Wolf Daughter, we'll follow,"" Gregory said.

We had a seat and after a few minutes of fairly idle chit chat, I gave Roxanne her NDA.

""Roxanne, this is a non-disclosure agreement. You need to read this over very carefully and then sign it before we can discuss any business. It's very important you don't discuss anything you learn here today with anyone else; parents, siblings, even Winston. Winston will need to sign one as well, if you decide to tell him, but it may be you don't want him to know. That's entirely up to you. He doesn't absolutely have to know. I do know the consequences of violating the terms of the agreement are severe. One young man talked about what he'd learned and he's disappeared. I don't believe he's dead, but the federal government takes this very seriously.""

""Okay. I'm not sure why this is needed, but I won't talk about it.""

She read and signed the document and handed it back to me, and I handed it to Gregory.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

In this chapter, Roxanne is bred for a human child by the southern Wisconsin wolves, and Jessica begins married life at home, with Sean fucking his ex-girlfriend and allowing her to Dominate Jessica. This chapter contains oral, anal, lesbian and group sex, Dominance and submission, including spanking, and FFM threesomes. My thanks to JohnnyGalt and Steve150177 for editing. Enjoy.

And if you enjoy that, once I'm gone, Felicia is guarding Brenda's body now, and I know she doesn't mind mashing squishy bits together, either. What do you say, Brian? Do you want to watch the two of us together?""

""Gretchen!"" Brenda exclaimed.

""Hey, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. Come on, Brian. You want to watch two luscious ladies licking labia?""

We all laughed.

""You guys are all nuts,"" Brian said, as he laughed.

""But we get more sex than any other two people you know, sugar,"" Gretchen said. ""Just think, the sexy cheerleader licking the lesbian she tormented in high school. Sounds like just desserts, doesn't it?""

""That would be kind of hot, Brenda,"" Brian said. ""I've never seen two girls together before.""

""There you go, Brenda. Don't you want to turn your boyfriend on and walk funny again tomorrow? You could use the practice if you're going to keep your new bodyguard happy. Kiss, kiss, slurp.""

""Fine, I'll lick your pussy, but just for my new boyfriend. God, that sounds so amazing. My new boyfriend, -- Brian, you will have to give me your dick afterward. so I remember why I like it so much.""

""Not a problem.""

""Looks like I have plans for later,"" Gretchen said. ""Looks like you'll have to do without me, boys and girls.""

""You're just doing this to me because I treated you like shit in high school, aren't you?"" Brenda said.

""You're damn straight,"" Gretchen said, kissing Brenda on the cheek.

******

We had two vehicles going to Wisconsin Dells, ours and my parents, but we were riding together so when we stopped for lunch, we did some switching around. Gretchen and Ingrid rode with me the first leg, my parents the second. Conor rode in the other car both times.

""Did you watch Brian and Brenda fuck after you finished with her?"" I asked Gretchen.

""No, I just gave her a real messy face to kiss Brian with after I left,"" Gretchen laughed. ""That was fun. Brenda was so embarrassed to be doing that in front of Brian. Not like you. You're an exhibitionist. You love doing that shit in front of other people.""

""I do, I really do. I almost wanted to walk into the restaurant on Master's leash. It wouldn't have bothered me at all to do that in front of my friends. I just didn't want to end up trying to seduce some other woman into being a breeder when I wanted to spend time with my friends. Did Brian like watching?""

""Fuck yes, he was hard the whole time.""

""What's not to like?"" Sean said. ""Four tits, two pussies. It's like the old Doublemint Gum commercials. 'Double your pleasure, double your fun, with Doublemint, Doublemint, Doublemint Gum' except replace Doublemint with Doublegirl, and gum with fun.""

""That's what I like about you, Sean. You're open minded enough to let me fuck your wife, and not get bent out of shape about it,"" Gretchen said. ""If I liked dick a little more, I'd live with you permanently. If it's not too much trouble, I'm going to take Jessica's suggestion and look around for someone else to be my wife. Could I hang at your place for a week sometime and use it as a staging place for checking out the lesbian action in Portland?""

""Sure. I've got plans for the second weekend after we're back, but other than that, be my guest.""

""What plans, sir?"" I asked.

""That's for me to know, and you to find out, Pussycat.""

""Oooh, I'm juicing already, sir.""

""Let me check that out,"" Sean said, before sticking a finger up my wet hoohaw, making me gasp. ""Damn, that is wet.""

""Just for you, Master,"" I laughed.

""I doubt it. I suspect it's for everyone in the car.""

""Maybe, sir, but you're my favorite. Would you like me to suck you off?""

""I can wait.""

""Maybe I can't, sir. You felt how wet I am.""

""There isn't much room in here.""

""Don't need much. I just bend over your lap with my bottom in Gretchen's lap so she can finger me while I take care of your big, hard cock, Master.""

Which is what we ended up doing. I had fun, Master had fun, even Gretchen had fun, even if she didn't orgasm.

******

We arrived at the residence a little early. Gregory was there, with another wolf named Sven, mated to a female named Lana, who both owned the house. Sven was the hunter/tracker for the southern Wisconsin wolves, centrally located in their territory, and Lana was his top lieutenant. They both looked strong and fit, like Quinn, and I imagined most hunter, trackers did, if they had to take on other weres.

What surprised me a little, was that Peter and Lucy were both there. Turns out they'd taken the whole week after the wedding off and decided to come with Gregory to sign the breeding contract and meet some of the other wolves Lucy would be fucking as a breeder. They were headed to Gregory's compound after this. Everyone was dressed at the moment, since Roxanne was on the way. I introduced the others to Sven and Lana.

""You're Wolf Daughter,"" Lana said, ""and this is Sean, your mate? I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Sven and I are really hoping he can get a puppy out of some of the potential breeders we're getting. We'd so love to have a puppy.""

""I hope it works out for you,"" I said. ""How long have you been mated?""

""Thirty years.""

""Why no puppy before now?"" Sean asked.

""Sven didn't like seducing a female human for sex, especially while mated. It seemed dishonest to them and disrespectful to me, and we're always busy, which didn't leave a lot of time for a long seduction anyway. This paying for puppies seems so much more honest and less time consuming to us.""

""I wouldn't mind if Sven had a puppy with me,"" Lucy said. ""I'd love to give you your first puppy.""

""Thank you, Lucy. It would be marvelous if you did. Sven and I would love for you to be our surrogate. You're a beautiful young woman.""

Further discussion had to wait as we all heard a wolf howl, and Gregory said Roxanne was nearly here. Watchers outside.

We went outside to meet her just as her car drove up.

I greeted her first, since she knew me. ""Roxanne, thank you for coming. I know you remember my husband, Sean, and bodyguards, Brigitte and Alicia. This is my mother and father, Anita and Simon Huppert, my very good friend and lover, Gretchen, and her bodyguard, Ingrid. These are my in-laws of some sort or other, Peter and Lucy. Peter's sister just married a relative of mine. This is Gregory, the head of the organization that is willing to help you if you can help them, and Sven and his wife, Lana, one of the infertile couples who's hoping that you agree to be a surrogate mother for them. Why don't we go inside and talk some more?""

""Sure, thanks. I'd like that. It's hard to imagine that other people are having the same problems with conception as we are.""

As Sven and Lana escorted her inside, Gregory said softly. ""She's fertile now.""

""We'll see if she's ready to proceed now, although I suspect she'll want her own before she gives the pack one. My friends Martin and Melinda both wanted their own child first. I'll explore the topic with her.""

""You lead Wolf Daughter, we'll follow,"" Gregory said.

We had a seat and after a few minutes of fairly idle chit chat, I gave Roxanne her NDA.

""Roxanne, this is a non-disclosure agreement. You need to read this over very carefully and then sign it before we can discuss any business. It's very important you don't discuss anything you learn here today with anyone else; parents, siblings, even Winston. Winston will need to sign one as well, if you decide to tell him, but it may be you don't want him to know. That's entirely up to you. He doesn't absolutely have to know. I do know the consequences of violating the terms of the agreement are severe. One young man talked about what he'd learned and he's disappeared. I don't believe he's dead, but the federal government takes this very seriously.""

""Okay. I'm not sure why this is needed, but I won't talk about it.""

She read and signed the document and handed it back to me, and I handed it to Gregory.",,2025-08-15T18:49:40.948082,3621,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-millers-ch-11,The Millers Ch. 11,Unknown Author,,,,,"Entering the last month of my six month contract things had changed so much since its inception. Kayla was basically the only one who was benefiting from the contract. Robby barely spoke to me or acknowledged me any more.

Kayla required me to service her daily, tongue bath, foot worship, ass worship, piss drinking, massage, help with homework and reports, etc. She had mind fucked me to the point where I was 100% submissive, never even questioned or dared to challenge her on anything she wanted.

She was now trying to prepare me to sign a new contract for even longer this time. She would get me alone and tell me that I was just a piece of property any more and that I should just sign my life away indefinitely. I had no value except to service her and Robby. She made sure I knew that Robby was no longer in love with me and that it was just a matter of time before she became pregnant with his baby and he would marry her.

Not to worry though because she assured me that I would always have a place in their home as a pet/slave/servant, whatever the title. She got too big for her britches though and as part of her daily mind fuck she started to expand her self worth and basically started to tell me that Robby wasn't even worthy of her. She was so beautiful, she was so smart, she was so precious.

Although I sat there and took her abuse, verbal and of course daily to weekly beatings to keep me ""inline."" She was dumb enough to think that she had broken me and was about to get me to sign off my remaining rights to her so that she could make me miserable for years to come.

Little did she know that I had placed a nanny cam in my stuffed bear that sat on the dresser. While she was gone on one of her longer runs as she prepped for an upcoming triathlon I took the cam to Robby and showed him just how badly she was treating me and how little she thought of him.

I think I opened his eyes a bit. He apologized for the way things had turned out but did admit that he indeed had fallen out of love with me. He wasn't sure what to do about Kayla and had hinted that he may have something else on the back burner. I told him that I would probably not resign a contract which made me a slave for years to come. He told me to keep him informed as to what I wanted to do and he would do what he could to help me.

It was the last week of the month and I really wanted to have one more go around with the Grandpas because I had grown affectionately of the old guys. Robby lined up our usual party with them and decided that he would use the extra sperm he had been saving up. This party was called a bukkake affair and through Robby's careful preparation of his stockpile he had a bowl of almost 60 loads of cum thawed out and then warmed to proper temperature.

I was dressed up in my best school girl uniform and laid on the big square coffee table while the grandpas formed a circle jerk around me and let their loads loose all over my face, they ripped my shirt open exposing my boob less nipples and shot plenty of goo over those puffy little things. You could still count my ribs and the pool of pud juice filled my crevices including my eyes, mouth, neck stomach, navel and waist.

The gramps were careful not to crush me but a couple of them couldn't resist licking me and feeding me their cocks. I took every cummer and my last grandpa who mounted his little grand daughter was my favorite, Carl.

""You should see the cottage honey"" he beamed. We fixed up the guest house basement to make it better than that old basement we have been keeping you in when Robby let's us play captive.

""I'm sure You'll love it honey"" he assured me. ""I took all the ideas you had and I think we really nailed it"" said Carl.

""Thanks so much Grandpa"" I smiled, hiding my tears that were welling up in my eyes. ""I'm sure we'll have a great time there."" He slipped me the key to the guest house and I told him to keep this our little secret for now. The gleam in his eye gave me to know that he wasn't going to tell anyone.

Robby announced that he had to go away for a few days to train on this new machine and process for his day job. He left, leaving the wicked witch of the West in charge. All she needed was her flying monkeys. First day of his trip she woke me up and with everything she did or said she made a clear effort to be even more mean and ruthless than she had grown to be to me. I finally did break down and started to cry.

She slapped me and said, ""Fuck those tears you fucking baby."" ""Deal with it"" she screamed at me.

""Deal with it"" I thought to myself I wonder if she'd even be able to have a conversation at this point? I thought.

""Kayla I loved you more than life itself. I brought you into our bed. I offered to serve you both because I love you both so much. You treated me like total shit and then it got worse from there."" I cried.

""Oh boo fucking hoo"" she mocked me. ""Get over your self"" she hissed. ""Accept your role cunt!""

I snapped. ""Whap"" Then total darkness. . .",,2025-08-15T18:50:15.570888,980,
https://www.literotica.com/s/sharing-me-ch-02,Sharing Me Ch. 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"Casey smiled, still coming down from her earth shattering, squirting orgasm watching my cock splatter her best friend's pussy with cum. ""I knew you'd like it, Nikki. What about you, Nick?""

I looked down at Nikki who grinned at me and started gently rubbing her pussy, seductively smearing my cum. ""Yeah, that was fucking hot,"" I blurted out causing both women to laugh. I guess they didn't expect me to say anything too deep in the moment.

""Alright, I need a shower,"" announced Casey. ""You two are welcome to join me and get cleaned up or I guess you could always stay out here..."" She trained off.

""Come on,"" Nikki hopped up and softly grabbed my semi hard cock pulling my towards her best friend. ""Let's get your clean.""

The three of us all got in the steamy stand up shower. There was only one shower head, but we had an attachment so it split into two with one on a hose. Still the shower wasn't meant for three people so it was very intimate to say the least. Casey kissed me and then winked at me. Then she pushed Nikki against the wall and kissed her, their wet bodies pressed together. I had never heard Casey talk about any lesbian desires other than a celebrity girl crush so I was floored. Within seconds of watching their deep, passionate make out session I was fully hard again. My hand instinctively went to my cock, but Casey moved it away so I just had to stand there and watch. Watch their hands caressing each other's breasts, watch their soft lips together, watch their tongues explore each other's mouths.

After a couple minutes Casey pulled away. I could tell she wasn't expecting to be enjoying this as much as she was. Casey and Nikki smiled at each other then both sunk to their knees. Casey gave my cock a stroke before pointing it at Nikki. Nikki greedily swallowed half of my cock as Casey just watched from inches away. Nikki sucked on my slowly but purposely, making sure to coat me in her saliva. After a minute she stopped and Casey took over without missing a beat. Nikki's hand found Casey's pussy causing Casey to lose focus on me and let out the sexiest moan I've ever heard. Casey could tell I was getting close from their joint blowjob and let Nikki have another turn. As Nikki took my cock deeper in her throat, Casey gripped my ass and stared up at me. She smiled as her friend skillfully sucked her own juices and the mixture of their spit from my cock.

Casey bit her lip seductively and started to plead with me ""please cum, baby. Doesn't Nikki's mouth make you feel good?? Don't you want to cum in her mouth? I want to see it. I want to see your cock fill her mouth. Will you do that for me? Please? Cum. Cum. Cum now!""

I couldn't take anymore. One hand went to the wall for support, the other to Casey's head, holding her in place. Nikki pulled back but left my head in her mouth, making sure Casey could see my cock pulse, shooting warn cum into her friend's mouth. Nikki stared at me as my seed coated her tongue, not blinking as though she knew how well she just drained me. ""Ffffffuck,"" was all I could mange to say as her mouth popped off my head. Then the two women continued their make out session from earlier, only this time passing my cum back and forth from one mouth to the other. Nikki rose up which I'm sure meant she was spitting every drop of cum and saliva into Casey's mouth. Casey hadn't swallowed my load in ages so to see her accept this was so hot. Both of them kissed me on the cheek together then started laughing at the look of stunned satisfaction I had on my face.

The rest of the shower was sexy and fun as we all soaped up each other's bodies and washed every inch of each other. We teased each other, but it never progressed further than that. The water shut off and we all quietly dried off. After all the wine and sex all three of us were pretty beat so we continued to get ready for bed. The girls climbed into bed on either side of me, we turned on a movie, and all drifted off to sleep within minutes.

I woke up in a fog. I had been having a vivid dream and it felt like I was still in it. ""I need you inside me,"" a voice whispered in my ear. I turned to my right and found Casey sound asleep. Must've been in my dream, I thought. Then I felt a hand on my cock and Nikki's hot breath in ear. ""I'm so wet, I need to fuck you again.""

""Casey is asleep, this feels weird,"" I countered. Although I was already getting hard.

""She said I could do whatever I wanted with you, and right now I want to ride you,"" moaned Nikki. She pulled her hand to her pussy since we had all fallen asleep naked and I could feel how turned on she was. ""we're going to have to be silent if you don't want to wake her,"" Nikki whispered as she stroked me. I couldn't resist any longer.

""Get on top,"" I whispered back. Nikki quickly spun herself on top of me and guided my cock to her warm wet slit. She rocked her body back and her pussy pulled my foreskin back and welcomed me into her body. I wanted to scream in pleasure but had to remain silent. Nikki ground her pussy into me, holding me deep inside her, but making sure not to rock the bed too much. It was so dark that I couldn't see exactly what her face was doing but I could tell from there muscles insides her and her legs that she was enjoying herself.

The blankets rustled slightly and I turned back to my right to see Casey watching us and masturbating. I was about to apologize for violating her friend but Casey whispered ""shh, focus on her. I want to watch.""

Focusing my attention back to Nikki riding me, I reached down and found her clit. Nikki moaned and I heard Casey quietly gasp. Nikki's pace quickened and her movements became more deliberate. I had cum in Nikki's mouth and on her pussy, but I had yet to cum inside her. From the looks of things that was about to change. The bed was rocking, Nikki was moaning, and I could literally hear how wet Casey was from her masturbating.

""Ooo OHH,"" Nikki started to yell ""fuck, I'm cumming!"" I was bucking my hips up into her, a move that I knew Casey loved. Nikki's pussy locked around me and again I turned my head to look at my girlfriend. This time she was in beautiful agony, furiously rubbing herself and close to getting off to the sight of her boyfriend cumming inside of her friend. I moved one of my hands off Nikki's hip and grabbed Casey's leg. ""CUM!"" I ordered in a grunt as legs went rigid and my cock began to unload deep inside of Nikki. Casey bit my shoulder, screamed out, and then started convulsing against us.

Nikki slid off my softening cock and collapsed next to me again. Panting and dragging her fingernails on my chest. Casey's hand slowly made it's way down my stomach to touch my cock. ""Did you cum inside her?"" She whispered in my ear.

I paused, not knowing exactly what she wanted to hear. I decided to lean into her submissiveness and whispered back ""yes baby. Her pussy was so tight, I came so hard deep inside her.""

""Good boy,"" Casey responded. With that we all fell back asleep.

Sunshine poured into the room and woke the three of us. Slightly hungover, and thoroughly exhausted, we looked at each other while the events of the night prior came flooding back to us.

""Holy shit. Last night was hot, but the middle of the night was insane!"" Casey started. ""What got into you two?""

""I was having a sex dream, which NEVER happens to me, woke up, and I was so wet. I just needed to be fucked,"" said Nikki.

""It didn't take much to convince me,"" I said, to which both girls laughed.

""Okay, I'm going to go wash off. I think I still have some of your cum leaking out of me,"" Nikki chuckled as she got out of bed and headed to the bathroom.

""Oh my god, seriously I came so hard watching you with her last night!"" Casey said excitedly.

""She's got quite the appetite,"" I said with a grin. ""I'm glad we gave you a good show.""

""That was better than I ever could have imagined.""

""Wait, so have you two been planning this??""

""Yeah..."" Casey blushed. ""We got to talking months ago over a little too much wine, and got into sexual experiences and fantasies. You came up and the conversation completely changed.""

""I never expected this to happen,"" I said being honest.

""Good,"" Casey laughed. ""There's actually one more surprise..."" Her hand began rubbing my inner thigh.

""Mmmmm go on."" I couldn't tell what would be next, but I knew it would be good.

""I told Nikki that I never let you fuck me in the ass and she said she really enjoys anal sex."" Casey's hand found my cock and felt it get hard again. ""Mmhhmmm, that's what I thought! So she's going to come back any second and you're going to fuck her tight ass.""

""Are you serious?"" Was all I could say in my state of shock.

""Very serious. Watching how much pleasure she gives you makes my pussy explode. We'll all get off then go get brunch.""

Just then Nikki walked back into the room and kneeled between my legs on the bed. Casey pointed my hard cock up in the air and Nikki circled my head with her tongue before deep throating me. Just three bobs and she popped off, leaning back and spreading her legs.

""So, how would you like to fuck my ass?"" Nikki said seductively. She moved in between Casey and I so that the two girls were next to each other. Casey handed her a bottle of lube that Nikki offered to me. ""Casey mentioned you guys don't do anal and I told her I always cum when a guy fucks my ass,"" she winked at Casey.

Still in disbelief, all I could do was nod yes. Nikki smiled, laid back, spread her legs, raised her hips, and slid a pillow underneath her so I could access her tight hole. I applied a generous amount of lube to my cock and scooted forward so my shiny cock was inches away from her ass. Casey curled up next to Nikki, ready for the show. Nikki had a naughty grin on her face and then mouthed 'fuck my ass.' I pressed my cock head into her tight wrinkled hole and pushed forward and Nikki groaned in a mixture of pleasure and pain.

""How does it feel?"" Breathed Casey.

""It hurts a little at first, but I always find it starts to feel good when he's deep inside me,"" panted Nikki. Then she crossed her ankles behind my back and pulled me all the way into her making all three of us cry out in various forms of pleasure. ""Don't hold back,"" Nikki said with a grin. ""Use my ass to get yourself off."" Nikki grabbed Casey's hand and placed it on her pussy. ""Casey is going to help me cum.""

This was unbelievably hot. My girlfriend was starting to rub her friend's clit as my cock was buried in her ass! I grabbed Nikki's legs and started pistoning in and out of her. Her tight canal had an intense grip on my cock and I was fucking with everything I had. Nikki's had was thrown backwards in pleasure, her mouth open, a constant whimper escaping it.

Casey was simultaneously working Nikki's clit as well as her own. Occasionally she would look up at my face but her attention was really focused on my cock and rubbing Nikki's clit.

""That's it, that's the spot. Work that clit while your boyfriend fucks my ass,"" Nikki teased. This caused Casey to whimper and rub both of their clits faster. I could feel the shockwaves of pleasure going through Nikki's body and knew she was getting closer to another orgasm. Her ass kept clinching around my cock and she was convulsing on the bed, the combination of her friend rubbing her and me pounding her ass was getting to be too much.

""Fuck fuck fuck fuck oh my god. Keep going, keep going,"" shouted Nikki. ""Yes yessss YESSS! I'm cumming!"" Nikki bucked in bed and her ass clamped down on my cock, it was almost too tight to fuck. The three of us were a sweaty mess all wrapped up together.

With Nikki spent, Casey rolled onto her back and focused on her own pleasure. From the look on her face, I could tell she was seconds from an orgasm of her own.

""Cum. Cum in her ass,"" Casey begged.

That's all it took. I buried my cock deep in Nikki's ass and started filling her with cum. Her tunnel milked every drop out of my balls as Nikki gyrated her hips with a satisfied grin on her face. Watching this made Casey orgasm again. She screamed out in pleasure, unable to stifle her yells. My cock slipped out of Nikki's ass and I collapsed between the two of them, completely spent.

The last 24 hours had been filled with some of the best, most unexpected sex I had ever had. Never in a million years would I have expected my sweet girlfriend to enjoy watching me fuck her sexy friend. Yet here I was, and from the looks of things I'd be able to fuck Nikki in frying of Casey more.",,2025-08-15T18:50:22.187294,2367,

As to what specific part(s) that may be fictional ... well... I'll let you figure that out on your own.

I hope you enjoy this read and will consider leaving me a comment at the end too.

""My submissive slut wife stays in chastity most of the time. I learned long ago she needs it and it's good for her,"" John told Lisa.

Lisa thought this sounded amazingly hot and said, ""Damn John! Can I see it for myself?""

John pulled out his phone where he then pulled up the latest pic of his hot, submissive wife Amy in her chastity belt. Lisa studied it for a minute, then after draining the last of her red wine and setting her glass down on the bar said, ""I meant that I want to see it in PERSON!""

John's face had a sly moment of realization where he then slowly said, ""Careful what you wish for.""

""I know EXACTLY what I am wishing for!"" Lisa said in her most seductive voice while running her tongue over the outside of her lips.

John's face lit up with excitement as he finished off his own glass. He then leaned into Lisa to plant a kiss on her lips. After an erotic long and slow kiss, he pulled away and said, ""Let me pay for these drinks and we can go home.""

Lisa hopped off the bar stool and said, ""Sounds like fun! Let's go!""

After John tendered payment, he grabbed up Lisa's hand and they went to his car together. Like the perfect gentleman he is, John opened Lisa's door for her and helped her settle into his car.

He went around to the driver side and climbed in. Before putting on his seatbelt, he turned toward Lisa, grabbed up her hand and kissed it softly. Then he said, ""Are you sure, my love? Are you sure you want to go meet my wife?""

Lisa smiled and in her most seductive voice said, ""Yes. It's time.""

With that, John pulled out his phone and texted Amy, ""Headed home now. Will be there in 15. Be in position sweetheart.""

As John thought about taking his girlfriend Lisa home to meet his wife Amy, he felt his cock growing more rigid with every mile. They didn't speak much on the ride home, which was okay by John as he thought about the pending night's events. He didn't know exactly how this would end up going but he had every confidence it would be a good time for all.

As John walked in the house, Lisa followed closely behind. As John expected, Amy was in her proper position to greet him. She was kneeling by the door, wearing nothing but her chastity belt (to which John was the keyholder). John held one foot out and Amy removed his shoe, setting it aside. Then the other foot where that shoe was also removed.

John reached down and pulled Amy's chin upward so that she looked directly into his eyes. She gave the typical greeting which was, ""Welcome Home Sir.""

He also gave his typical responsive greeting back of, ""Thank you my lovely slut. You look as stunning as ever. Were you a good girl in my absence?""

""Yes Sir."" came back her response.

With that, he took her hand and helped her rise to her feet. That was when she first noticed Lisa standing behind John. She looked at Lisa and back to John and back to Lisa.

Amy, being the submissive wife she is, immediately lowered her head and looked downward to the floor where she spoke to Lisa properly.

""Greetings ma'am. Welcome to our home.""

Lisa then said to John, ""Wow! She's even better than you described. How did you get such an amazing wife?""

John gave a half chuckle and said, ""Well..... We've worked hard to build the perfect marriage. She didn't come to me this way and it hasn't been easy, but it's definitely been worth it!""

He turned to Amy and said, ""Isn't that right, slut?""

Amy's only response was exactly what John expected, which was a swift and decisive, ""Yes Sir.""

Lisa then added, ""Can I touch it?""

Everyone knew she was asking to touch Amy's chastity belt.

John said, ""Sure. Check it out all you want.""

With that Lisa walked right up to Amy where her face was just a few mere inches from Amy's. Since Amy was still standing with her eyes to the floor Lisa whispered, ""Look at me.""

Amy lifted her head so that her eyes stared straight into Lisa's.

While never breaking eye contact, Lisa's hand started exploring the belt. She started at Amy's waist and felt all around. Her hand then moved around to the lock in front and gave a swift and firm tug down on it, finding it didn't move much at all. John was always careful to ensure the lock was secure.

Amy started to slide her hand straight down the front of the belt where she felt the hard dome shaped shell encasing that covered Amy's pussy in its entirety. Lisa attempted to penetrate the sides of the encasement in a test to just how secure was this contraption anyway. Lisa didn't get far, and she certainly couldn't finger Amy's clit at all, which pleased Lisa immensely!

Lisa then broke into the biggest, most sly grin ever and said, ""OK!! This thing is secure and tight. Interesting. Alright, this will be fun then!""

With that, Lisa walked several steps further into the house and right past Amy and John both. She then stopped, turned back, and asked, ""Well... aren't you going to invite me in? Show me around already? Offer me a drink? Something?!""

John looked at her, smiled, then turned back toward Amy. He snapped his fingers at his wife and said, ""Well... slut.. You heard your Mistress. Get her a drink already!""

""Yes Sir,"" Amy said, although she was already on her way.

John knew by referring to Lisa as ""Mistress"" that his wife would understand her place in this food chain is squarely at the bottom. Of course, that was nothing new for Amy and she didn't mind.

In just a few short minutes, Amy was back with two glasses of red wine, where she handed the first to Amy and the second to John. She then turned to go back to get a glass for herself, when Lisa stopped her asking, ""Where do you think you're going?""

When Amy told her, Lisa said, ""No. I don't believe that's at all necessary!""

She motioned for Amy to come towards her, which she did. When Amy was near enough, Lisa wrapped her arm around the back of Amy's head and pulled her in for a deep all-tongue kiss. A kiss where Lisa transfered a mouthful of wine into Amy's mouth from hers.

When Lisa pulled back, she said, ""I think I've already got all the fluids you will need tonight. That's just the start. If you are a good little wifey-poo tonight, I'll let you have more where that came from.... probably from my other hole too... but only if you are good!""

Lisa then turned to John and said, ""Now that she's met me, take me to bed already!""

Lisa turned back to Amy and said, ""You don't mind if I fuck your husband now, right?I mean, you ARE all locked up so he certainly can't fuck you. I don't imagine you mind, do you slut?!""

Amy turned her eyes back to the floor and said, ""No Mistress.""

Lisa said, ""No Slut. Look me in the eyes and tell me what I can do with your husband.""

With that, Amy looked back up, straight into Lisa's eyes, and said, ""Mistress, please fuck my husband however you wish.""

Lisa was intentionally trying to humiliate Amy at this point, and decided to push Amy even one step further by asking, ""And what exactly can John do to me?""

""Anything he wishes Mistress.""

Lisa could tell that Amy fully meant what she just said. It was utterly humiliating for her though and yet somehow Lisa suspected THIS was exactly how Amy liked it too. Knowing all this pleased Lisa to no end!

Lisa had expected nothing different from this meeting of John's wife. This was going exactly how Lisa envisioned it.

John and Lisa had been dating for more than 6-months now where John had been open and honest with Lisa about his marriage to Amy from the start. At first Lisa was put off and inclined to walk away, saying how she was no ""home wrecker,"" but for some strange reason, John was so compelling she chose to stay and listen.

His honesty and Lisa's intrigue was probably why Lisa felt this arrangement may just work! Lisa already felt it was ultimately turning into one of the most amazing relationships she'd ever been in!

All that said though, Lisa also knew if this relationship was to last much longer she wanted and felt she needed to meet Amy in person too. She needed to know for certain if how John had described their marriage dynamic was indeed the way it was.

And .... if Lisa were being honest, she wanted to play with Amy AND John both! While Lisa mostly wanted to play with Amy mentally, she was pleased to no end to know this dumb bitch would have her cunt locked up so that no one, including her, would even think there was a more beautiful pussy than her own!

That's when Lisa smiled big and said to John, ""You really HAVE trained this one well. I'm impressed!""

Then she added, ""Now, you heard your slut... show me the way!""

While this relationship dynamic was something altogether new for Lisa, it was anything but new for John and Amy.

It was ages ago now that John had confronted Amy with the reality that she just wasn't enough for him. John had fully expected Amy to want a divorce when he told her that while he loved her deeply and passionately, he just needed more than she could provide. It wasn't her fault, it just was what it was though too.

However, to his happy surprise Amy seemed like this wasn't a surprising thought for her. Instead of being angry or irrational, Amy had a profound understanding in her eyes. And she actually looked like she may have a sense of relief!

Amy had always thought it was an odd concept that just ONE woman was supposed to somehow always and forever be enough to satisfy a man's every need and desire. Amy was never quite comfortable and always felt on edge as she tried to push down the constant nagging feeling of, ""If you aren't ALWAYS enough for him, he will leave you.""

So in that moment, she walked up and draped her arms around his neck in a big hug. She then said, ""I understand and its ok. Kinda like while eating steak is amazing, no one wants to eat only steak every night for the rest of your life either. Sometimes you just need variety and to mix it up. Sometimes you then just crave a good fish or chicken too.""

That all resonated with John. So instead of being on their way to the courthouse for a divorce, that very same day, he had opened an account on a dating app. That was the start of their marital sexual awakening too.

As John dated around, he became increasingly more Dominant with Amy. At the same time, Amy had started to realize her craving to start becoming the best submissive wife she could be too. They were living their best marriage days ever!

John had had other girlfriends before but none had ever lasted this long. Amy only got to meet the ones John really liked a lot, so by bringing her home to meet the wife, Amy knew John had strong feelings for Lisa. Amy was certain this one was extra special!

That was when John and Lisa clinked wine glasses and John said, ""Then let's do this!""

As they walked down the hall towards the master suite, Amy had the distinct feeling she wasn't being invited to participate tonight, so she just watched and waited. She knew better than to speak until spoken to.

To Amy's surprise though, John turned back and said, ""Slut wife, if you think you can be obedient to only do as you are told, and only speak when specifically spoken to, then you can come with us.""

He continued, ""I pretty much want your complete obedience tonight so I can focus entirely on Lisa's pleasure without distractions. Am I clear?""

""Yes Sir,"" Amy dutifully responded.

She also felt her pussy juice up behind the dome cover of her belt at now being included too.

Even though Amy expected to probably only have limited interaction with them tonight, that was ok because she also knew she could have easily been left out altogether too!

When they got to the bedroom amd still standing just beside the bed, John sat his wine glass down to turn his full attention to Lisa and her perky tits. He started pressing his tongue down her throat then too. She was lapping it up and clearly doing everything possible to encourage him to give her more.

When they pulled apart, she looked at Amy. Then after taking another big gulp to finish off her glass of wine, she motioned for Lisa to come close. When she did, Lisa once again pushed the wine deep into Amy's mouth.

Lisa then proceeded to tell Amy she was a hot wife and how fucking sexy it was that she's locked up.

She then also told Amy, I think I rather like knowing that only MY pussy will be touched. That MY pussy is the one he wants tonight. Hell. I think you want my pussy too. Yours is .... well... rather pathetically locked and therefore useless.... And THAT is a good thing!""

""Yes Mistress,"" came Amy's response. There it was. Confirmation that she'd not see much action, but again, something is better than nothing.

After just a few minutes of heavy petting and kissing, John lifted up and started to take Lisa's shirt off. It was then that Lisa immediately stopped him saying, ""Wait Sweatheart! I see no reason for either of us to not use your slut here to help.""

Lisa looked around to find Amy kneeling on the floor by the door. Lisa was again impressed that John had trained her to be close, but not too close, and silent as a mouse too.

Lisa said to Amy, ""wife-y poo, get your ass over here and help your hubby get us naked already.""

Amy said nothing but immediately did as she was told. She stood and walked up to lift Lisa's shirt up and over her arms where her full boobs flopped back down against her chest after being released from the shirt. Of course she had no bra on.

Lisa grabbed up her boobs, while pressing them together and asked Amy, ""What do you think about these?""

Humbled and a bit shyly Amy said, ""They are beautiful Mistress. I see why John is so attracted to you.""

Amy really wanted to also ask if she could touch them, but remembered what Sir had said about not speaking anymore than she had to too.

Lisa responded with, ""You really think so? I don't even think these are my best feature. In fact, I happen to think my pussy is just that much better.""

Lisa decided to rub it in a little more by saying, ""I would say we could compare pussies, but I'm already confident mine is more superior than yours. If nothing else, mine isn't locked behind steel!"" And she let put a devilish laugh.

""While I love being with both men AND women, I've always preferred to be licked far more than the one doing the licking. So this chastity belt thing will serve us both quite well as I get what I want - to never see, feel, or touch your pussy - and you get what you deserve and need - mine!""

And there it was again. Lisa ensuring Amy's humiliation was complete, right along with another reinforcement of her superiority over Amy.

With that, Lisa motioned for Amy to move toward John to help him with the removal of his shirt. As she completed the task, John smiled at Amy. He then put a hard squeeze on her nipples that made Amy wince while saying, ""You are an amazing submissive wife. I love you so much!""

He knew just how to build Amy up so that he ensured she knew who she was and how much she meant to him.

While Amy knew she shouldn't be pleased with all this, she was. Amy loved being the submissive one. She wondered if her pussy juices were already dripping through the dome slits as she suspected it probably was! She didn't dare put a hand down to feel though.

It was shortly thereafter when John and Lisa were both still standing by the bed naked that Lisa instructed Amy to ""get on the floor now and start fingering your Mistress to get me wet, while sucking on your Sir's cock to get him hard.""

They stood towering above Amy as she knelt down between them to get working on fluffing them both.

That was when Lisa said to John, ""You weren't kidding when you talked about how obediently submissive your wife is! I'm curious though, if she listens this well, why the need for the chastity belt?""

While Amy heard them talking plainly about her, she dutifully kept at her job without skipping a beat. She knew she sucked cock better than most and she could get John hard in just another heartbeat.

It was then that John said, ""After I had brought a previous girlfriend home to meet Amy, it wasn't too long thereafter when she told us how angry and annoyed she'd become with Amy. She seemed to think Amy was a selfish cum slut, who was only out to get what Amy wanted, which was to be able to ride my cock until she orgamed.""

""It was then that my girlfriend suggested the chastity belt for Amy so as to have her constantly reminded of her place and purpose, which was to he submissive at ALL times.""

It was becoming more difficult for John to talk as Amy continued sucking his cock. She was really into it tonight and sucked as if her life depended on it but he did manage to continue talking too.

""At first Amy took exception to it, which was to be expected. Amy realized her ability to orgasm was about to be out of her control and her place as a submissive was about to be cemented into history too. Although it also wasn't long before Amy saw how much I really liked this girl too. So with some persuading, Amy knew she needed to submit.""

Lisa tapped Amy on the head to get her attention where she asked, ""Is all this true?""

""Yes Mistress.""

""So you were self indulging? You were seeking out your own orgasms first?""

Amy's answer remained the same, ""Yes Mistress.""

Lisa gave a shake of her finger and a ""tsk-tsk"" sound too. Lisa said, ""why would you do such a thing? That's such a selfish thing to do!""

Amy said, ""I know that now Mistress.""

Lisa then looked at John and said, ""Well. At least she learned.""

Lisa told Amy to get back to work but to switch. She said, ""As promised, I'm going to allow you to suck on my pussy for awhile now. John can probably stay hard for me while he waits his turn to use my oussy if you give him a hand job too.""

Amy did as told without hesitation. And now she was sure her own pussy was leaking out of the dome and down her leg. While she was utterly turned on, she knew without clit stimulation she wouldn't orgasm though.

Amy had sucked many a pussy since becoming John's submissive wife and her tongue had long sine mastered the process. Lisa immediately let Amy know she approved without words, but instead by emitting seductive moans.

John said, ""Actually I think the belt took care of a lot of that training for us. The first chastity belt she wore was a cheap knock off one that didn't fit too well, but we only made Amy wear it when my girlfriend was over so it was working well enough. Until I came to realize just how much Amy was simply holding back on her own desires, just biding her time until my girlfriend left and she was released. ""

""Once Amy was released from the belt, she would practically attack me like a rabid dog, seeking to achieve her own orgasm. Sometimes I indulged, but in times when I refused, I'd catch her masturbating. I just saw how much a needy slut she really was, hence the name now too.""

""That was when I got her fitted for this custom fitted belt. It certainly wasn't cheap but it was worth it. Now she wears it nearly all the time too and it has worked miracles. She's super submissive and attends to my desires more than ever. I suspect she does it in hopes to get rewarded with an orgasm or two of her own, but it works for us. Sometimes she gets her reward and.. well... sometimes not.""

Lisa made a comment about just how amazing it was to have a beautiful slut wife turned into such an amazing submssive one too. Amy was proud then of what she heard and dove into sucking on Lisa's pussy even more than she had been.",,2025-08-15T18:50:54.662502,3705,
https://www.literotica.com/s/dinner-is-at-6,Dinner is at 6,Unknown Author,,,,,"""Cheater! Cheater!"" I jeered at one of my best friends. My fingers furiously attacking the buttons in a futile attempt to thwart fate.

""Call me whatever you want, but I'm still going to be your daddy!"" Camie answered back as she soundly defeated me once again.

AS Camie cried out in victory, I leaned back taking in my ninth loss of the night. Even still, I couldn't stop a grin from unabashedly showing up on my face. It was good to see Camie, we had been good friends for some time now but life had gotten in the way of us hanging out and so it was good to finally have time to hang out with her.

""I always knew you were a masochist."" Camie said as she saw the grin on my face.

I rolled my eyes. ""From what I remember, it's actually you who likes pain.""

Camie's nostrils flared and I saw her eyes narrowed, but I knew who I was talking to, so I figured I was safe. Camie and I's friendship had started off at first as a rivalry, both of us competing for the attention of the girls in the local bars in our college years. Soon after we realized how similar we were and how much more fun it was helping each other score girls. Eventually we found ourselves in one of the best of friendships.

""Whatever, come get your ass kicked again."" She said, a smirk on her lips.

Grinning, I picked up my controller and we started back up the game.

Camie had quickly made good on her word and kicked my ass about ten more times before I had to call it quits. After some good-natured ribbing from her, I was able to switch over to a movie to nurse my damaged ego.

After popping some popcorn and grabbing a few drinks, we were ready.

Setting up all the stuff, I leaned back on the couch. I raised an eyebrow when Camie reached over grabbed a beer, popped it open and downed it all in one go, but didn't say anything. That's what hanging out with friends was for.

After slamming her beer, I felt as Camie leaned into me, snuggling as she did so. It had been some time since we saw each other, and it felt nice to be close to one another after all this time. Pulling up the remote I hit play and watched as the opening credits rolled by.

""Hey...James?""

I hit pause. It was unlike Camie to be apprehensive about anything. Something was up.

""What's up?""

Camie appeared to shift around uncomfortably while still clinging closely to me. She brushed back her hair revealing the pathway of piercings that decorated her ears.

If there was someone that didn't do uncomfortable or hesitation it was Camie. Camie and I were about the same size on the shorter end. Her hair was dark, and she always had a more mischievous look about her. She was an avid partaker in outdoor yoga boasting of the tan lines and figure to prove it.

""Do you remember that one girl? Amber Dens?"" She finally asked. Her hands making motions around her chest.

Amber Dens had been one of the girls that Camie and I had both tried for. An adorable, bisexual who had enjoyed flashing bartenders, she had taken a liking to both of us and proposed a threesome.

I, of course, had agreed immediately being heavily attracted to both girls. Camie had been apprehensive and was adamant about being a lesbian and not interested into being with a guy. Eventually, Amber got Camie to agree to a sort of roundabout threesome where I would have sex with her and then she would have sex with her.

It was actually after her that Camie and I would start to form a friendship instead of the rivalry we had at the time.

""Yeah, I do."" I said answering. ""She was a wild one.""

""Yeah,"" Camie agreed absentmindedly. ""Do you remember what she got you to do?""

Amber and I had done it raw. In the middle of fucking, she had started to whisper in my ear to cum inside her and that she was going to have Camie lick it out. That had put me into overdrive, and I soon finished inside her.

After some light kissing, she had kicked me out of the bedroom and Camie had gone in after. I figured that it had just been some dirty talking but the way that Camie seemed to be struggling with her words told me that there was something uncomfortable coming up.

""She had told me to cum insider her."" I let her know. ""And that she was going to have you lick it out. I figured that it was just dirty talk.""

Camie looked like she was still struggling to say what she wanted. ""Well, it wasn't. It had been a fantasy of hers to have someone do that.""

""Oh."" A simple word but it was all I really was able to say at the time. A lot of thoughts were going through my head. I was ashamed to say that the one that continued to come up was an image of Camie gleefully eating my cum.

""Are you okay?"" I managed to get out, my concern of my friend finally overpowering my libido.

Camie nodded up and down rapidly. ""It's not that... I told Cleo that, and we had started talking about it...,"" she trailed off again.

Cleo Voltgard was Camie' wife. Before her, Camie had been a fuckyboy of a lesbian, constantly chasing skirts and going after the next, newest thing. Camie constantly blamed her wandering eyes on the lack of stability in her relationships. Then Cleo appeared. Almost instantly, it was like Camie had become a different person. Cleo had tamed Camie in one week what some girls had tried to do for months, and one persistent girl, a year.

""What had Cleo say?"" I asked. Cleo was an amazing woman, and she was also protective. I was honestly worried that they had decided that this was going to be one of the final hangouts with Camie and me. A last supper sort of situation.

""She had asked if I like it."" She eventually got out. ""I had told her that I had. We sat down and had a long talk.""

I could tell that it was embarrassing and confusing for Camie. Living your whole life as an out and proud lesbian and then suddenly finding yourself enjoying the taste of a man, so to speak.

""How did she take it?""

Camie pursed her lips. I allowed her all the time she needed.

Eventually, Camie told me. Apparently, Camie's exploration and experimentation had awakened something in Cleo as well. Soon, both of them had begun discussing fantasies that they had about men. She began explaining the nuances of it and the conversations with their sex therapist that helped them process it. I would love to say it was eye opening but, I was too busy trying to get the everything downstairs under control. I mean, lesbians talking about wanting a man was some sexual fantasy gold. Regardless, I think Camie was happier that I was here even if not fully listening to decompress from it all.

""So, you guys want men to have sex with you, but you don't want to have sex with men."" I summarized when she was done.

""You make it sound like something that isn't earth-shattering to my very way of life."" Camie grumbled. ""But essentially yes. And it's when a man has sex with either one of us, we don't want to have sex with a man, but we want the man to use us.

""So, something like a rape fantasy, almost.""

""Yeah, Cleo wants more to be forced to have sex with a man, I... happened to like the idea of her being forced and watching. I also want to be forced to pleasure that same man that forces my wife."" Camie also went to a whisper as she said the last part.

""You're a cuckquean and then some."" I said in surprise.

""I'm a cuckquean."" Camie laughed in resignation as she snuggled into me.

We laughed together for a while as the weird air was finally cleared.

""So,"" I asked after finishing our laughter. ""Are you guys going to ask someone I know or are you going with a rando?""

""For what?"" Camie asked, surprised.

""To cuck you."" I said, sounding like it was oblivious. ""And like do all of this."" I waved my hands around, gesturing between us.

Immediately, her expression changed becoming one of disblief. ""Are you fucking serious?""

""I thought you would want to share. I mean, you literally just told me about your new fetish and all.""

""Yeah, idiot."" She said slapping my arm. ""Because we want it to be you.""

I was lucky my eyebrows were still attached to my face otherwise they would have shot off. It had never connected in my head that the reason Camie had told me about her new sexual desires because they involved me.

Camie witnessing my shock just rolled her eyes as she called me an idiot again. ""We knew we didn't want a random as they probably wouldn't understand. And we like you, you're sweet and considerate.""

She chuckled. ""We shared enough girls between us that I know you know what you're doing at this point. You are pretty kink-friendly from what I know about you, so we figured you were the best guy for the job.""

""Plus, my charming, good looks.""

""If you were a woman, you would look pretty good.""

I accepted that was probably the best I was going to get from Camie.

Regaining my composure, I gave it a token consideration. Both Cleo and Camie were amazingly beautiful to me, and I would usually give anything to do something like this. She was right though, getting a random or a friend to participate in sex can all come with their own problems. I was happy that they had taken their time and research, and doubly happy it came around to me.

""It would be my honor to cuck you."" I told her solemnly.

Camie, of course responded with hitting me a few more times.

""Just one more thing."" She said after her assault on my person.

""Yeah, what is it?"" I asked, ready to listen. After all this would be her wife I'm fucking. It just seemed common sense to listen to the person getting cucked.

""I wanted to fuck you first."" Camie tried to explain but as soon as those words came out of her mouth, the widest smile appeared on my face. I couldn't help it. One of my best female friends, a fuckboy of a lesbian that had recently settled down, admitting that they want to fuck you is just something money can't buy. ""Hey, lose that smirk off your face. I meant in a make sure you can fulfil my wife kind of way.""

""Oh, I'll be filling your wife."" The weird air had dissipated. It felt good to go back to being ourselves around each other.

""Fuck you.""

""Isn't that what you want?""

Camie rolled her eyes and grinned. I saw her reach down and pop open another beer. ""Let's go over what makes this work.""

I mimed being a waiter. ""How are you looking to get fucked today?""

Camie took a sip and seemed to think about it. Eventually we went through the game plan and what made this work. The biggest problem was creating the feel of where a lesbian fucking a straight man would make sense. After all, a lot of this was essentially role play and finding the right motivation was important in spaces like that.

""Since you want me to cuck you,"" I said spit balling. ""Why don't we play this as we're fucking so you can make sure that when I fuck you wife, I'm doing a good job.""

Camie frowned a little. ""But isn't that what I was already going to be doing?""

""Just imagine it a little. Imagine instead of trying to determine if I'm good at sex but imagine it as me showing you how'll I'll fuck your wife.""

I watched Camie mull it over, sipping down more beer as she did. ""Okay, I think that'll work. You're going to have to be more convincing.:

""""Oh, I will. I'll show you what your wife has been missing.""

Camie let out a groan full of desire and disgust. ""I still can't believe after coming out as a lesbian, I still found myself fucking men.""

""Sexuality is strange."" I console her.

Camie simply made a face. It scrunched up her face, putting her nose in focus. It was a cute nose. We stared at each other. It felt strange, and yet, oddly safe to look at her as I might look at a girl that I was trying to pick up. I picked up on the slope of her nose, the stray freckles, the makeup that had been used to accentuate the eyes, the lipstick she had applied. All things that I would not have spare a second to see, I was now noticing.

I thought I would be nervous or at least weirded out. But I wasn't, maybe it had been the conversation before, maybe it was how close we were as friends, maybe it was the idea that Camie had put on makeup just for me. Whatever it was it had put me completely at ease as we kissed for the first time.

The kisses came naturally. They flowed slow and friendly, like a greeting more than anything. In a way, there was almost something pure about what was happening, that it was being there for your friend in their most vulnerable.

Camie pursued her lips thoughtfully as we pulled away.

""Everything okay?"" I said, now very aware of not having brushed my teeth this morning.

""Oh, yeah, yeah,"" Camie answered. ""It's just kissing a guy..."" A pause. ""It's different. Not bad, just different.""

Breathing out a sigh of relief, we began to kiss again. I kept my kisses soft and slow, letting Camie lead. I felt more comfortable letting Camie chose the speed, after all this was her fetish.

""Okay, okay."" Camie said, pushing me back. ""I don't know if you were doing this for my sake, but I didn't just reveal my soul to make out with you, you know. It's time to turn up the heat!""

""Alright then."" I told her. Having been given an invitation to start getting more aggressive, I took it. Before my hands had just been around her, supporting her. Now, they roamed. Like before with the kisses, I had a slow and tender touch, letting Camie get used to feeling me feeling her.

""That's more like it."" Camie whispered in approval, almost growling. Her eyes half lowered as they brimmed with excitement and desire. She was giving me fuck-me eyes.

Like that all thoughts of purity vanished. Any thoughts that had remained our friendship, supporting one another in times of need, or any other turned only into one singular thought: To fuck Camie with everything I had.

""Then shut up and show me how you're going to pleasure the man that's going to fuck your wife.""

Camie gave me a pleading look. This time as we came close, she began to softly kiss my neck. She continued down, spending time at the collarbone as she kissed down, her mouth began to explore lower and lower. After removing my shirt, she continued down my chest before getting to my waist.

""Take off your pants.""

My eyebrows almost flew off the second time today. I wasn't used to having Camie talk so submissively to me or obey me. That and then also the added effect of having a lesbian want to blow me had my mind blown.

Camie's face beginning to get flushed with embarrassment. ""Please take off your pants."" Her eyes unable to meet mine as she kept them almost pointedly at my crotch.

Camie trying to get my pants off while attempting to ask nicely and getting red in the face soon had me at pushing the bounds of my pants as my erection threatened to break free.

I began to frantically unbutton my pants and pushed them off me, my underwear sliding off easy. I was incredible excited for this next part as I flopped back down on the couch.

Camie stood up and walked over across from me. It looked like she was summoning her strength as she lowered herself to her knees between my legs.

I watched with bated anticipated as her hand came around my dick, it started off shakily but soon she was pumping me with even strokes. Camie's face was mesmerized as she continued to stroke me. It was probably the first time she had seen, much less stroked a dick.

As she got used to me and became more confident, I watched as Camie opened her mouth and began to tentatively put me in her mouth. Touching me with her tongue nervously, it was fascinating to watch her start to get more used to blowing me as she began to wrap her tongue around me, kissing it with more convincing passion, soon taking me fully.

With one last lick from base to tip, she finished, looking pleased with herself. Disappointed that she hadn't tried the balls, I was still excited to return the favor.

Like Camie had done, I started trailing down her neck, using my hands rub across her. Camie got the message and started to strip off her shirt, a black lacy bra coming into the picture. Camie wasn't that chesty, having more of a modest bust. The bra soon came off and I took a second to admire the shape of them before descending on them like a ravenous beast. As Camie moaned underneath my attack, I shifted playing with the nipples in my mouth, biting and suck, drawing out her moans.

Finishing up with those, I continued down. Her stomach had been toned and I surfed down with my mouth, past the navel piercing, before hitting the barrier of her pants. Now it was her turn to unbutton, moving slower than I had, she whipped off her panties too, not letting me get a chance to see if it was a matching pair, leaving her stark naked.

As long as Camie and I had been friends and rivals, we had consistently shared our mutual preferences for the bare pussy. It still surprised me to find Camie with one. It shined back at me, slick with desire which I was happy to find. After all, a wet pussy was a happy pussy.

""Like what you see?"" Camie asked. It lacked the usually teasing nature of our friendship and seemed more open and vulnerable.

""I can't wait to taste it."" I told her, miming holding a fork and a knife. She laughed in response as I went to work.

I kissed around the area, getting accustomed to having a man go down on her. Tonguing and kissing the area awound, I waited until I could see the gleam of her wetness start to appear on the outer end of her lips before I dove in.

As I saw the lips start to pool, I began to move in, lapping at the small, hardened gem that was her clit. I staged an aggressive conquest of her clit, making sure to remain on it for as long as I could.

Camie had started getting louder and shifting from underneath me, struggling against her orgasm that was building up. I pushed her hips down, keeping her anchored to the ground as I forced her into climax. With two hands snaking into my hair, I felt the familiar grip of a woman going past the brink and I kept my pace. Once the climax had tapered off, I moved back, my chin wet with victory.

""That was weird."" Camie said breathless, a strange light in her eyes.

""Bedroom?""

""Bedroom.""

Watching Camie lay naked on my bed was an amazing aphrodisiac. I moved to join her, pushing her down as I did so. Camie had already spread her legs as I began to shift my hips, my dick laying against her pussy. Ever slide against her threatened to suck me in.

""Are you imagine me doing this to your wife?""

""Shut up."" Camie breath was rapid, her heartbeat pumping against my skin. She was wildly excited. I could see the way her eyes began to shine and knew that the image was starting to form in her head.

This time when I slide against her, I felt myself sliding in. As soon as I did so, I felt Camie start to grab hold of me. I could feel her adjust herself to steady herself. She didn't push or pull me, so I knew I was in a good spot.

""Why is it so warm?"" Camie whispered into my ear. The idea of Camie only now experiencing real flesh and blood dick now was an immediate turn on, I had to control myself not to start pounding her with everything I had. That was going to be later.

""Are you imagining how good this is going to feel for your wife?""

Camie could only bit into my shoulder, her fingers starting to dig deeper into my back and arms. Muffled moans and whimpers came from her.

I began to push deeper into her gradually, letting out a satisfied sigh as I felt her take all of me. A muffled groan from my collarbone told me she had enjoyed the movement. As I begun to pull out, I grinned to myself as I watched my dick slick with her wetness. Now was the time to show Camie what having sex with a guy was all about.

Pumping at a moderate pace, I introduced Camie to getting fucked by a man. The slickness of her kept my dick moving. I groaned as I pulled back once more, Camie's pussy was an inferno vortex. I didn't think I was going to last long.",,2025-08-15T18:51:00.582078,3712,

By TexGG

As the rays from the early morning sun peaked through his windows, Nicholas rolled out of bed, groggily stumbling into the bathroom. He quietly and absent-mindedly went through his morning routine, washing his hands, splashing his face, and running his hands through his hair in attempt to remove the trace evidence of bedhead. Finally deeming himself presentable, he went out back to his bedroom and paused. He... had shut his bedroom door last night, didn't he? He usually did, but this morning, it was cracked open, allowing the sounds and smells of a sizzling breakfast to waft in. Ooh, breakfast! His reflections about his door were quickly forgotten as his stomach growled at him, and he rushed out into the apartment, salivating.

Lily was in high spirits this morning, despite herself. She felt good about today. She thought she should feel guilty about what she did last night, but she didn't. Fact is, she felt damn near elated. ""Good morning, sunshine."" She called cheerily to Nicholas, as he walked out of his room, rubbing his face.

""Is that... breakfast?"" he asked, his voice slightly hoarse in the early morning.

""Mhm. I woke up a bit early, so I decided to make us a little something as a 'happy first day as roomies' sort of deal. Hope you're a fan of bacon and eggs..."" she answered, placing two plates on the small table.

""I am American, aren't I?"" Nick eagerly grabbed his fork and began shoveling food in his mouth. Lily shook her head in amusement before sitting across from him. They ate in silence, the sounds of the clinking silverware and the birds outside filling the small apartment. As Nick finished the last of his eggs, he set down his fork and looked up at Lily, quizzically. ""Hey... did you come in my room last night? My door was open when I woke up.""

Lily froze, her fork halfway from the plate to her mouth. Her previously cheerful spirits came crashing down around her, almost immediately. Nervously, her mind spiraled, racing to think of an excuse or reason she'd have to go into his room, ideally a reason that wouldn't end up with his door being locked from here on out. ""Uh... yeah. You know what? When I started making eggs, I had checked in to see if you were awake and if you wanted some. I guess I forgot to close it afterward; my bad, dude."" Lily shrugged nonchalantly, looking down at her plate as she stirred her eggs around her plate. As she talked, her eyes searched Nicholas' face for a sign, any sign, of doubt or concern. He just nodded and shrugged it off, however.

""Oh, okay, no problem. Thanks for making breakfast, by the way. If you're not careful, I'll start expecting it."" He joked as he ran the plate under the kitchen faucet and placing it in the dishwasher.

""Fat chance, buddy. If anyone's going to be doing the housework here, it'll be you. I'll make your ass wear a maid outfit while you do it, too."" Lily laughed as she shot back. Nick did not laugh, however. He turned away from her, but before his face left her view, she saw his eyes grow in shock and his cheeks grow beet-red. Despite herself, Lily did her best to suppress a knowing smile.

""Uh... y-yeah, sure. I'll be in my room if you need anything."" As his door closed, Lily swore under her breath.

Damnit, Lily. Be cool, you're going to freak him out.

She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts. She had been careless, leaving his door open. She could've sworn she closed it, but she left his room last night in such a haze, she wasn't surprised she left it open.

Well, no more. That was the last time something like that happens.

Even as she promised herself she wouldn't, she knew damn well she had no intentions of stopping.

I could make a move on him... but he's skittish enough that I wouldn't put it past him to bolt the second I show him interest.

No more slip-ups.

Her thoughts were interrupted as Nick's door opened and he walked out. He walked past her into the kitchen and grabbed a rag, running it under the water before turning and heading back to his room. As he passed Lily, he shrugged, confused. ""My chair's all sticky, smells funny, too. I guess I must've spilled something on it when I was moving."" Lily pictured herself last night, leaning back in his chair, as she furiously ran her fingers over herself; as she cried out, cumming around her fingers.

Shit. Starting...now.

Nick scrubbed the chair vigorously. Whatever he had spilt last night had been sticky, and had a familiar scent, one he couldn't place. He cautiously sniffed his chair, but whatever he had smelled was gone now. He dropped the rag into his laundry bin before going into his closet and grabbing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt with some indie band's faded logo on the front.

Okay, not to self- no more soda, energy drinks or food by my computer.

Nicholas knew full damn well he had no plans to amend such behavior. Oh well, it's thought that counts, right? ""Hey, Lily! I'm going to meet up with Emily. Need anything from the store while I'm out?""

As Nick's car slowed to a stop at the red light, he scanned over the laundry list of items Lily had handed him. Half of the list consisted of various smoke and beer brands, some of which he didn't even recognize. Then there were the frozen pizzas, energy drinks, candy and baked goods. Nick chuckled to himself, shaking his head in amusement as the light turned green.

It's like living with a goddamn frat party all condensed into one woman.

""So?""

Nick looked over the menu once more, ignoring Emily's prodding for the time being. ""I, like, just ate. It'd be weird to get, like, a BLT or something, right?"" Emily didn't respond to his attempt at a diversion, and instead continued to stare at the back of the menu where Nick's head was. As he tentatively peeked over the top of the menu at her, she just arched an eyebrow in his direction.

""So...?"" Nick prompted, laying down the menu. He wrapped his hands around the warm cup of tea, heating his hands in brisk autumn morning. Emily and Nick just stared each other. While Emily was slightly annoyed at Nick's avoidance of her interrogations, Nicholas was in quite the humorous mood at her irritated state, something that only made her more exasperated, which Nick found even funnier. This cycle of amusement and irritations was not an uncommon occurrence between the two friends, much to Emily's annoyance.

""So, how did yesterday go? Don't act like you don't know what I'm asking! How are the two of you... getting along?"" Emily asked, praying that her fears about the two roommates wasn't obvious from her question.

""I don't know, Emily. Fine, I guess? It's been less than twenty-four hours, you know. Ask me in, like, a week."" Nicholas laughed. Emily rolled her eyes dramatically, but dropped it. ""What about you, then. What did you do yesterday?"" Nick asked, holding the tea to his lips as his eyes locked with Emily's.

After a second of hesitation, she lowered them to the floor as the events of her previous night replayed in her head. What would happen if she just said it? How would he react? As soon as that thought formed in her mind, she dispelled it. She knew how he would take that. He would be freaked, and their friendship shattered. ""Fine.""

Nick paused, his eyes past her, unfocused as he tried to process her answer. ""What? Emily, I asked what you did yesterday."" Nick couldn't help but laugh as Emily tried to recover but just rambled incoherently, flustered. ""Em, something tells me you need to sleep more.""

The duo let the discussion of yesterday's events slip as their conversation drifted to other topics, and memories of years long ago. However, the memory of their morning meeting played repeatedly over in Emily's head as she drove back. She resisted the urge to bury her face in her hands from embarrassment as she pulled to a stop outside her apartment. ""What did I do yesterday? Hmm... Why I think I just watched a bit of tv before bed. Why, nothing worth mentioning at all, Nick!"" Emily hit her head against her steering wheel, groaning to her empty car.

""What did you do yesterday?"" ""Fine."" Gah, I'm such an idiot!

Emily paused before taking out her phone. Unlocking it, her phone opened up to the last opened page she had, an advice article from some blog. It was one of those advice blogs where readers would send in questions to some anonymous writer, and then she'd give some surface level relationship advice. What kind of idiot even buys into this type of shallow writing?!

Hey Ms. Quinn, long time reader, first time writer.

I have had this crush on my friend for as many years as I can remember, but I haven't worked up the courage to tell him. In a few days, he's moving in with this girl. Not like a relationship thing, but as roommates. I can't decide whether or not to tell him how I feel, since I feel like he'd think it'd be weird his lifelong friend has had a crush on him and never said anything. I'm worried if I don't do anything soon, it'll be too late. What do I do?!

Em

Hey there, Em, thanks for writing in!

You're absolutely right. When this boy moves in with his roommate, they'll be in close quarters constantly! Whether or not he knows or plans for it, something will be brewing between the two. Trust me, it's perfectly normal to have a crush on someone for so long without telling them, fear of rejection is universally human! The best thing to do is to take your friend somewhere nice and casual, like a coffee shop, and tell them how you feel! You're at a crossroads now, Em, and you very well may be running out of time to confess your feelings, now that your crush is moving in with another girl!

I believe you'll do the right thing,

Ms. Quinn.

Emily groaned again as she bashed her head into the steering wheel.

I'm such an idiot! Why didn't I say anything?! He was right there, it was perfect!

Emily turned and stared out the window of her car, distant as her mind wandered.

Fuck it? Fuck it.

Emily put her car in reverse and backed out of her driveway. Better late than never.

""Is that it for you today?""

Nick looked down at the list once more. ""Yeah... I think so. Wait, do you have any sleeping pills? I'm out of them again."" The older man peered at Nicholas from behind the counter.

""Didn't you hear? You now need a prescription from a doctor to get your specific pills. Those are some strong knockout drugs, sonny. You can take these, though."" Mr. Lambert passed a bottle over to Nick.

As Nick turned the bottle in his hands, his expression soured a little. These were relaxers, not sleeping pills. Ah, well. Anything is better than nothing, right? And who knows, maybe it'll have a placebo effect?

I'm like 90% sure the placebo effect doesn't work if you know it's a placebo, dumbass. Ah, fuck it.

Nicholas thanked Mr. Lambert. As Nick ran through the list of errands before him, he groaned in frustration. It was a Saturday, after all, and something told him he wouldn't get home for a while now.

Lily grunted as she lifted the dumbbell over her head one last time. With a sigh, she dropped it to the ground and reached for a towel, swiping at her forehead and arms.

Not bad for today.

Her thoughts, and workout routine, were interrupted by a knock at the door. Lily opened the door to find an extremely nervous looking young woman at the door. ""Yes?""

The girl jumped and yelped a little, backpedaling a step or two before regaining her composure. ""Oh, is... is Nicholas here? I'm... uh... a friend. So, is he... here?""

Lily didn't answer for a second, instead her eyes scanned up and down the young woman.

Alright, good. I wasn't expecting this, but... Better sooner than later, right? Let's just take care of this, then.

Lily almost felt bad for what she was about to do. ""No, he's out picking up some stuff for me. He's bound to be back soon, though. You can come inside and wait for him, though.""

Emily took another step back. ""Ohhhh... no. That's okay. I'll just..."" She yelped in surprise again as Lily's arm shot out and grabbed her hand.

""Oh, nonsense. I'd hate for you to come out all this way for nothing. Come on in, make yourself at home."" Lily insisted, as she dragged Emily inside. Emily stood in the middle of the living room awkwardly, pretending to read through the titles of different novels arranged on a bookcase. Meanwhile, Lily stood in the kitchen, busying her hands with dishes as she eyed Emily with a hungry, aggressive gaze, as if the young girl was an unsuspecting prey in the den of a predator. Truth be told, that was probably more accurate than Lily was comfortable with admitting to.

""So, tell me. How do you know Nick?"" Lily asked, finally breaking the tense silence. Emily turned, looking at Lily with wide eyes.

Christ, this girl's really is skittish, isn't she? "".... good.""

""Oh. We've been... friends for years now."" Emily offered weakly. ""You must be Lily, then?"" Emily knew exactly who she was, but for some reason, she felt that it was more polite to not know.

""Yeah. You must be the famous Emily, I'm guessing?"" Lily responded. Instantly, Emily's face lit up with delight.

""Nick's talked about me?!""

Fuckin' hell, that's it.

Lily stood up straight, wiping her hands on her jeans before slowly, methodically walking into the living room towards Emily. Emily instinctually began to slowly back up as Lily approached, her retreat completely unnoticed to herself, although not going unseen by Lily. Emily gasped as her back hit the wall unexpectedly, Lily now standing over her, glaring down at the smaller woman. ""So, you're friends with Nick, is that it?"" Emily opened her mouth to speak but no sounds came out.

Instead, she just nodded weakly as she stared, paralyzed, by Lily's intensely burning blue eyes. ""You ever fucked the boy?"" Emily, though shocked by Lily's forward and crass questioning, could feel her head shake against her will. Lily smirked at her answer. ""But you want to, don't you?"" Try as she might, Emily could not stop herself from nodding, her face now burning with shame and humiliation.

Lily didn't respond at first. Instead, she reached up, wrapping her hands around Emily's throat. Emily found herself standing on her toes, shaking, terrified, but unable to tear her eyes away from Lily. ""Here's the deal, girl. You're going to give Ol' Nick a wide berth. Because if you don't, I WILL find out, I WILL find you, and I WILL punish you. He's mine. We clear?"" Emily struggled, nodding desperately.

""Good girl."" Lily released Emily. The smaller woman collapsed, grasping for breath, and shaking uncontrollably.

""Now... go."" Lily walked towards the door and opened it. Emily stumbled to her feet and walked towards the door in a motion that wasn't entirely hers to control. Emily's eyes stayed locked on the floor as she felt Lily pierce her with an icy gaze as she passed her. Emily flinched as the door slammed shut behind her. As Emily drove home, she gripped the wheel with whitened knuckles, mind blank as she stared straight ahead towards home in silence.

Lily sat on the couch and flipped on the tv. While she had a nasty pit in her stomach, she felt a hint of elation that comes with a victory, with winning a prize, or defeating an opponent. It was something she had felt before, but only in sports or from fights, never from a guy.

Interesting.

A few hours later, the door opened as Nick shuffled in, bags in each arm.

""Slow down there, cowboy. Let me help."" Lily scooped an armful of brown paper bags from Nick's arms. Shrugging off his protests, she placed the rest of the bags on the counter. Nick and Lily shared a dinner and had some conversation about something, something Lily couldn't remember and didn't particularly care to. Fact is, she was still riding the high from scaring off the competition a few hours before. As Nick talked about some show, he was oblivious as Lily's eyes traveled up and down his body, hungrily sizing him up.

She knew it wasn't right, but her encounter didn't help in dissuading Lily's feeling that Nicholas was hers. She just needed to convince him of such.

Something that should be easy enough to do.

Lily broke off that thought there, knowing that her train of thought was a dangerous one.

But that thought wasn't gone. It stayed with her deep into the night. Lily sighed and pulled her sheets off of herself and lightly walked to Nick's room. There he was, dead asleep as usual, a bottle of pills by his bedside. She pulled his chair out from his desk and sat down, undoing the ties around her pajama bottoms. Lily leaned her head back, resting it against the leather chair, as her fingers pushed past her panties and began to explore. She moaned freely and loudly as her fingers began to rub her clit, as they began to tease and toy with her, pushing inside, filling her. She moaned and whimpered as she thrust her fingers inside, lifting her head to gaze upon the beautiful sleeping boy before her... and locked eyes with Nick.

There were a few seconds of silence as the two stared at each other. ""...The pills?"" Lily finally stammered.

""I ran out. Had to get relaxers instead."" Nick mumbled quietly.

""Oh."" Lily said. More silence followed as the two stared at each other.

""...What-?"" Nick started, but Lily cut him off.

""Wait, just... wait."" Lily stood, removing her hand. She slowly walked towards the bed.

Well, it's now or never.

Nick had half-pushed himself up off the bed, but Lily placed her hand on his shoulder, pushing him back down. Nick relented, staring wide-eyed up at her.

""I know how you feel about me. You aren't exactly the most subtle boy I've met, you know. Trust me, it's a mutual feeling. Now, if you want, I can go. Tomorrow, we can talk about the breach of trust I have done, and see if you want me gone. But if you want me, you just need to ask, and I'll take you right here, right now."" Nick opened his mouth, but couldn't seem to find the words.

Lily placed a finger on his lips. ""I know you're nervous. If you want me, just nod."" Nick hesitated before nodding. Lily leaned down and brushed her lips against his. Nick quickly reached up and rested his hand on the back of her head as her tongue found its way past his lips. As she kissed him, she pulled his shorts down, before removing her own bottoms. Carefully, she mounted him, as moan escaped from Nick's mouth, muffled by her lips.

Lily pushed herself upright as she began to thrust her hips. Nick moaned out her name as he placed his hands on her hips and moved against Lily. He closed his eyes as he moaned in bliss, lost in a pleasure he had never felt before. Lily grunted as she pounded herself onto Nick's cock over and over again, harder and harder. Her body glistened with sweat as she sank down onto him over and over. Removing her top, she tossed it to the side and grabbed Nick's hands. She placed them onto her tits as Nick's fingers began to massage and pinch. Lily cried out as she began to feel a warm tingling spread throughout her body, slowly boiling up inside of her, and threating to burst with a fiery, orgasmic intensity.

Looking down, she could see Nick was getting close himself. Any ability to speak he might've had had slipped away long ago, as he grunted and moaned, thrusting up into her. All he could do was hang on as Lily rode him for all he was worth, fucking herself onto his cock relentlessly until Nicholas cried out in ecstasy, leaning up and wrapping his arms around Lily as he erupted, a warm embrace of pleasure enthralling the two. Lily wrapped her fingers in Nick's hair as her legs shook and she quivered against Nick as that boiling, growing heat finally burst, spreading throughout her body and fully dominating her mind.

Alright, good. I wasn't expecting this, but... Better sooner than later, right? Let's just take care of this, then.

Lily almost felt bad for what she was about to do. ""No, he's out picking up some stuff for me. He's bound to be back soon, though. You can come inside and wait for him, though.""

Emily took another step back. ""Ohhhh... no. That's okay. I'll just..."" She yelped in surprise again as Lily's arm shot out and grabbed her hand.

""Oh, nonsense. I'd hate for you to come out all this way for nothing. Come on in, make yourself at home."" Lily insisted, as she dragged Emily inside. Emily stood in the middle of the living room awkwardly, pretending to read through the titles of different novels arranged on a bookcase. Meanwhile, Lily stood in the kitchen, busying her hands with dishes as she eyed Emily with a hungry, aggressive gaze, as if the young girl was an unsuspecting prey in the den of a predator. Truth be told, that was probably more accurate than Lily was comfortable with admitting to.

""So, tell me. How do you know Nick?"" Lily asked, finally breaking the tense silence. Emily turned, looking at Lily with wide eyes.

Christ, this girl's really is skittish, isn't she? "".... good.""

""Oh. We've been... friends for years now."" Emily offered weakly. ""You must be Lily, then?"" Emily knew exactly who she was, but for some reason, she felt that it was more polite to not know.

""Yeah. You must be the famous Emily, I'm guessing?"" Lily responded. Instantly, Emily's face lit up with delight.

""Nick's talked about me?!""

Fuckin' hell, that's it.

Lily stood up straight, wiping her hands on her jeans before slowly, methodically walking into the living room towards Emily. Emily instinctually began to slowly back up as Lily approached, her retreat completely unnoticed to herself, although not going unseen by Lily. Emily gasped as her back hit the wall unexpectedly, Lily now standing over her, glaring down at the smaller woman. ""So, you're friends with Nick, is that it?"" Emily opened her mouth to speak but no sounds came out.

Instead, she just nodded weakly as she stared, paralyzed, by Lily's intensely burning blue eyes. ""You ever fucked the boy?"" Emily, though shocked by Lily's forward and crass questioning, could feel her head shake against her will. Lily smirked at her answer. ""But you want to, don't you?"" Try as she might, Emily could not stop herself from nodding, her face now burning with shame and humiliation.

Lily didn't respond at first. Instead, she reached up, wrapping her hands around Emily's throat. Emily found herself standing on her toes, shaking, terrified, but unable to tear her eyes away from Lily. ""Here's the deal, girl. You're going to give Ol' Nick a wide berth. Because if you don't, I WILL find out, I WILL find you, and I WILL punish you. He's mine. We clear?"" Emily struggled, nodding desperately.

""Good girl."" Lily released Emily. The smaller woman collapsed, grasping for breath, and shaking uncontrollably.

""Now... go."" Lily walked towards the door and opened it. Emily stumbled to her feet and walked towards the door in a motion that wasn't entirely hers to control. Emily's eyes stayed locked on the floor as she felt Lily pierce her with an icy gaze as she passed her. Emily flinched as the door slammed shut behind her. As Emily drove home, she gripped the wheel with whitened knuckles, mind blank as she stared straight ahead towards home in silence.

Lily sat on the couch and flipped on the tv. While she had a nasty pit in her stomach, she felt a hint of elation that comes with a victory, with winning a prize, or defeating an opponent. It was something she had felt before, but only in sports or from fights, never from a guy.

Interesting.

A few hours later, the door opened as Nick shuffled in, bags in each arm.

""Slow down there, cowboy. Let me help."" Lily scooped an armful of brown paper bags from Nick's arms. Shrugging off his protests, she placed the rest of the bags on the counter. Nick and Lily shared a dinner and had some conversation about something, something Lily couldn't remember and didn't particularly care to. Fact is, she was still riding the high from scaring off the competition a few hours before. As Nick talked about some show, he was oblivious as Lily's eyes traveled up and down his body, hungrily sizing him up.

She knew it wasn't right, but her encounter didn't help in dissuading Lily's feeling that Nicholas was hers. She just needed to convince him of such.

Something that should be easy enough to do.

Lily broke off that thought there, knowing that her train of thought was a dangerous one.

But that thought wasn't gone. It stayed with her deep into the night. Lily sighed and pulled her sheets off of herself and lightly walked to Nick's room. There he was, dead asleep as usual, a bottle of pills by his bedside. She pulled his chair out from his desk and sat down, undoing the ties around her pajama bottoms. Lily leaned her head back, resting it against the leather chair, as her fingers pushed past her panties and began to explore. She moaned freely and loudly as her fingers began to rub her clit, as they began to tease and toy with her, pushing inside, filling her. She moaned and whimpered as she thrust her fingers inside, lifting her head to gaze upon the beautiful sleeping boy before her... and locked eyes with Nick.

There were a few seconds of silence as the two stared at each other. ""...The pills?"" Lily finally stammered.

""I ran out. Had to get relaxers instead."" Nick mumbled quietly.

""Oh."" Lily said. More silence followed as the two stared at each other.

""...What-?"" Nick started, but Lily cut him off.

""Wait, just... wait."" Lily stood, removing her hand. She slowly walked towards the bed.

Well, it's now or never.

Nick had half-pushed himself up off the bed, but Lily placed her hand on his shoulder, pushing him back down. Nick relented, staring wide-eyed up at her.

""I know how you feel about me. You aren't exactly the most subtle boy I've met, you know. Trust me, it's a mutual feeling. Now, if you want, I can go. Tomorrow, we can talk about the breach of trust I have done, and see if you want me gone. But if you want me, you just need to ask, and I'll take you right here, right now."" Nick opened his mouth, but couldn't seem to find the words.

Lily placed a finger on his lips. ""I know you're nervous. If you want me, just nod."" Nick hesitated before nodding. Lily leaned down and brushed her lips against his. Nick quickly reached up and rested his hand on the back of her head as her tongue found its way past his lips. As she kissed him, she pulled his shorts down, before removing her own bottoms. Carefully, she mounted him, as moan escaped from Nick's mouth, muffled by her lips.

Lily pushed herself upright as she began to thrust her hips. Nick moaned out her name as he placed his hands on her hips and moved against Lily. He closed his eyes as he moaned in bliss, lost in a pleasure he had never felt before. Lily grunted as she pounded herself onto Nick's cock over and over again, harder and harder. Her body glistened with sweat as she sank down onto him over and over. Removing her top, she tossed it to the side and grabbed Nick's hands. She placed them onto her tits as Nick's fingers began to massage and pinch. Lily cried out as she began to feel a warm tingling spread throughout her body, slowly boiling up inside of her, and threating to burst with a fiery, orgasmic intensity.

Looking down, she could see Nick was getting close himself. Any ability to speak he might've had had slipped away long ago, as he grunted and moaned, thrusting up into her. All he could do was hang on as Lily rode him for all he was worth, fucking herself onto his cock relentlessly until Nicholas cried out in ecstasy, leaning up and wrapping his arms around Lily as he erupted, a warm embrace of pleasure enthralling the two. Lily wrapped her fingers in Nick's hair as her legs shook and she quivered against Nick as that boiling, growing heat finally burst, spreading throughout her body and fully dominating her mind.",,2025-08-15T18:51:04.654031,3526,2.0

Chapter 33

""Yeah, okay. Why not,"" Lucy responds, in the most casually compliant, yet somehow personally fitting manner possible.

At first I think she didn't understand Master's proposal, but no, she makes it quite clear that she understands what he he means to do. Lucy has a lot of character flaws. Like, a lot. But being stupid isn't actually one of them.

""I'm glad we're all on the same page, then,"" Master says, being a little too trusting that Lucy is actually going along with this, if I'm being honest.

""Wait, wait,"" I interject, ""It's just 'yeah, okay'? That's it? No objections? No schemes?""

""It's not like I'd announce it if I did have a scheme, you know. But yeah,"" she shrugs, still apparently not finding any of this important to even get up off the couch, ""What, did you expect me to do this the hard way? Sloth is one of my favorite sins. After lust, obviously. Gluttony's up there, too, but that's neither here nor there.""

""You're... just going to turn your back on your people?"" that sounded too much like I'm trying to talk her out of it. Which I'm legitimately not. Just suspicious of all this. Not that I coulld probably talk her into or out of anything she didn't want to do.

She snorts a laugh through her nose and starts giggling, ""My people. That's adorable, Lorelei. You said that so sincerely,"" she sinks further back on the couch in laughter, ""Like I'm fucking Polish or something. Literal demons from hell. I love that you think there's some sense of loyalty or ethnic pride going on.""

""Okay, fair en-"" I start, before she decides she isn't done.

""Surely I'll be despised as a traitor!"" she laughs, ""How can I ever betray my beloved homeland and countrymen like that?! Oh, to never return! What a cruel fate!""

""Are you done?"" I say, flatly.

She sits up, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye, ""I had more, but I can stop.""

Master places a hand on my head and looks down at me, ""Satisfied?""

I sigh and nod, ""For now.""

""Everyone will be over in a couple hours, we should have a light meal before we start. We all need our strength,"" Master says, before leaving us.

I turn to go to the kitchen, but Lucy stops me, ""Besides, it's a little rich for you, of all people, to suggest that I'm disloyal to my people.""

The only downside to elf ears, is that they easily give away my mood. In this case, they stand straight up.

""What's that supposed to mean?"" I turn back, sharply.

""Oh, we're gonna be coy? Lorelei doesn't know what I'm talking about. What's the word? Homophile? Anthropophile?""

""Just because I have a few videos on my computer doesn't make me-"" that one took a moment to catch up to me, ""Oh. You're referring to humans.""

""We're going to have to revist -that-,"" she snickers, ""But yeah. When were you going to do your duty for you people? Marry a nice elf boy, start ensuring a future for the elven race? Swear off human cock for good?""

My jaw sets in, ""Point. Made.""

She does seem to back off of that nonsense, thankfully, ""All this is just dancing around the real point. This means I'm finally going to get proper laid. Took him long enough. Before Lorelei, too, so bonus points.""

I take a deep breath. There's no point in getting into this with her any further. Master's cock is getting wet, and that's what's important. I don't expect she'll really understand that sentiment.

""Just make sure you're ready, okay?"" I tell her, and go to fix dinner.

I'm not out of the room before I hear footsteps after me, ""Wait, what did he mean about 'everyone' coming over, exactly?""

By 'everyone', of course, Master meant all the people in the know about Lucy. Clara and Piper, Lydia and her girls. Lucy is not enthused to learn about the catgirls coming over, but not as perturbed as I've come to expect. Maybe she's building up a tolerance.

Master apparently had kept tight wraps on this, since none of them know initially what they're here for. No, that isn't completely true. Yuki and Yuri had an inkling, which means that Lydia did, which means Clara did. No one seems to have a clear picture, though. Seems a bit silly, once Lucy completely folded to the idea, but I guess opening portals to hell is the kind of thing that one plays close to the chest. Loose lips sink entire civilizations into depravity, ruin, and eventual overrun by rapey muderfiends, so they say.

Unsurprisingly, Clara is not on board when she first hears the plan. It took little convincing for me, but in fairness, elves are not really built for saying 'no' to humans. Clara has no such biological predispositions, and so the argument stretches over an hour before he's able to assuage her fears enough that we can proceed tonight. I guess the whole 'corruption by hell' risk is eventually outweighed by the definitiveness of Master's penis being inside Lucy. She's still a bit iffy on the whole thing, but she seems to accept that she isn't changing his mind on this.

Meanwhile, Yuri gives me the constant googly eyes, while pretending she's doing nothing of the sort, and Lucy does everything in her power to make Piper as uncomfortable as possible. He doesn't stop entertaining her attention at any point, though. It's possible that he thinks he's got some chance with her, on some level, at some point. Which I guess is a big deal to a domestic elf boy, since he's not exactly fated to fuck anyone, ever. I won't say she doesn't have sexual interest in him, because she has sexual interest in everyone. Succubus and all. But I don't think Lucy has designs on any of the activities he might be thinking of.

Once we've eaten, and I've done my best to ensure Master has enough energy to be prepared for the coming trial, he wastes no time with us moving upstairs. At which point Lucy immediately disrobes in front of everyone, without him even asking her. She's very much an attention whore, in addition to being the regular kind. That's probably why she was wearing clothes to begin with, now that I think of it.

I hide a giggle at her frustration that Master is the only one who doesn't give her a second glance. Amazing as her body might be, it's sort of old news at this point, and Master is not easily manipulated by a little T&A.

""I will need you all to keep her in place as best as you can. She needs to stay within the circle as much as possible. Any part of her extending out causes disruption,"" he explains, ""I'd use chains, but anchoring them in the circle would get in the way of the runes, and anchoring them outside would present its own problem with interference from connecting her directily to the outside of the circle. I won't go into the minutia of why it's a problem, but suffice to say, the chains aren't feasible.""

""Do we have to stay entirely within the circle as well?"" Clara asks, which is actually a good question, ""If we're touching her, and touching the outside of the circle, doesn't that connect her?""

""Being your own living being nullifies the magicial conductivity, so that shouldn't be a problem,"" he says, ""Again, kind of complicated reasons that you don't really need to worry yourselves with. But that does mean you'll all need to be nude. Clothes could interfere. Which reminds me...""

Master steps over, produces a key, and unlocks the chastity belt concealing Lucy's nethers. The look of intense relief on her face is as palpable as the schadenfreude I get when she immediately reaches to her crotch, only to be denied by the magic barriers still in place.

""No chastity belts, either, just to be safe,"" Master says.

I won't go over in great detail about Clara walking up and disrobing Piper. And I won't go into great detail about how I almost laughed when I saw his genitals freed from their cage. That would be almost mean spirited, to dwell on that.

""Can't you just, I don't know... magic her to the floor?"" Lydia asks, ""Being a... how did you put it, Lucy? A motherfucking sorcerer?"" She and Lucy share a chuckle over that. I just remember being mortified when she blurted that out in the library.

""Technically, yes,"" Master says, taking Lucy by the hand and leading her to the center of the circle, ""At least, at any other time. This is going to require me to dispel the minor wards I put on her, as they could interfere. Binding her to the floor would be effectively the same thing. We can't have it active during the ritual.""

He promptly puts to fingers to Lucy's forehead, and there is a crackle of magic energy released. Which I'm not actually sure humans can hear, but that's not important right now. The most noticeable change is that Lucy's feet immediately change back into hooves. She gets a tiny bit taller, her tail gets longer, and a few other minor changes. Presumably, we're seeing her true form. Must be nice to be able to change your appearance so easily. To my surprise, her breasts actually get bigger, not a lot, but it does mean that she shrunk them a little, tailoring to what she believed were Master's specific tastes. Which is weird, because they were still huge, if you ask me.

The change she notices, however, is not purely physical. Which she displays by immediately reaching between her legs to rub her fingers over her pussy.

""Oh, hello, old frie-"" she's interupted by Master slapping her hands away.

""No. That's mine tonight,"" he states, in a very factual sort of way.

""Starting with the romance, already?"" she smirks.

He doesn't respond, just turns back to face the rest of us, and begins unbuttoning his shirt, ""I'll need to beging the ritual with us all on the outside, with her standing upright in the smaller inner circle,"" he says, gesturing to where he means, ""Once I'm ready, I'll enter the circle and push her to the ground. That will be the cue for the rest of you to enter the circle and hold her limbs down. Hell will attempt to force her will, and do what it can to disrupt the ritual. Lucy is stronger than she looks, but all of us together should be able to keep her pinned while I pacify her.""

""That is, by far, the nerdiest way of explaining how we're going to gang rape a demon, that I can possibly imagine,"" Clara tells him, stifling a laugh. I thought it was sexy, personally.

""It's not really rape, exactly. Lucy herself is into it, it's hell that will be trying to force her to stop it. It's only rape in the sense that I'm raping hell, itself,"" he says, quite seriously.

""Nerdy -and- sexy, that time,"" she smiles and kisses his cheek.

""Okay, so I'm thinking, a woman on each arm, and two little ones per leg,"" he taps his chin, ""While the legs -are- stronger, I don't want to leave the little ones on arms - Lucy has busy fingers, so you'll need more strength than just weight to hold her in place. With them sitting on the legs, it should provide more weight than a human woman. Oh, and girls, er, and Piper - try to keep her legs spread as much as you can, and focus your weight on her thighs. It'll make access easier, and make it harder for her to struggle.""

Yuri is immediately at my side, crowding me. I'm a little annoyed by the continued obsession again, until I realize that sharing one of Lucy's legs with her means I don't have to do it with Piper. Sorry, Yuki. I do make sure to be positioned so that I'll be behind her when we start, rather than the reverse. We need focus, I can't have her clinging to me.

""Are we ready?"" Master asks, looking at the assembled group. Clothes start coming off.

Master's accent is terrible. I think. I don't actually know for certain what hellspeak is supposed to sound like, but this sounds off. The only one here that can even read hellscript is Yuri, and I have no idea if she can speak it properly, either. Considering her struggle with pronouncing English words, my guess is no. Oh, and I guess Lucy would know it, too. Probably.

He finishes the initial incantation and nothing happens. I assume that he's gotten it wrong. Said the words wrong or butchered the pronunciation. Or maybe the spell was never real to begin with. It wouldn't be the first time a crazy person wrote a book on spells that was nonsense.

Just as I'm about to ask Master if everything is alright, Lucy's eyes light up like the sun. And the circle on the floor. And her nipples, for some reason, which honestly seems excessive and unnecessary, if you ask me. She says something in hellspeak, which confirms that Master is awful at speaking it. The words have the weird echoing, booming voice thing. Which would have more impact if Lucy hadn't used that same voice to try to intimidate me into illicit sexual activities or getting her food. The glowy stuff is new, though. I don't think it's her talking, really. Weird echoey voice or no, it sounds too... I don't know, focused, to be her.

Master holds his hand up and closes his eyes in a look of concentration. Lucy says something else in hellspeak, and starts laughing like a supervillain, but suddenly stops and gasps like she's had the wind knocked out of her, leaning over with her hands on her knees. The glow vanishes from her eyes and nippless, but not the circle. He did explain what was going to happen, but you can't ravish an elf like he did this morning and expect her to remember anything you told her right before that. So I'm sort of lost on how things are progressing.

It does seem positive, though, as Master finally steps into the circle. He grabs Lucy tightly by the neck, pulls her close and kisses her hard. Tongue, too. I'm almost certain. When his lips part, he lifts her up by the neck and throws her down in the middle of the circle, on her back. If that was me, that would have hurt quite a lot, but Lucy is certainly fine. And I'm soaked, but I think that goes without saying. Master being sexually aggressive makes me a bit weak, if that wasn't clear, by now.

I almost forget what I'm supposed to be doing. It takes Yuri tugging my hand forward to snap me back. Everyone is advancing on Lucy, and I remember that we're supposed to be pinning her down. Not that she's really doing much resisting - I think Master may have put the forces of hell at bay or something, because Lucy seems entirely in charge of her faculties, and we all know Lucy is not about resistance to sex. Still, knowing that could change at any moment, I help Yuri pull her right thigh out, and we both straddle over top of it. Yuri actually seems fascinated by the whole affair, and looks particularly eager at the prospect of Master putting his cock in Lucy. I knew she'd come around, I'm actually kind of proud of her.

Clara shoots me a little smile as she pins the arm on the same side, and Lydia does the same to the other, while Yuki and Piper are busy helping us spread her legs. Wisely, Yuki has made sure to sit behind Piper to keep his elf cock where it belongs, namely, away from pussy of any kind.

""Are we doing this, or not?"" Lucy exclaims, practically quiver, her eyes glued to Master's cock.

It feels a little silly that we're holding her down. Master places a hand against her stomach, and a series of runes on the floor that surround her body flash, then fade out.

""Lucy..."" then he says something that I don't think I could reproduce with my mouth, much less spell, which might or might not be Lucy's true name, ""...Do you vow to reject the domination of hell, and bound yourself to my will and soul?""

""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" she almost growls, ""Less talking, more fucking!""

At this point, the pinning is basically keeping her from jumping on him. Her pussy, drenched I might add, is practically gravitating towards him.

He rakes his fingers along her stomach and leans in, ""Then, in defiance to hell, I claim this demon as my own.""

With that, he finally does it. He presses the head of his cock to her practically quivering entrance, and rams it home. All in one thrust. No easing it in, here. Months of foreplay have made that unnecessary. Her juices practically overflow as he fills her. And by the Earth Mother is that a snug fit. I never really gave it too much thought, since everything's been focused on not putting anything in Lucy's pussy, but it looks so amazingly tight. For a moment, I try to convince myself that there's no way it's really -that- tight, and my little elf pussy could easily match it. But who am I kidding. There's no way I can compete with succubus pussy. And I'm not sure I'd want to. I'd never dream of handling a human cock if I was so tight. That it's Lucy and pain doesn't seem to have the same effect as us mere mortals, is the only thing that allows her to do it. I shiver just watching.

She doesn't. 'Shiver' wouldn't cover it. More like whole body convulsions. Her back arch, her head and eyes roll back, her hips buck wildly, and she screams like a banshee (I would know, my cousin is a banshee). She is totally, unmistakably cumming. I can almost see her pussy pulse around Master's cock. It must feel so good for him. Normally, I'd disapprove of such flagrant orgasming by a non-human, but I doubt she'd be able to help it, even if she wanted to. And I can assure you, she doesn't.

It goes on for awhile. She's... pretty pent up. I think I can relate, but then, I'm not a succubus. Master starts thrusting a little, or tries too. It seems like with her spasming pussy clenching down on him, he can hardly move. When she finally subsides from seizing like she's being electrocuted, to merely bucking against him like a wild animal, he stops and leans in placing his palm against her forhead and whispers something softly, which I can't quite make out. I doubt it was in English, anyways. There's some sort of discharge of energy between the two of them, and she stiffens up and collapses back.

Master... he gets this strange look in his eyes. They aren't glowing like Lucy's were, but there's this strange shine to them, an intense, animalistic look of seething energy. It takes me a moment, but I realize this must be what he was talking about when he said he'd redirect infernal energy to help him pacify her. I'm not sure I like this, but it's far too late to object, now.

Lucy herself has an expression of, well, not quite fright. Surprise, maybe. She still looks like she wants Master's cock like... the only metaphor I can think of is 'like an elf wants human cock', but that seems very lazy. Still apt, though. But she looks shocked, like he's pulled some trick on her that she never would have expected. A look of vulnerability is one that she doesn't typically wear. I dare say it's a bit cute.

It's made better by the way Master rams home immediately after it's settled on her face. I mean, he really slams it in. It makes her whole body rock back, even with the six of us putting our weight down on her. And he does it again. And again. Just as hard, and becoming faster and faster. I've never seen Master make love so aggressively, not even with Miss Clara. She could take it, I'm sure, human women are robust like that. I can't help but wonder what it would be like if he fucked me like that, jamming that big human cock of his into my little elf pussy. I bet it would practically tear me apart with the force, stretch out and wreck my pussy so that it would be no good to anyone but Master. Not that anyone else would ever get a chance at it, anyways.

And now I'm grinding on Lucy's thigh. Get it together, Lorelei. Focus. Master needs you on top of things, right now. Fortunately, Yuri doesn't seem to notice. Those big dinner plates of eyes of hers are focused quite squarely on where Master is entering Lucy. Or as best as she can, with there being so much motion.

He leans over Lucy, pressing his hands on her upper arms, though if it's to stabilize her further, I don't think it's going to change anything with the rest of us already holding her. It seems more for leverage, really, to pull on her while he fucks her little demon pussy even harder. I don't know if it changes anything, or if it's unrelated, but her eyes flash with that weird glow again, and she starts hissing that awful hellspeak again. It sounds angry, and she growls a lot and bears her teeth, but she also doesn't stop bucking her hips like a mad woman, either.",,2025-08-15T18:51:36.814275,3676,

Kristen was the only woman in the office with the audacity to wear leopard-print shoes to work, Martin knew that much for sure. Technically, they were boots, he supposed, not boots, but they stood out from the corporate uniform like a sore thumb. With five-inch heels and a platform to boot, they raised the statuesque, frosted blonde to new heights; she paired them with some black skinny pants that appeared vacuum-sealed to those long, muscular legs and sweetly-curved behind, and a white blouse that she'd left open just enough to show off a healthy volume of cleavage and occasionally the upper edge of one of her bra-cups. If anyone dared to mention the tightness of her pants or the glimpse of her lacy bra, they'd get a withering look and a sharp tongue for their trouble, not to mention their calls would mysteriously fail to reach them.

Martin, to his credit, noticed neither the prodigious swell of her tits or the sweet peachiness of her behind; a married man of a whole two weeks, he only had eyes for his high school sweetheart and brand-new wife. So, while he'd heard murmurs among the cleaning staff and other guys in the offices next door about Kristen, he didn't see the big deal. He did notice her boots, though; they were too outstanding to ignore. He saw the bold pattern and the high heel and the gold charms swinging from the brass zipper -- tiny hearts, each imprinted with ""mine.""

As far as he was concerned, she was just the oldest woman in the office -- Martin had heard that she was pushing fifty, which seemed ancient to his 25 -- and at the same time, the newest secretary. His boss, a notorious tyrant in J. Jonah Jameson style, had been through three in the last year. Kristen had only started three or four weeks ago, but already Mr. Petersen seemed happier, so everybody was a little happier.

Even his wife, Melody, seemed happier after he'd told her about Kristen. After a train of cute young girls had traipsed through the office, his loving, generous, kind -- if a little plain -- wife had relaxed visibly once she learned that the new secretary was almost as old as both of them put together!

""I'm telling you man, fucking prime MILF!""

""I don't believe you, Rodriguez. That shit doesn't happen outside of porn.""

Martin didn't look up from the briefs on his desk. Sounded like a couple of the cleaners, coming in at the end of the day to empty the garbage.

""You go down there and look for yourself, man. Five bucks says you come back with a hard on!""

Martin coughed loudly. He really didn't want to hear this shit. Mostly what he wanted was to get home to his wife before it got late. He was already in the doghouse for postponing their honeymoon to finish up the Pauling project, but the trip they could take with the bonus he was looking at would more than make up for it. He checked his watch, then looked at the clock on the phone; he picked up the receiver, just to make sure it had a dial tone. Where the hell was Pauling, anyway? The weekly teleconf was scheduled for 4:30; it was almost 5!

One of the cleaners wandered past, pushing a mop bucket. He nodded to Martin. Martin looked back at his work. Down the hall, he could hear Kristen and the cleaner talking about something, then laughing. A few moments later, the cleaner passed his office door again. He nodded. Martin ignored him.

""And?""

""Holy shit I owe you five bucks!""

""I know, right?""

""Fuck I've never seen tits like that!""

""Perfect fucking MILF tits, my friend.""

""What do you mean? Tits are tits, yo.""

""Fuck you. Don't you watch any MILF porn? Big ol' cougar tits are the way to go!""

""You'll have to hook me up after work.""

""Damn straight, son. Nothing beats fat, creamy, beautiful MILF tits; except maybe a perfect, round MILF ass.""

Martin tried to ignore them. Same damn thing every damn day. What was the big deal with MILFs, anyway? It seemed like every time he turned around, guys were all ""MILF this"" and ""MILF that."" He much preferred his young little wife: sure, sometimes she was a little reluctant about sex, and maybe she didn't always want to--

""Don't you two have anything better to do than stand around all day?"" Kristen called out from the other end of the hall; embarrassed silence followed, then hushed whispers as they wheeled their buckets back out. Heels *clacked* sharply down the hall soon after. Her face appeared around the corner, a frosted blonde mane of loose silky curls bouncing around her features.

""They bugging you, Marty?"" Some people in the office said she'd had work done, but there was sign of the tight, frozen features worn by folks who'd gone the way of Botox; a few stray lines around her eyes and mouth betrayed her age to some extent, but otherwise her skin was clear, almost translucent. Mischievous hazel eyes twinkled at him as plush, pink-glossed lips spread in a smile. Other guys in the office would stare, sometimes, not really sure what or how to address a beautiful older woman; Martin, thinking only of getting home to Melody, was too distracted to notice.

""No more than usual."" He said. Nobody had called him ""Marty"" since he was fifteen; normally he'd object, but running against Kristen's iron will struck him as a bad idea. Who cared what she called him, so long as he could get out on time?

""Let me know if they do. I'll take care of ya."" She winked at him. Martin blushed. Kristen was nice, so long as you stayed on her good side. This was true of all secretaries, but she'd been slightly nicer to him than the rest of the office. Every morning this week, he'd come in to find a steaming cup of coffee on his desk, made to order, without any input from him. Every now and again he'd find a candy or something sitting on his chair. Nothing weird, of course; she was probably just settling into the office and trying to make friends. They were both outsiders, after all; she had just come in from an outside department, and he had only started a few months beforehand. She was the oldest person in the office by (reportedly) a decade or so; he was the youngest by at least five years.

""Thanks, Kristen. I'm fine, no worries."" He gave her a slightly disingenuous smile, feeling the minutes slip past, and knowing he'd have to rush to beat the traffic. Martin checked the message light on the phone again, just in case he'd missed a ring or something.

""You look pretty worried to me,"" she said, stepping into the doorway. ""Anything I can do?""

""Are you gonna be here for a while?"" He checked his watch again.

""Here til six, probably.""

""Can you keep an eye out and text me if Emil Pauling calls? I've gotta get out of here.""

""Heading home to the little woman?""

""Yeah. Do you mind?""

""Not a problem, Marty."" Kristen winked at him.

""Thanks!"" Martin practically leapt out of his chair, and hastily scribbled his number on a post-it. ""Here's my cell. Don't tell Petersen you have it or he won't give me a minute's peace.""

""He won't hear it from me. It'll be our little secret, I promise.""

""Thanks, Kristen. I really appreciate this. I owe you one"" Martin swept some papers hastily into his briefcase. ""Nice kicks, by the way.""

""Why thank you , Marty,"" she gushed. ""Sucking up to me will get you everywhere.""

Martin laughed. ""Don't let Melody hear you say that. She gets kinda jealous.""

""Sounds like somebody not as secure as she'd like to be."" Kristen winked again. ""It's our little secret. Have a good night, Marty.""

""You too."" He grabbed his case and his jacket, letting the jab at Melody slide. ""See you tomorrow.""

*

His phone didn't buzz on the way out of the building. It stayed silent on the drive home. There was nothing during dinner, or while he did the dishes, either. It wasn't until after he and Melody had curled up together on the couch

Scrambling, he yanked his phone out of his pocket.

**hey marty its kris**

**just fyi no call from pauling**

Martin cursed under his breath. Pauling lived about four and a half hours to the east -- it was way late over there. There was no call coming tonight, which would mean a long day tomorrow trying to sort shit.

""You okay babe?"" Melody asked; she was snuggled up comfortably in thick fleece PJs. Enormous stylized pigs leered out at him from the fabric.

""Yeah."" He ran his hand through his hair. ""This Pauling thing is gonna take longer than I expected, I think.""

He thumbed a response to Kristen. **Dammit. :-( Thanks. I appreciate the heads up**

Melody pouted and got off the couch. ""We're never going to have a damn honeymoon at this rate."" She walked away, towards the bedroom; Martin was about to follow when his phone buzzed again.

**no prob bob**

He stood up, turned to flick his phone on the couch and it went off again.

**what u doing?**

**Nothing, just hanging out.**

**with the little lady?**

**not anymore**

**oh. can I ask a quick q?**

**Sure. I owe you one anyway.**

**I need ur opinion on something.**

**Ask away.**

**got a date tmrw with a dude about your age. think he'd like?**

What followed was a slightly grainy mobile phone picture. Ostensibly, it was a photo of a shoe: it was peach, with a towering heel, a subtle platform and a lacy mesh covering from peep-toe to ankle. Most of the picture was dominated by a long sweep of creamy white skin from upper thigh to pink-painted toes. For a moment, all he could do was stare at that long, gorgeous leg; all unblemished skin and smooth muscle with nary a hint of cellulite. Even Melody was starting to show signs of the stuff, and she still hadn't hit the second half of her 20s!

He stared, then closed the text conversation, heart pounding. What if Melody had seen that? What was he doing? He hadn't even looked at any pornography in three months out of respect for his new spouse -- not that he'd ever been a great consumer of smut -- he definitely shouldn't be looking at a co-worker's gams!

The phone vibrated again.

**well?** Appeared on the lock screen.

*Well, your legs are magnificent,* ran briefly through his mind. With a disgusted noise, Martin threw the phone down on the couch, and went after Melody.

*

""Hey Marty, you never answered my question,"" Kirsten complained over the phone the next day, just as Martin was thinking about lunch.

""Yeah, well I'm not sure it was an appropriate question to ask somebody you work with."" he replied testily, not looking up from the Pauling stuff.

""Sorry Marty, I didn't realize. You didn't get in trouble with the little missus, did you?""

""That's not the point! You shouldn't be texting me stuff like... like that!""

""Jesus, it was just a leg, Marty, not a picture of my pussy."" Kristen said. ""Look: I'm dating a guy around your age - he's actually a little younger than you - and it seemed natural to ask you if he'd like it. I figured it'd be safe to ask a married guy; one who wouldn't mistake it for a come-on or something.""

Martin's face flushed when she said 'pussy.' He'd never heard a woman use language like that before in his young life, and certainly didn't expect it from one old enough to be his mother.

""Sorry, Kristen. I didn't realize.""

""No prob, bob. What did you think of them, anyway?""

""They were,"" he paused, remembering. ""Great. He'll really like them. You really date guys my age?""

""No,"" she demurred. ""I usually date guys a little younger than you. You'd be amazed, really. The older I get, the more I attract younger dudes. It's the same for all my friends. They all say that the younger guys all want a 'milf' or a 'cougar,' whatever that means.""

Martin opened his mouth to explain, but nothing came out. His brain was too busy trying to parse what Kristen had said. He'd heard the terms before, of course; he even knew of the websites offering quantities of older-woman porn, but he'd always figured that it was just a passing fad, a flash-in-the-pan fetish of the moment.

""Um."" He said, grasping for words. ""Well. Anyway. Do you have those files I was asking about?""

""Yup!"" Kristen enthused. ""They're here at my desk if you wanna mosey on down and pick 'em up.""

""Uh, sure?"" Martin was taken aback momentarily; he was gathering up the words to tell her to shuttle them on down to his office like any other damn secretary in the building, but then the other end of the line clicked. He looked at the dead handset in his fist. ""Oookay.""

He debated silently with himself on the question of whether or not it was worth the time, effort or possible ramifications to call her back to tell Kristen to just deliver the files. Shaking his head, Martin pushed away from his desk and stood. Less fighting would be more better.

Strolling down the hall, he noticed that just about everybody had already cleared out for lunch; most of the office doors were closed. Had they all gone out together and not told him? Again? Even Kristen wasn't at her desk.

""Great."" Taking care not to touch anything, Martin craned over her workspace, trying not to read any filenames or documents but scanning for the Pauling files he needed.

""Marty, is that you?"" Kristen's voice came from behind Petersen's closed door.

""Yes?"" He said, wondering what was going on in there. He could hear the rustling of clothes and tried not to think about what that probably meant.

""I'm just changing real quick before I head to lunch, but I tucked your files in my desk drawer for safe keeping. I didn't want to get 'em mixed up with anybody else's. You can grab 'em if you want. Bottom drawer, left-hand side."" Easing around the side of the desk and feeling like he was invading her privacy, Martin saw that Kristen clearly made use of the space underneath it as an extra shoe closet. Half a dozen pairs of heels lay in a jumble down there, including the peach platforms she'd texted him the night before. Whatever she'd been doing last night, the odds were good the secretary had come straight from there to work.

Reaching down, he slid open the bottom-left drawer. Inside, it was mostly empty, except for a pair of turquoise Nikes tossed on top of a scrap of black fabric. He heard Petersen's door open.

""Oh, shit. Sorry, Marty!"" Kristen was standing in their boss' doorway, wearing a skintight pair of bright-pink running tights that read ""JUST DO IT"" up her left thigh. She looked like she'd been poured into the tights, which flowed into every curve and hollow from ankle to hip, and the muscles in her calves and thigh bulged as she posed with one bare foot hooked behind her knee. Her turquoise tank skimmed over her plush chest, showing not the barest hint of cleavage but doing nothing to hide the luscious swells of her breasts; she raised her arms to lean against the doorway, and a hint of smooth skin poured out of the side. ""Bottom-right, I meant.""

Pointedly looking away from the mature blonde vision, Martin hauled the other drawer open to find papers stacked up to the brim. At the top was a baby-pink folder with the label ""Pauling.""

""Sorry, hon."" She said with a laugh. ""I always get those two mixed up.""

""No problem."" Martin tried not to sound irritated, tossing the file on her desk.

""Could you do me a solid and grab my sneakers while you're over there? I'm going to the gym for lunch."" Kristen unhooked her foot from behind her knee, and wiggled her pink-painted toenails at him. He suppressed an eyeroll, and reached into the left drawer.

Pulling out the sneakers, he could see that underneath them was a little pile of black fabric. Curious, Martin poked it with the toe of one sneaker, and it unrolled to reveal a tiny disheveled eyepatch of a thong, the first he'd ever seen in person. Melody didn't own any, only a cheeky pair of tiger-print briefs she'd bought as a joke for their wedding night. The fabric was a smooth, shimmery black except for the crotch, which had been stained white with-

He slammed the drawer as fast as he could, and stood up.

""Marty? Hon? Are you okay? You look like you just saw a ghost."" Kristen was looking at him with a mischievous glint in her eyes, but if she knew what he'd seen, nothing of it was revealed elsewhere in her face, which was a mask of concern.

""Yeah, I'm alright."" He gave her a weak smile. ""Here's your shoes,"" he waved them at the secretary.

""Can you bring 'em over? I don't want to get my feet dirty on this awful old carpet.""

""Sure."" Glad to get away from her desk, Martin walked out from behind it and proffered the shoes to her in an outstretched arm.

""You're not going to put them on for me?"" Kristen asked, glossy pink mouth screwed up in an exaggerated pout. She unhooked her foot and wiggled it in front of him; looking down, he could see that her toenails had been detailed with tiny hearts against the shocking pink.

""Uh-"" he started to say, but the word 'no' caught in his throat.

""Marty!"" The blonde laughed with a throaty chuckle. ""I'm joking! God, you always take me so seriously. I'm a grown woman. I can put my own shoes on."" Kristen took the sneakers from his hand and gave him a wink. ""I already know you're a Prince Charming; I hope that little wifey of yours appreciates it."" She bent to put them on, smooth bare arms pressing into her outsize chest.

""Anyway, I'm off."" Kristen whipped her hair back into a ponytail, all lazy blonde loops shot through with silver, and produced a white ballcap from somewhere. ""I look okay for the employee gym, right?"" She did a slow spin for him, revealing twin half-moons of bare, sculpted back where the racerback of her tanktop cut in; the tights poured into the thick musculature of her behind, thick rounded globes that swallowed up the pink spandex between them. ""Normally I wouldn't wear so much, but I don't want to give the execs a heart attack.""

""No, you uh- you look fine."" Martin dry-swallowed, suddenly lost for words.

""You can't see through them, can you?"" She grabbed a handful of ripe, mature ass, long fingernails digging into firm flesh, then released it. Her ass jiggled a moment, then settled back to perfection. ""This old girl's gotten a bit thicker since the last time I wore these.""

He closed his eyes and shook his head. ""Nope, nope. Not at all.""

""Thanks, Marty! You're a peach."" Kristen gave him a slightly-sticky peck on the cheek and walked away. Martin, to his credit, didn't watch her striding down the corridor, legs flashing and ass sashaying back and forth.

Well, not for very long, anyway.

*

Martin spent the rest of the afternoon poring over the Pauling file with his office door shut and his phone muted. He didn't even poke his head out until well after Kristen rapped sharply on his door, bid him a good weekend, and clacked her way out of the office. Only then, when he was sure he was relatively safe, did he slink away with his papers, secure at least in the knowledge that he had an exciting weekend of working from home ahead. He even managed to put the memory of Kristen's semen-stained panties out of his head for a while - all the long way home, all through dinner with Melody, all through dishes afterward and Netflix on the couch.

As they sat through yet another episode of *Lost*, Martin's phone buzzed on the kitchen counter. He and Melody looked at each other.

""Who's that?"" She asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Work, probably."" He said with a sigh.

""Mar*tin*,"" Melody said petulantly. ""You told me you'd *never* give work your personal number!""",,2025-08-15T18:51:43.561464,3550,

Anonymous said:

Such a wonderful story, I was so wet wishing I was Kim and Dierdre, so wet I had to masturbate, so wet I want to be watched and watch my husband emptying his load in a younger woman's pussy. I am 45 he is older, so to see him fucking a very sexy younger model would be amazing for me. How about a story where the wife enjoys both, like I want. Call them Lisa and John then I would know it was written with me in mind.

Come Fuck My Husband

I was single, just the way I liked it when I met John at a bar. His wife was at home, but he made sure to show me plenty of picture of her. It was refreshing to see that he was in love with his wife, but I took it as a bit of a challenge. I enjoyed bedding older men, especially if they were married. The thought of usurping the power of some old, insecure wives really got me off back in those days.

I was barely nineteen when I started fucking couples. I was tired of men falling in love with me constantly, and I figured that a better way to get the sex I needed as a single woman was to join couples. I got off on fucking a woman's husband right in front of her, especially if I could tell that it was bothering her a bit to share him. So many of the women I had dealt with liked to pretend that they were actually into their husband fucking a younger woman, but I could tell that actually watching their husband fuck me irked most of them.

I was a model back then and I had been since I turned sixteen. I was six-feet tall with no shoes on and my body was effortlessly thin. My tits weren't too big nor were they too small. They looked perfect on my thin frame. I had a bit of a butt and men seemed to like this about me. My hair was golden blonde and my eyes were a marbled brown color that caught the light in photos.

""I'm a model,"" I told John when he asked what I did for a living.

""That's amazing! What kind of modeling do you do?""

""Mostly editorial,"" I explained, but I could tell he had no idea what that meant. ""So, are we going back to your place after this?"" I sipped on the drink he had gotten for me.

""You want to go back to my place? You know I'm married, right?"" John asked. He looked like he was in his fifties and his dark hair was peppered with grey. He was attractive in that rugged old guy kind of way.

""You've only mentioned it twenty times since we started talking.""

""Her name is Lisa,"" he went on, ""and she has been asking me to bring home a woman to fuck while she watches. Have you ever done anything like that?""

""I actually have. I don't have a problem with that if Lisa doesn't.""

""I'm texting her right now!"" John said with excitement and I tried to be patient as he had a text conversation with his wife about me.

""She's into it. I'm ready when you are,"" John pushed his finished drink toward the bartender and looked to me.

""I'm ready too,"" I agreed as I drained the rest of my drink and set my glass down. John took my hand and led me to his car.

""Do you want to follow me there? Did you drive here?""

""I took an Uber,"" I assured him. ""I'll just ride with you.""

He unlocked his car, which turned out to be a spacious Lincoln. I sat in the passenger seat as he started the car up and began to pull out of his parking space. I let my hand wander over the center console and onto John's lap.

""You're naughty!"" he exclaimed but he didn't stop me from fondling his cock through his slacks. When he got to a light he unzipped his fly and got his cock out. ""Don't tell my wife we had this pre-game, okay? This is just between us.""

""Of course,"" I agreed and grabbed his hardening cock, stroking it the best I could. I couldn't stop myself from unbuckling my seatbelt so I could lean over and take his cock in my mouth. It felt good to be slutty and there was something fun about doing this without his wife knowing. This would be a special moment for us.

By the time we got to his house, John's cock was engorged and ready to fuck. He tried his best to slip it back into his pants before getting out and opening the door for me. He escorted me to the front door, which he opened carefully.

""Lisa? You home?"" John called out for his wife.

""I'm right here,"" Lisa came out wearing nothing but an apron. ""I was making some snacks. Oh, this must be your new friend!"" Lisa turned to me and I couldn't help but think she was pretty. She had dark hair and perfectly applied makeup. She was probably in her forties and she had the cutest smile lines on either side of her sexy mouth. I was aroused by her relaxed attitude. Clearly she wasn't jealous of me, which was a bit of a shame. I kind of liked it when the wives were jealous. However, maybe this experience would still be a fun one. After all, she was wearing nothing but an apron and her obviously fake breasts were doing a great job of making the outfit look obscene.

""I'm Caitlyn,"" I said politely, holding out my hand. ""I'm here to fuck your husband while you watch. I hope you can handle it."" I stared her down and watched as her frown turned to a look of concern.

""Well, aren't you brazen?"" Lisa said with a haughty laugh. She found my confidence amusing and not threatening as I was used to.

""I can be. Watch me suck your husband's dick and you'll see."" I gave her a naughty look before I faced John and shot my hand toward his fly to unzip it. I pulled his cock from his pants as he looked sheepishly at Lisa. ""She's a wild one!""

""She sure is,"" Lisa agreed, ""but let's see if she can actually suck some dick. I expect that you can take it down your throat, right Caitlyn."" Lisa gave an evil laugh as I popped her husband's dick into my mouth. I sucked it as if my life depended on it, trying my best to show off so Lisa would feel threatened and intimidated by my sexual skills. I took his cock down my throat and showed her exactly what I had learned as a model. The casting couch was a serious thing and I had sucked many dicks to reach the top. John's cock was nothing to me, just another dick in a long line of dicks. I stared Lisa down as she watched me.

""You're really good at sucking dick, you slut!"" Lisa pushed the back of my head so that John's cock lodged in my throat. I choked and sputtered, spitting his cock out. I gasped for air.

""Hey! Why did you do that?"" I turned and glared at Lisa, but she giggled as if the whole thing was funny.

""I enjoyed that. Sorry,"" she apologized, but I could tell that she wasn't actually sorry.

""Now it's time for me to fuck him. Bareback."" I glared at Lisa, expecting her to say no or to get upset, but instead she led John to an oversized chair in the living room and told him to sit down. ""Let's see you bounce on it.""

""Okay,"" I accepted the challenge. I climbed onto John's laps, grabbing his cock to aim it toward my pussy. I slid down onto his shaft with a satisfied sigh. ""That feels so good in me. Lisa, your husband's cock is so good!""

""Oh, I know it is, but you need to fuck him harder than that!"" Lisa grabbed me by the shoulders and began to push me down onto John's cock. She was basically using me to fuck her husband. I didn't like that she was in control of the situation. I felt like I needed to do something to regain control, but I didn't know what to do. John's cock was feeling really good and I let myself cum for the first time of the night. ""That was sexy. Now turn around and face me. I want to see your eyes while you take his dick.""

""Okay, fine,"" I agreed. I was actually having a bit more fun now that I had cum. I turned around so I was in reverse cowgirl and slid down on John's cock.

""How does her pussy feel, babe?"" Lisa asked John.

""It feels so good.""

""Better than my pussy?"" Lisa demanded to know.

""Yes, so much better. She's so much prettier than you and her pussy is so tight and warm. Not like your old pussy.""

""Do you want to feel her asshole too?"" Lisa asked him.

""Yesssss,"" John hissed.

""You heard him, slut! Put it in your ass.""

""I need some lube or something..."" I looked around for some.

""No, you don't!"" Lisa reached out and grabbed John's cock. She put it in her own mouth and sucked it until it was coated in her slobber. ""There you go. Put it in her ass,"" she encouraged John.

""Oh my God!"" I moaned as his dick entered my ass. It had been too long since I had done anal, but my muscle memory kicked in and I bounced on John's cock with my ass. Lisa knelt in front of me with her tongue out, licking my pussy as I bounced. Her tongue felt amazing, but when she added a finger into my pussy I absolutely lost it. I screamed as my second orgasm of the night made its appearance. It seemed to last forever as my body shook and shuddered.

Lisa looked pleased with herself. ""How does her asshole feel on your dick?"" she asked her husband.

""It feels so fucking good. It's so much tighter than your ass ever was,"" he assured Kim. ""You know she's a model, too. She's the hottest girl I've ever fucked.""

""I'm glad it feels good on your cock. That's what I want,"" Lisa cooed. ""She's here to make you feel good the way that I can't. Aren't you, slut?""

""Yeah!"" I agreed as Lisa rubbed my clit with her soft fingers before bending down and licking me. Her mouth on my pussy and John's cock up my ass made me cum a third time. This time Lisa kissed me to soothe me as my orgasm came to an end.

""I want you to lick my pussy now while he finishes in your ass. Can you do that?"" Lisa asked me as if she didn't think that I could.

""Yes!"" I agreed.

I was shocked as Lisa climbed up onto the chair so that one foot was on each arm. She wasn't as tall as me and it turned out that her pussy was right in my face waiting to be licked. I stuck my tongue out, swiping it across her clit the best that I could. She grabbed my head, holding onto my body to balance herself as she ground her pussy against my tongue.

I had never been ordered around by a man's wife before. In fact, I was usually the one calling the shots, but in this case I didn't mind one bit. John's cock in my ass felt so good, so I reached my hand down to my pussy to rub myself as I licked Lisa's pussy. The taste of her cunt combined with John's upward thrusts into my ass pushed me past my breaking point. I lost control of myself, screaming into Lisa's pussy as my body shuddered. I was cumming harder than I had ever cum and I couldn't seem to stop. The orgams kept going even as Lisa held my head to her pussy, making me continue to lick her even though it was a struggle.

""I think you made her cum really good,"" Lisa laughed.

""I'm about to cum really hard too, right in this tight model's ass.""

""Do it! Cum in her!"" Lisa screamed. ""And you,"" keep licking my pussy!"" She pulled my head toward her pussy so hard that she almost lost her balance. I grabbed her, pulling her toward me to keep her from falling. I wanted to taste her while John came in my ass. I wanted it so much.

""Fuck!"" John moaned and I knew that he was cumming deep in my asshole. I felt so used as he finished and came to a stop.

Lisa jumped down from her perch on the chair and helped me up and off of John's cock.

""Can I taste your dick now?"" Lisa asked John.

""That was just in my ass!"" I tried to warn her.

""I know. That's what I like - the taste of ass!"" Lisa winked at me.

I found this a bit disgusting, but as Lisa crouched on the floor in between John's legs and took his dirty cock in her mouth, she moaned as if she was in ecstasy.

""You like watching this?"" John asked me.

""She's a bit twisted,"" I admitted.

""Your ass tastes good,"" Lisa took a moment to tell me before she wrapped her mouth back around John's cock.

""She sure is. I should have warned you,"" John said, but I knew he didn't mean it.

""I think maybe it's time for me to go,"" I said quickly, reaching for my purse so I could find my phone. I would call for a ride and this would be another one of my many adventures.

""No! Don't go! Not yet. I want to taste your ass and pussy again!"" Lisa begged me. ""Please stay. Stay for as long as you can. I want you to fuck my husband some more.

""Well, I suppose I can stay a bit longer,"" I agreed.

""Come sit on John's face,"" Lisa suggested. ""He need to taste that pussy too.""

""You're not like any of the other wives I've met,"" I laughed as I admitted this to Lisa.

""What are they like?""

""Jealous and insecure.""

""Oh, I see. Well, I'm not jealous or insecure. I'm horny and I love the taste of pussy and ass. Ever had your ass eaten?""

""No, I haven't,"" I admitted.

""Tell you what. You stick around and we can do all the fun things you've never gotten to do with the other wives, okay?""

""Okay!"" I agreed and I hopped onto John's face and decided that maybe it wasn't so bad taking orders from Lisa and letting her be in control. She was the first wife I'd come across that actually loved watching me fuck her husband. Of course, she also loved fucking me too. It was awesome!",,2025-08-15T18:51:50.566903,2533,

Whitney stood at the kitchen sink and felt the warm sunlight on her face. Dressed only in a flimsy thin silk robe, her stiff nipples were on full display. Swollen and tender from the near constant attention her father-in-law had been paying them since he arrived.

Smiling, Whitney thought of the last 48 hours with Gary and realized she'd never been happier. She knew that her friends would judge her for how quickly and willingly she submitted to Gary. But Whitney no longer cared what they thought.

Only a month ago, she'd been sitting at Tanya's house for book club listening to some of the women talk about their careers and the struggle of juggling a corporate job while also being a mother. Whitney knew that her true role was as a homemaker and a mom. She had no interest in pretending she wanted to work outside the home.

The pieces of the puzzle that had felt misaligned in her life started snapping into place when Gary arrived. When he complimented the way Whitney ran her home, it meant more to her than any gold star or annual performance review at a job would.

Even being told when to spread her legs and how he wanted to have sex - how often, how rough and how long - made her more wet than she'd ever been. Whitney had never claimed to be a feminist but she was ready to tell anyone, she'd rather be dicked down by a rough Daddy than be policed by some new wave bullshit.

Speaking of her Daddy, Whitney was positively head over heels for him. Gary was hairier than any man she'd ever been with. When he was naked, he was like a wild unkempt beast and that turned her on. And she loved that he wasn't ashamed of his masculine energy. He was proud of it and she liked that. The contrast of her smooth soft skin rubbing against his hairy body only heightened the primal nature of the sex they had.

She liked that he brought out her inner slut too.

Like yesterday when he and Whitney were supposed to go visit her husband in the hospital. Gary was dressed and waiting for her in the living room. Whitney had excused herself to go to the bathroom and returned a moment later and took a seat across from him in an armchair. She smiled as she held up a small purple piece of fabric.

""What have you got there,"" Gary asked with a smirk as she tossed her panties to him. He caught them in his hand and felt how warm and wet they were and immediately got an erection in his jeans.

Whitney smiled wickedly and thought If this chapter of her life was part of a story in an online forum, an anonymous critic might call this situation ""vile amoral putridness"" and ""beyond the pale."" But Gary and Whitney weren't living for anonymous commenters, they were responding to their primal desires.

Sliding back in her chair, Whitney spread her legs wide while she slowly and methodically lifted the hem of her skirt until the thick bush of her hairy pussy was exposed to him. Gary unzipped his jeans and took out his cock.

""We should probably get going, right,"" Whitney asked with a coquettish tone.

""No one likes a tease. Play with that pussy for Daddy,"" he told her as he began to stroke.

Lifting her fingers to her mouth, she licked the tips of them before she began to masturbate for her father-in-law. She was using slow and steady circular motions on her pussy, spreading her hairy lips to expose the wet pink inside to him.

At one point without being asked, Whitney pulled the top of her flimsy dress down exposing her huge full breasts and hardened pink nipples dripping with milk. Her breasts heaved up and down as she lifted her left leg and draped it over the arm of the chair while she bit her lower lip.

Gary could see she was perspiring as her pale naked flesh shimmered in the light. Gripping her panties in his hand, he stood up and she followed him wordlessly as they made their way up to the bedroom.

That afternoon they fucked for at least an hour. Vigorous and passionate fucking. Doggystyle to begin. Whitney's giant breasts swaying as her round ass bounced off Gary's hips. The vision of his hairy cock thrusting into her sloppy pussy drove him wild. The phone began to ring but they ignored it, too wrapped up in the moment.

Pulling his rigid cock from her warm wet pussy, they switched to missionary. The phone rang again as Whitney wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck. It was during this moment that Whitney stared deep into her father-in-law's eyes and told him that she wanted to have his baby.

""That's the plan, darling,"" he said kissing her while her hands ran down his back and grabbed his hairy ass, pulling him deeper into her. Never one to pass up an opportunity to suckle, Gary moved his face to one of her pink nipples and used his bearded mouth to drink in the warm sweet milk.

She was moaning like a banshee and begging for him to, ""cum in my pussy, Daddy! Breed me, Daddy!"" The phone rang again and Whitney shouted, ""Don't stop, Daddy! Don't stop!""

Gary reached and grabbed the phone cord next to the bed and roughly yanked the plug from the wall. Whatever it was, it wasn't nearly as important as this. Turns out it was ex wife calling so he'd made the right decision to rip the plug.

Shortly after Jason passed away and it was quickly decided that Gary and Whitney would marry and the family would move to Gary's. Whitney couldn't wait to be pregnant.

The week before they left though, Whitney was caught off guard as she was lying in bed with Gary after a morning lovemaking session. Her fingers danced through his chest hair and her heavy milk swollen breast pressed against his side. It was while she was kissing his chest that he spoke.

""I'm gonna fuck your mom before we leave,"" Gary announced casually, as if he as saying they were out of milk. Whitney felt her heart beating fast as her mind raced with jealousy and fear. This was a new challenge she would need to rise to as his lover. She knew better than to voice any of the thoughts racing through her head so she lifted her head and looked right at her Daddy before speaking.

""I think that's a great idea,"" she purred before kissing him on the mouth. Gary smiled and put both of his hands behind his head and closed his eyes.

Whitney moved down his naked body. Kissing and licking his hairy flesh the whole way to take his soft cock, still warm and sticky from her cunt, in her wet mouth for a proper cleaning. As she lovingly licked his hairy balls and took him in her mouth, her mind wondered what she'd feel like being cucked by her own mother.

That afternoon Whitney began researching the term ""cuckquean.""",,2025-08-15T18:51:57.674569,1282,

""I can't believe we're finally landowners!"" Michael Woods stood on the front lawn, looking up at the house, the vinyl siding gleaming white in the sun. A mature oak shaded the big bay window of the living room, but none of the four bedrooms. He immediately began manhandling the realtor's sign out of the turf.

""I can't believe you talked me into that,"" Kendra motioned at the French window over the garage adjoining the house.

""What?"" He said in disbelief. ""Are you joking? It's a perfect little guest room with its own bath and everything. Yeah, it shares a wall with the Master, but Nance said it's totally soundproofed, so privacy's not an issue."" Mike waggled his eyebrows meaningfully at his young wife.

""I really wish you wouldn't call her that,"" she clucked her tongue.

""She asked me to,"" he said. ""She's your family friend, anyway. She even gave us a break on the fees.""

""It's just...familiar,"" Kendra huffed, agitated now. ""Besides, she's not a family friend, she used to be a friend of my mother's, and the less said about her the better.""

""Anyway, what's the problem with the room?""

""I dunno,"" her brow furrowed. ""The name, I guess. How can it be a Mother-in-law suite? My mother in law passed away when you were five, and I haven't seen your mother-in-law since before we met. It's weird. Just thinking about it give me the heebiejeebies.""

Mike tossed the sign aside, and walked over to hug his wife. ""Ken, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anything. It's not going to summon your mother - though I would like to meet her one day - and we can call it the guest suite or the hobby room or the Velvet Lounge, if you like. Cheer up!"" He motioned expansively. ""All this is ours! All this space, all this green, all these rooms we can fill up with babies or puppies or balloons or any damn thing we please. No more walkups, no more street noise, no more-""

""...creepy landlords,"" Kendra supplied.

""No more creepy landlords, or throwing rent money into a shitty two-bedroom apartment we'd never own."" He held her face in his hands. ""We're finally starting our grownup life.""

Kendra's arms slid around him. ""I guess things are looking up, after all."" She smiled, and pulled him closer. ""Well, one thing is definitely up, anyway.""

He grinned. ""Wanna see how many rooms we can 'christen' today?""

They ran into the house hand-in-hand, giddy and elated.

* * *

Nancy Perillo had, in fact, known Kendra Woods (nee Valentine) her entire life, watching her blossom from a mousy, nervous little girl into a mousy, nervous, unremarkable young woman. She had also, as Mike said, waived a portion of her commission for the purchase of their home; she hadn't told them that she'd also been representing the seller of the house, and took home a hefty commission from the sale of it as well.

She'd even told Mike to call her 'Nance,' a courtesy she'd never extended to Kendra, or ever would. But then, he was a strapping man half her age and much better looking than his shrinking violet of a wife. For Nancy, the attraction had been immediate from the moment the young couple had walked into her office, all wide-eyed and naive. She had given Mike's lean, muscular frame more than a casual glance, taking in his vigor and assessing what he'd be like in bed. Excellent, was the first impression; and he wouldn't have been the first young husband to fall victim to the realtor's well-aged charms. In fact, it usually wasn't long after their first meeting that husbands were making excuses to view properties alone with 'Nance,' particularly after they took a measure of the length of her legs, the brevity of her skirts, and the ample assets hidden underneath her smartly-tailored blazer. Mike, to his credit, didn't even seem to notice her silky blond tresses (shot through with an artful streak of gray), or the glossy plumpness of her mouth. He had eyes only for his wife.

It had taken her almost a minute to notice Kendra was even there, and another minute to realize she was Vivien's daughter.

That had, for once, taken Nancy aback. It was one thing to fuck strapping young men while their wives were picking out window treatments. It was another thing entirely to do it to her best friend's daughter. Not that she ever stopped thinking about it, of course, but even Nancy had her limits. The fact that Vivien was a cutthroat, predatory bitch was probably also a determining factor. A very rich, cutthroat, predatory bitch who happened to to be buying up property on the East Side...

Nancy hit the intercom on her desk.

""Tom-mmmmmy,"" she cooed. ""Can you step in here a minute, please?""

The real estate firm's handsome young intern came galloping in through her door. All his forward momentum came to a halt as he caught sight of Nancy's hand, gently fingering her blouse, unbuttoned far enough to expose a generous helping of well-aged, mature cleavage.

""Yes Mrs. Pirello?"" He asked after a long second.

""Can you be a dear and get Vivien Valentine from Valentine Holdings on the phone for me?""

""Um..."" he said, watching her fingers slide along the silk. Every now and again he'd catch a glimpse of the lacy pink bra underneath. ""Yes?""

""Good!"" Nancy leaned back, and kicked her feet up on the desk, revealing miles of leg. She dangled one tall, tan pump from her foot. He stared for a moment, then blinked and reluctantly turned to go.

""Oh, Tommy?"" She called, reeling him back. ""Are you still seeing that little girl down in accounting?""

""Um,"" he watched her shoe twitch back and forth. ""Janey, yeah. We've been steady for a while now.""

""Riiight,"" Nancy said. ""Plain Jane. You know, I don't think she's right for you.""

""What?"" He said, suddenly snapped out of his trance.

""No, honey. A boy like you needs someone who can take him in hand,"" Nancy sat up, and leaned over. The yawning cavern of her cleavage drew his eyes like a magnet. ""Someone with a little experience in life, someone who knows what a boy needs, someone who can lead and mold him."" She let the unspoken conclusion hang in the air. All Tom could do was stare at her enormous, mature chest.

""Anyway,"" she sat back. ""Why don't you go and run my little errand, and think about it?""

""Um, sure. I mean, yes Mrs. Pirello."" He took a last longing glance, and left, closing the door behind him. Nancy watched him go, and felt a delicious warmth growing between her thighs.

* * *

""Hey,"" Mike nudged Kendra as they lounged in the bed, admiring the crown moldings. ""Wanna go again?""

""Jeez."" She whapped him with a pillow. ""Again?""

""Yeah, I figure we haven't properly christened these new sheets yet til we've fuc-""

""Mike,"" she cut him short. ""You know I don't like that word.""

He laughed. ""Okay, fine. Until we've made love in them a few more...""

""Honey, I'm tired and I'm kind of sore after that last time."" She sighed and rolled into him. ""We've done 'it' almost every day this week. Maybe we can give it a rest for a few days?""

""Oh yeah? Well, how about I-""

* DINGDONGADINGDONG*

""Is that really what the doorbell sounds like?"" Kendra asked. Mike laughed.

""We'll have to change that, I guess. Shall I go or do you wanna?"" He gestured towards the door.

* DINGDONGADINGDONG*

""I would, but my robe is over there."" She looked at him and pouted. ""Pleeeeeease?""

""Alright, alright,"" he said, whapping her lightly with a pillow.

* DINGDONGADINGDONG*

""Jesus, those Girl Scouts are impatient,"" Mike said. He swung himself out of the bed and jumped into a pair of pajama pants. ""I'm coming! I'm coming!"" he shouted, galloping down the stairs as the doorbell went off again.

""Hold your goddamn horses, I'm cum-"" he opened the door, and the rest of the words fell out of his brain.

The woman standing on the doorstep snapped her compact shut, and slid it into the pink clutch dangling from an elbow. For the first time, Mike found himself looking up into a woman's eyes, as she towered a couple of inches above his own height. They were green, under a sweep of deep auburn hair that coiled and looped and tumbled lazily down her shoulders. A brief leather jacket was hung around her shoulders, underneath which she wore a simple black t-shirt; the Ray-Bans dangling from the v-neck naturally drew Mike's eye downwards, but that was gilding the lily. The clingy jersey was stretched taut by her sizable chest, and he could just make out the scalloped lace of the bra she wore underneath through the fabric. A smile played at the corner of her plush mouth, painted a shimmering pink.

""Um-"" said Mike.

""You must be my new son in law,"" the woman said. Her eyes raked him up and down, and Mike was suddenly very aware that he wasn't wearing a shirt. ""Nancy did say you were a cutie."" She swept in past him in a cloud of perfume. ""Be a good boy and bring my bags in, won't you? They're in the car"" Her hair brushed his face as she strode by, and he turned his head involuntarily to watch her strut, her impossibly long, lethal-looking legs flashing past in skintight olive jeans that did nothing to hide the sinuous curves of her ass. The tall heels of her black leather ankle boots tik-tok'ed ominously on the hardwood. An enormous red Hummer sat in his driveway, the back door open to reveal a host of bloated suitcases.

""Wait, what?"" Mike shook his head, and wheeled around in the doorway, closing the door behind him. She stood at the foot of the stairs, one hand cocked on her hip, clutch dangling; brightly-colored nails sank just a little into the perfectly-rounded flesh of her left buttock. She tapped her foot impatiently.

""Where is that girl?"" The woman asked, glancing around. ""Ken? Kendra, sweetheart, it's your mother!""

Mike's breath caught in his throat. ""Mrs...Valentine?"" She glanced back at him over her shoulder.

""Oh, you don't have to be so formal, honey."" Kendra's mother said with a smile. ""You may call me Vivien, for the time being. Now weren't you supposed to be doing something for me?""

""Vivien, I don't think that Kendra's-""

""MOTHER!"" Kendra appeared at the top of the stairs, wearing a long white terrycloth robe. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?"" She came galloping down, feet hardly touching a stair on the way. ""HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND US? MIKE! DID YOU LET HER IN!?""

""Um-"" was all Mike got out before Kendra started yelling again.

""GOD DAMMIT MIKE!"" He took a step towards her, concern written across his features. ""DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH ME.""

""Um-""

""Michael, honey."" He felt Vivian's hand on his arm. Her voice was smooth as silk, but Mike could hear the steel in it. ""Why don't you step outside while us girls have a little family heart-to-heart?"" She gave him a gentle push towards the door.

Suddenly, Mike was standing outside watching as his own front door was slammed shut in his face. There was a *click* as the deadbolt slid into place. Raised voices could be heard behind it.

""What the hell just happened?"" He asked nobody in particular. The opened door of the Hummer beckoned him from the driveway. He cast one last look towards the front door, sighed in a resigned fashion, and went to work pulling the first bag out.

There were three large Burberry suitcases and a single smaller carry-on bag, packed solid with clothes. It took Mike fifteen minutes of sweating and struggling to get them around to the unlocked back door after his knocks at the front produced nothing. He pushed the door open and poked his head inside. At least the shouting had stopped.

""Helloooo? Ken? Kendra?"" With a grunt, he heaved the first bag through the back door. ""Mrs. Val- I mean, Vivien?""

""In here, Michael dear."" His mother-in-law called from within. Pulling the luggage by its handle through the house, he poked his head into the living room. There, on the couch, mother and daughter were hugging it out. Vivien had her arms wrapped around Mike's wife, and was gently stroking her hair.

""Everything okay?"" He asked. Kendra nodded silently. Her eyes looked red and her hair was a disheveled mess, particularly in comparison to Vivien's own silken auburn mane.

""Why don't you carry my bags up to the guest room Michael?"" Vivien turned her head to regard him. ""We're having a little heart-to-heart here."" She turned back to hug her daughter, and the hem of her t-shirt rose up out of the back of her jeans, revealing a long slice of creamy flesh at her lower back; Mike glimpsed some intricate scroll-work around the dimples that framed her tail-bone, and immediately looked away, embarrassed.

""Yeah, I uh, I'll be back,"" he stumbled out of the living room. His mother-in-law had a tramp stamp! Kendra didn't have any ink, but there was her own mother, tatted up like some co-ed. Mike hefted the handle of the bag he'd dragged in, and began lugging it up over the stairs. Idly, he wondered what Vivien's tattoo looked like. Something tasteful and girly, probably - a butterfly or a tree in bloom - then he realized that he'd been trying to visualize his mother-in-law's ink, and tried to shake the vision away. The spell was broken when the bag finally hit the top stair, and there was just the tiniest ripping sound as if extremely expensive fibers had given way just a fraction.

Mike froze, cursed, then gave the bag a quick once-over. There didn't seem to be anything amiss. Gingerly, silently praying to whomever would listen, he extended the handle and began pulling the bag down the hallway. Halfway down, there was another tiny sound - this time, metallic. He stopped, and fell to one knee beside the bag. It was probably worth more than he made in a month, and there was no way he'd be able to replace it right now.

Closer inspection showed that the zipper had given way on one side, less than an inch or so. He could see a riot of brightly colored fabric just inside. Standing up again, he gingerly pulled it down the hall, even more slowly than before. When he got to the lintel of the guest suite at the end, Mike decided not to tempt fate, and lifted the bag up by the bottom; he gently laid it down on the floor, and gave a quiet crow of triumph.

His elation was cut short by the tik-tik-tik-tiktiktik-tiktiktiktiktik of the zipper's teeth as they all gave way in a cascading failure. He didn't even have time to curse before the top of the bag was pushed open by the pressure of the bag's contents, and they all came tumbling out in a heap on the floor. Before Mike even knew what he was doing, he was back down on hands and knees, frantically scooping up Vivien's belongings and trying to stuff them back into the case. It all seemed to be scraps of lace and nylon and silk and-

He held one up in both hands. It was a thong, in shimmering gold nylon, scarcely enough fabric for an eye patch, with the most delicate lace scalloping in the back. A tiny metal tag along the waistband read ""La Perla."" Absently, he rubbed the fabric between his fingers - it was richer, sumptuous almost, than Kendra's plan white Hanes. The tag of a lacy pink pair waved up at him, reading ""Agent Provocateur."" A pair of lavender boyshorts with a tie-dye lace waistband screamed ""LOVE PINK.""

He ran his hands through the pile in wonderment: he'd never seen such an assortment in his life. Kendra owned one pair of cheap leopard-print briefs for ""special nights"" (that he was pretty sure she'd chucked shortly after they got married), and her mother apparently traveled with more thongs than Kendra had underwear.

""See something you like, Michael dear?"" He looked up to see Vivien standing in the doorway, a bemused smile playing on her plush lips.

""Oh, shit no! I'm sorry I'm so sorry!"" He began scooping the panties back into the carry-on at double speed, creating more mess than he'd started with. ""The zipper broke and then everything just kind of,"" he gestured helplessly at the pile of underwear. Vivien toed the pink Provocateurs with her bootie and lifted them off the ground.

""You sure you weren't rifling through your mother-in-law's underwear, Michael?"" Vivien dangled the panties in front of him. They swayed gently on the polished leather. ""Looking for something naughty, perhaps?""

""Um...no? That would-"" His eyes were locked on the silky scrap of fabric. His fingers tingled with the memory of how they felt. ""That would be wrong.""

""Very wrong, darling."" Vivien kicked them into his lap. ""I'm practically your mother, after all. But I'm sure you would have seen them at some point."" She let the words hang in the air for a moment. ""I'm going to be here for a little while, and Kendra tells me you're the one who does the laundry. I suppose it's just as well that you get it out of your system now: I'd hate to find any of them missing.""

""Hey listen,"" he rose to one knee. ""I'm not sure what you're-""

Vivien kicked another pair at him, and Mike immediately fell back to both knees to catch them. ""It's okay, Michael, dear. I'm sure you've never seen anything like these. My daughter's tastes do not exactly align with mine."" She gave him an appraising look. ""Most of the time, anyway. Kendra's always had somewhat...simple tastes, like a little girl. I prefer the finer things in life, more...complex pleasures that she's never really understood. I came here assuming the two of you were more or less the same, but perhaps I was wrong about you.""

Mike was suddenly aware that his fingers were fondling the slick black panties she'd kicked at him. ""Hey, I'm not like that."" He dropped them. ""I really don't understand what's going on here, but I'm not sure I like it."" He began to rise from the floor again.

""There's nothing to be embarrassed about, Michael."" She waved her hand dismissively. ""It's perfectly normal for a strapping young man like yourself to yearn for something more complex, more mature. My daughter is simply a case of arrested development, but perhaps there's still hope for you.""

""I'm sorry your bag broke,"" he said firmly. ""I'll pay to replace it if you like. I'll go get the rest and then this conversation is over.""

""Of course,"" Vivien stood aside so he could leave. ""Your house is your castle. Except my little annex in here - my little queendom. Please do remember to knock when you come back up. I'd hate to be caught in a...compromising position."" He strode out, and the door shut firmly behind him.

Mike was halfway down the stairs before he realized he had a prodigious erection tenting his pajama pants.

* * *

He didn't see Vivien again til later that evening, not even after he'd struggled the rest of her luggage up the stairs. He'd just left them by her door and knocked; she didn't emerge to retrieve them until after he'd gone back downstairs. She made Mike uncomfortable to say the least, but her effect on Kendra was startling - after their little tete-a-tete in the living room, Ken had retreated to the living room to silently watch reruns of House Hunters International in her flannel pajamas. She didn't seem sad or angry, just kind of numb; Kendra wouldn't even answer his questions when he asked about what her mother had said or how long she was planning to stay. She seemed so out of it that he couldn't even work up the frustration to get mad at her.

It wasn't until he was in the kitchen, cooking dinner, that he heard the pad of bare feet on the linoleum and felt a pair of arms encircle his waist.

""Honey, I'm glad you decided to come out of your funk,"" Mike turned around to find himself staring straight into Vivien's vivid green eyes.",,2025-08-15T18:52:29.807139,3512,
https://www.literotica.com/s/cuckquean-chronicles-02-1,Cuckquean Chronicles 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"So there I was - sitting in a tent with my best friend, Erin, comforting her because my husband George had just given her so much pleasure that she had almost come for the first time in her life. To her credit, she actually calmed down pretty quickly.

""I should go tell him I'm sorry,"" Erin said, ""I should have warned him. The one or two other times I think I was getting close to really cumming, something like that happened. It's never been with someone else... and frankly I didn't really believe you when you said he was that good.""

""Well then you have no one to blame but yourself, then,"" I chirped, giving her a little poke. She started laughing, the tears still on her cheek. Erin was still extremely cute as she approached 30. She had a compact, strong body, maybe 5'4"", with brown hair reaching down to her shoulders, cute B-cup breasts that still stood perky with small brown nipples. She hiked a lot and you could see that in her body: she was slim and strong but had a thin layer of fat that accentuated her hips and breasts. And, right now, she had a kind of unkempt thick brown bush that nonetheless left her labia fully exposed. Seeing her cute pussy, lips still red and wet from what George had been doing to her sent a surge of desire through me.

""I feel bad,"" she said, wiping the tears away with a smile, ""I bet George is feeling miserable.""

""Oh, I'm sure he had his fun..."" I responded.

""I don't know, he seemed really focused on my pleasure, his cock was probably only in me for about five minutes of that whole time. The rest was his hands, and his tongue, his fingers, and he definitely didn't get off. God, the way he wraps his lips around your clit, did you teach him that? That's what almost pushed me over the edge.""

I had just cum, but sitting here, holding my best friend, seeing her naked body, still drenched with sweat from the fucking she had gotten on this warm summer night, and talking about how my husband had literally broken her brain by making her feel so good - I was getting incredibly aroused again.

We spent the rest of the evening debriefing what had happened: George had started really slowly, undressing Erin, kissing her, exploring her body. She started squiring in my arms as she described how she felt when he took her bra off, and took his nipple in her mouth, swirling his tongue around it. Once he got her fully undressed he went down on her, gently licking her clit before moving the hood and tonguing it more directly. He started fingering her, but then she got impatient and wanted his cock. She climbed on top of him - and this was what I saw through the thin tent wall - them sitting up, her legs wrapped around him.

""And I was just kind of bucking on his cock..."" she told me, ""And each time I thrust my clit would rub against him. And I felt his cock start to twitch a little bit. And I realized his cock was bare, and thought about how I hadn't had a bare cock in so long, it's been years, and he might cum in me. And I felt this feeling build up in me, and I felt out of control, and I couldn't stop bucking on him, and then the feeling morphed into just being completely overwhelmed, so I burst out crying. He stopped, held me, I eventually managed to get off his cock... and that's when you found me.""

""Do you want to try again?"" I tried to keep my voice calm, but I could feel my heart pounding. I wanted her to.

""Would you be okay with it?""

""Yes."" I replied too quickly, ""I mean, I think it's a tragedy that you're almost 30 and have never cum. And if anyone can get you there, George can.""

""But this is just going to happen again. It's happened every time, even when I'm alone. I just don't know what will be different.""

""Maybe,"" the my voice caught in excitement, ""if you have something else to distract you, keep you calm, make you feel safe...""

""What?"" she asked with a chuckle, ""have a soothing meditation podcast in my ear while your husband is wearing me like a puppet?""

""Well, I mean, do I make you feel safe?"" I asked, my voice quiet, gently stroking her hair.

""Yes,"" she said, looking up at me with those emerald green eyes. ""Are you saying, you want to be there while you're husband fucks me?""

I almost couldn't catch my breath with excitement. ""Well, I could do what I'm doing now. Keep you kind of distracted. Make you feel safe. Stroke your hair..."" ... kiss you. Touch your pussy. Lick your nipples. God it has been so long since I've been with a woman... ""... make you feel safe.""

Erin told me she would think about it, but needed some rest. We laid out a sleeping bag - it was a warm night, and that would be too warm probably, and nestled up to go to sleep. Erin still naked, me in my panties and tank top.

Erin dropped right off. I... struggled. I fidgeted, rubbing my legs against each other. I kept looking over at her, skin pale in the dim moonlight coming through the tent's mesh window. She shifted, laying on her side with her back to me, letting me admire her curves, my eyes tracing down her back to the cup of her ass. I slipped my hand in my panties, and closed my eyes, holding my breath as I slowly rubbed my clit in gentle circles. The feeling was electric. Having to be quiet made it even more so. But I couldn't quite get myself there. I was dripping wet, but my mind was flying all over the place: remembering how George felt inside of me, the image of their bodies writhing together, imagining having a threesome with the two of them where Erin got her first orgasm.

I edged over closer to Erin, me lying on my back, her on her side with her back to me. I laid my free hand next to me, in the space between us. Then I felt it creeping. Moving slowly towards her. I felt the heat from her skin, and the back of my finger slowly brushed against her ass, as I rubbed myself, desperate for release.

And then I snapped out of it. What the fuck was I doing? Touching my best friends as while she slept? I mean, I know she wouldn't mind - she's the kind of person who would go down on a friend as a favor, and we've hooked up before - but that's not the point. Not my decision to make. I was so horny I was making stupid, stupid decisions.

I couldn't sleep, so decided to get some attention where I knew I could. Still in my panties and tank top, I slipped out of the tent, and across the few feet to the single tent my husband, George slept in. I unzipped the tent, and climbed in next to him - it was a tight fit. I took a moment to admire my husband. He was a big man - about 6'3"" and maybe 250 lbs, a very strong build with just the hint of a dad-bod starting. He was laying on his back with his soft, uncut cock lying against his leg. I whispered his name, but he didn't wake up - he was always a deep sleeper - so I crawled next to him, draped myself on his side, and started slowly massaging his cock.

""Geeooorge..."" I whispered, feeling his cock slowly thickening and growing in my hands as I stroked his shaft. ""Your lucky night...""

He groaned slightly and opened his eyes as I slithered my body down his, my face pressing into his hip. I could smell her - Erin - on his cock, the sweet, intoxicating aroma of another woman's juices. I took him into my mouth, and felt him grow - he's a solid 6 inches and quite, quite thick, but is a bit of a grower, so I enjoyed the sensation of being able to get his entire cock in my mouth, warm, soft, and slowly growing firmer.

He was now fully awake, and started thrusting into my mouth. I could see in his eyes how much he was enjoying this, and god, I loved tasting Erin on him. But I needed more. I climbed on top of him, kissing him hard on the lips, as I reached between us and positioned him on the entrance to my pussy. I was so wet he slid into me incredibly easily, and I took him to the hilt, and started grinding on him.

I wonder sometimes how much of my love for George is based on how good his cock feels in me. When I take him all in me, and thrust, the slight upward curve hits my g-spot just right. He's the only partner I've ever had who made me cum from just fucking me - not every time - but he can.

I could immediately tell he would make me cum on his cock this time. I was so worked up, I couldn't keep myself upright, I leaned forward with my hands falling above his shoulders. He took my breast in his hand, squeezed it, and took the nipple in his mouth, sucking and tonguing it. My breasts had always hung off of me, swayed, even when I was younger, and I had frequently been self conscious about it. But George loved my breasts, and made me love them even more. He loved how they hung in his face, how he could wrap both hands around one of them, like he was doing now, and take my nipple into his mouth.

I was in heaven. I was rutting like an animal, bucking on him, and he reached down, tracing his hand down my belly, past my pelvis, and wedged his thumb between my clit and his pelvis, so every thrust I was grinding it into him. My legs started to shake, my arms collapsed, and he wrapped his arms around me. I lost my coordination, but he took over, thrusting into me, moving me with each of his thrusts. I couldn't help it. I cried out as I came, probably waking up people in tents all around us.

George stayed still as my tremors subsided.

""Holy shit, what got into you tonight?"" he asked, as I started rocking my hips on him again.

""I just needed you,"" I whispered in his ear, twerking my hips in a way I knew he liked. ""Hearing how good you make another woman feels... good reminder of how good you are at this.""

""Mmm,"" he said, closing his eyes, squeezing my ass and enjoying my movement.

""Did you like Erin's cute little tits? Her pussy? I remember it feeling really tight last time I fingered it,"" I purred into his ear.

""Well, I was mostly focused on getting her off...""

""It's okay, you can tell me. Tell me she was a good fuck.""

""Mmm, she was a good fuck baby...""

I sped up. I wanted his cum, while he talked about how good my friend's pussy was. He slowed me down. Then he sped me up again. Using his hips to guide me, moving me at the rhythm he wanted. But there was something not quite right with his movements - he couldn't get us into a rhythm, or decide what he wanted. As this continued I grew more confused, but just tried to focus on making him feel good, making him feel as good as he had just made me feel.

""I'm sorry babe,"" he muttered, ""I don't know if I can cum tonight. It's late, I've had a weird up-and-down day with sex, and I kinda have to pee...""

My heart fell, I really wanted his cum. But I understood. This kind of thing happened sometimes. I climbed off of him, his cock already getting a little soft. He got up, said he was going to head out to the bathroom.

""When you get back, would you mind slipping in and sleeping with Erin? She snores pretty badly, which is part of why I couldn't sleep tonight."" A total lie, but I kinda wanted some time alone with my disappointment. And, if I was honest, sending him back in with my naked best friend was intriguing to me. He said no problem, gave me a very sweet kiss, and snuck out.

--

I woke up the next morning feeling surprisingly well rested for how early it was. The camp wasn't really waking up just yet. The temp had dropped overnight, so I threw on some shorts and a sports bra under a t-shirt then slipped out of my tent. To my surprise, I heard some low murmurs coming from the tent where Erin and George had been sleeping.

I walked over, and unzipped then tent - and the image I saw is still burned into my mind. Erin was naked, climbing off of Geroge, his dick still pointing high in the air, red and swollen. She was raising the leg closest to me up in the air as she dismounted him, and I could see the flushed redness of her outer lips, then her inner lips parting as she spread her pulled her leg over him. I could see a little white droplet of cum on the entrance to her pussy, but as she shifted, putting all of her weight on her other leg, that drop became a torrent of cum that slipped out of her, running a course down her thighs, leaving a shiny trail as it went. To this day I get off on that image in my mind.

They didn't look like they had been caught at anything - there was no rush to their movements, no attempt to hide - I don't even think the initially noticed the tent flap opening until I had gotten this entire view. I think she was just climbing off of him because they were finished.

""Morning, love"" George said with a smile, his firm cock softening as the stimulation of Erin's pussy left it.

""I didn't think you'd mind..."" Erin said, not making eye contact with me at first. ""I think he deserved a reward after everything I put him through that night.""

--

I didn't mind. Did I? We both fuck other people, that's part of our relationship. So of course I didn't mind. And this was Erin, my friend, so I as glad they were having fun. Right? But then... then why did I feel a rush of warmth going to my cheeks? Why was my heart pounding like this? And why, when I have never had any desire to know the details of George's other sexual encounters, did I attack George and ask him to tell me everything, the moment Erin had left the tent for a shower? Jealousy? Shame? Arousal? I hadn't yet learned it can easily be all three.

""Well,"" he started, a little bit sheepishly, ""it got a little bit cold in the night, and we had already opened the one sleeping bag and spread it on the ground. So we kinda started cuddling up, and when we woke up freezing in the night I opened up the other sleeping bag to pull over us like a blanket. In the morning, I woke up with my cock pressed into the small of Erin's back, so I tried to shift back a little bit, but she complained 'no,' and reached back to pull me in to keep spooning her.""

""She told me she felt bad for blubbering last night, and I said not to worry about it. Then she told me she wanted to make it up to me. I asked how, and she said something like 'well, you got me so close to cumming, and I sent you off with blue balls, I should probably fix that,' and while she was saying that she reached back and started stroking my cock.""

My breathing got faster. My heart raced like I was running for my life. My head was spinning. What was happening to me?

""I started kissing the back of her neck and reached around to play with her nipples, but she pushed my hand away, and said 'none of that, this morning is all for you. We can't have me getting over stimulated again.' She rolled me on my back, I pulled my boxers down, and she climbed on to me. She was already wet somehow - I'm not sure why, and she started bouncing on my cock. I think putting on a bit of a show.""

No explanation of my role in any of this. No 'I knew you wouldn't mind' or 'we talked about it and decided it was okay to fuck again.' I mean, he didn't owe me that, but damn, they just wanted each other. I had nothing to do with it.

George was laying on his back, one arm behind his head, looking up at me sitting cross-legged next to him as he described the scene to me. His hand started stroking my thigh, and I wondered if he could feel the furnace that was my pussy at that moment. Even if he hadn't paid me any mind when deciding to fuck my best friend again, his hand felt comforting now.

""How did she feel?"" I asked

George hesitated. ""Good,"" he finally said, ""do you want to know more?"" I nodded.

""Well she fells kind of - more textured - like you're really smooth inside, and feel amazing, but she is just - different. I haven't played with anyone else bear since we got together, and I honestly I think only had raw sex with one or two other people before we met. So I didn't really appreciate... how different a pussy can feel.""

He wasn't saying he preferred her pussy, was he?

""And she has really strong kegals. I didn't notice it last night, but this morning, she was like, gripping me every time he pulled up. It felt almost like getting a hand job from someone's pussy.""

I couldn't catch my breath. Maybe he was.

""So anyways, she tells me this is all for me, and she wants to see how fast she can get me off. She is bouncing up and down on me, and each time she comes back up, my balls stick to her a little bit, because she's so wet. And I realized I didn't ask her yesterday about birth control and everything, but I was already getting close -""

Fuck, I worked so hard on his cock last night, and he's already close after a few seconds in her?

"" - so I asked if she wanted me to cum in her,"" not where she wanted him to cum, I couldn't help but notice, ""and she started saying 'in me, god I want your cum in me,' and at the same time she reached around and started squeezing my balls, and I came... pretty damn hard, I came in her,"" he finished, somewhat limply.

My mind was a blur. I was imagining the scene. My breath caught in my lungs. I barely noticed his hand was definitely straying higher up my thigh now. I wished it was slip under my shorts and stroke me as he told me about this. I wished he would tell me more about how good she felt.

""How long did you last?"" I asked, starting to stroke his thigh in return, and notice that his cock was swelling again, telling me about fucking my best friend.

""That time? Maybe a minute or two... I was really worked up from last night."" So I had been his fluffer - wait - what?

""That time???""

""Yeah, well,"" he continued, looking me in the eye as his hand slid up, stroking the place where my thigh meets my pussy, millimeter from my outer lips, ""after I came that time, she stayed on me. With me in her. We kissed a bit, I felt her ass, and, well, she noticed I was still hard, hadn't gotten soft, and she started gently moving on me again. Not pulling in and out, just thrusting her hips. She asked if I was too sensitive for what she was doing. And I said no, it felt really good - cuz it did - I was more sensitive from cumming, but it just felt really gentle, and she stopped gripping me as hard with her kegals. I told her I was enjoying what she was doing, but I probably couldn't cum again, and she said that was fine, and just to close my eyes and enjoy myself. So I did. I don't think I moved a muscle. She just slowly moved on me, in different ways, and I just closed my eyes and tried to turn my brain off.""

""And after a little bit, I did actually start feeling something build up, and I think she noticed, because she leaned down and said something like 'you can cum in me again, if you want. I really enjoy your cum in me,' and she just kept on gently encouraging me, telling me it was okay, that she wanted my cum, and when I was getting close, she leaned in and said 'I think it's really sexy having your cum in my completely unprotected pussy. Do you think you'll breed me?'""

Holy shit - I tell Erin too much. She's already playing off his breeding kink?

""And I kind of asked 'what?,' and she leaned down again, and whispered in my ear, 'it's probably safe, but you never know... you might breed my unprotected pussy. And there's not much risk in giving me a second load, is there? So, cum in me, I want your cum in me again.'""

""I was kind of frozen, not really sure what to think, but she felt so good, and I had already cum in her, and before I could decide anything, well, I just kind of lost control, and came I her.""

Sot he night before everything my pussy could do wouldn't get him off, and now, like 5 hours later, he can't control cumming in Erin? I felt like my heart was in a vice. My nerves tingled. It was definitely anxiety and jealousy and shame in my chest, but I wanted it. I loved it. Fuck, what was going on with me?

""I think afterwards she saw the slightly worried look on my face, and said 'use your brain, you felt the nuva ring in me for birth control last night - I just snuck it out when I was climbing on to you, thought I'd have some fun.' And we were both kind of laughing and chatting, she stayed on me as my dick was getting soft, and, well, was climbing off of me when you came in."" With these last words he slipped his thumb past my outer lips, feeling the wetness of my slit. ""Holy shit, you like what you hear?"" he asked.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

So there I was - sitting in a tent with my best friend, Erin, comforting her because my husband George had just given her so much pleasure that she had almost come for the first time in her life. To her credit, she actually calmed down pretty quickly.

""I should go tell him I'm sorry,"" Erin said, ""I should have warned him. The one or two other times I think I was getting close to really cumming, something like that happened. It's never been with someone else... and frankly I didn't really believe you when you said he was that good.""

""Well then you have no one to blame but yourself, then,"" I chirped, giving her a little poke. She started laughing, the tears still on her cheek. Erin was still extremely cute as she approached 30. She had a compact, strong body, maybe 5'4"", with brown hair reaching down to her shoulders, cute B-cup breasts that still stood perky with small brown nipples. She hiked a lot and you could see that in her body: she was slim and strong but had a thin layer of fat that accentuated her hips and breasts. And, right now, she had a kind of unkempt thick brown bush that nonetheless left her labia fully exposed. Seeing her cute pussy, lips still red and wet from what George had been doing to her sent a surge of desire through me.

""I feel bad,"" she said, wiping the tears away with a smile, ""I bet George is feeling miserable.""

""Oh, I'm sure he had his fun..."" I responded.

""I don't know, he seemed really focused on my pleasure, his cock was probably only in me for about five minutes of that whole time. The rest was his hands, and his tongue, his fingers, and he definitely didn't get off. God, the way he wraps his lips around your clit, did you teach him that? That's what almost pushed me over the edge.""

I had just cum, but sitting here, holding my best friend, seeing her naked body, still drenched with sweat from the fucking she had gotten on this warm summer night, and talking about how my husband had literally broken her brain by making her feel so good - I was getting incredibly aroused again.

We spent the rest of the evening debriefing what had happened: George had started really slowly, undressing Erin, kissing her, exploring her body. She started squiring in my arms as she described how she felt when he took her bra off, and took his nipple in her mouth, swirling his tongue around it. Once he got her fully undressed he went down on her, gently licking her clit before moving the hood and tonguing it more directly. He started fingering her, but then she got impatient and wanted his cock. She climbed on top of him - and this was what I saw through the thin tent wall - them sitting up, her legs wrapped around him.

""And I was just kind of bucking on his cock..."" she told me, ""And each time I thrust my clit would rub against him. And I felt his cock start to twitch a little bit. And I realized his cock was bare, and thought about how I hadn't had a bare cock in so long, it's been years, and he might cum in me. And I felt this feeling build up in me, and I felt out of control, and I couldn't stop bucking on him, and then the feeling morphed into just being completely overwhelmed, so I burst out crying. He stopped, held me, I eventually managed to get off his cock... and that's when you found me.""

""Do you want to try again?"" I tried to keep my voice calm, but I could feel my heart pounding. I wanted her to.

""Would you be okay with it?""

""Yes."" I replied too quickly, ""I mean, I think it's a tragedy that you're almost 30 and have never cum. And if anyone can get you there, George can.""

""But this is just going to happen again. It's happened every time, even when I'm alone. I just don't know what will be different.""

""Maybe,"" the my voice caught in excitement, ""if you have something else to distract you, keep you calm, make you feel safe...""

""What?"" she asked with a chuckle, ""have a soothing meditation podcast in my ear while your husband is wearing me like a puppet?""

""Well, I mean, do I make you feel safe?"" I asked, my voice quiet, gently stroking her hair.

""Yes,"" she said, looking up at me with those emerald green eyes. ""Are you saying, you want to be there while you're husband fucks me?""

I almost couldn't catch my breath with excitement. ""Well, I could do what I'm doing now. Keep you kind of distracted. Make you feel safe. Stroke your hair..."" ... kiss you. Touch your pussy. Lick your nipples. God it has been so long since I've been with a woman... ""... make you feel safe.""

Erin told me she would think about it, but needed some rest. We laid out a sleeping bag - it was a warm night, and that would be too warm probably, and nestled up to go to sleep. Erin still naked, me in my panties and tank top.

Erin dropped right off. I... struggled. I fidgeted, rubbing my legs against each other. I kept looking over at her, skin pale in the dim moonlight coming through the tent's mesh window. She shifted, laying on her side with her back to me, letting me admire her curves, my eyes tracing down her back to the cup of her ass. I slipped my hand in my panties, and closed my eyes, holding my breath as I slowly rubbed my clit in gentle circles. The feeling was electric. Having to be quiet made it even more so. But I couldn't quite get myself there. I was dripping wet, but my mind was flying all over the place: remembering how George felt inside of me, the image of their bodies writhing together, imagining having a threesome with the two of them where Erin got her first orgasm.

I edged over closer to Erin, me lying on my back, her on her side with her back to me. I laid my free hand next to me, in the space between us. Then I felt it creeping. Moving slowly towards her. I felt the heat from her skin, and the back of my finger slowly brushed against her ass, as I rubbed myself, desperate for release.

And then I snapped out of it. What the fuck was I doing? Touching my best friends as while she slept? I mean, I know she wouldn't mind - she's the kind of person who would go down on a friend as a favor, and we've hooked up before - but that's not the point. Not my decision to make. I was so horny I was making stupid, stupid decisions.

And I said no, it felt really good - cuz it did - I was more sensitive from cumming, but it just felt really gentle, and she stopped gripping me as hard with her kegals. I told her I was enjoying what she was doing, but I probably couldn't cum again, and she said that was fine, and just to close my eyes and enjoy myself. So I did. I don't think I moved a muscle. She just slowly moved on me, in different ways, and I just closed my eyes and tried to turn my brain off.""

""And after a little bit, I did actually start feeling something build up, and I think she noticed, because she leaned down and said something like 'you can cum in me again, if you want. I really enjoy your cum in me,' and she just kept on gently encouraging me, telling me it was okay, that she wanted my cum, and when I was getting close, she leaned in and said 'I think it's really sexy having your cum in my completely unprotected pussy. Do you think you'll breed me?'""

Holy shit - I tell Erin too much. She's already playing off his breeding kink?

""And I kind of asked 'what?,' and she leaned down again, and whispered in my ear, 'it's probably safe, but you never know... you might breed my unprotected pussy. And there's not much risk in giving me a second load, is there? So, cum in me, I want your cum in me again.'""

""I was kind of frozen, not really sure what to think, but she felt so good, and I had already cum in her, and before I could decide anything, well, I just kind of lost control, and came I her.""

Sot he night before everything my pussy could do wouldn't get him off, and now, like 5 hours later, he can't control cumming in Erin? I felt like my heart was in a vice. My nerves tingled. It was definitely anxiety and jealousy and shame in my chest, but I wanted it. I loved it. Fuck, what was going on with me?

""I think afterwards she saw the slightly worried look on my face, and said 'use your brain, you felt the nuva ring in me for birth control last night - I just snuck it out when I was climbing on to you, thought I'd have some fun.' And we were both kind of laughing and chatting, she stayed on me as my dick was getting soft, and, well, was climbing off of me when you came in."" With these last words he slipped his thumb past my outer lips, feeling the wetness of my slit. ""Holy shit, you like what you hear?"" he asked.",,2025-08-15T18:52:35.653108,3918,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-loving-husband-ch-19,The Loving Husband Ch. 19,Unknown Author,,,,,"The short synopsis of this story to date is included below, but reading the previous chapters may help. Also, in this chapter, I explore something that was recommended by a reviewer.

*****

This is the continuing story of a cuckquean, my wife, Ann. She had been reading cuckold stories on line and decided that she was a cuckquean, a kind of female cuckold. This was based on how enthralled and excited she became by imagining me having sex with other women. I was shocked, but she pursued it. She didn't show any tendencies toward the humiliation or denial part, but loved knowing I was having sex with other women. Apparently, this started with some voyeuristic tendencies about watching someone she was involved with have sex with another woman when she was in college and now she got off on thinking I was having sex with other women. I didn't understand it, but she pursued it and I started doing so.

In the last chapter, I welcomed Mary back to work, but she got an offer from a senior VP, so I was going to have to find another admin assistant. Then my wife, Ann, invited the voluptuous Anita over to make a movie. She wanted another movie of me fucking someone. But it turned out rather tame in her mind, so then we went over to Anita's house where we learned that Bob had a fantasy of seeing her fucked by another guy. He really got into and pushed her and then let Ann jerk him off all over his wife's tits while I fucked her and filled her with cum. It turned out that he was really pushing her to be slutty. It was a great night.

---

For a couple of days, I came home to find Ann busy with the kids and we'd work on getting them through sports, homework, etc. Once they were in bed, Ann was a firecracker. She loved hearing me retell our time with Anita and Bob. When I got to the part where Bob called Anita a slut and pushed her limits while she was fucking me, Ann would cum every time.

Soon, however, we were back to barely keeping up with the kids and having any energy left by the time they were down. We got to one point where we hadn't had sex or fun in about a week. Finally, one Friday, Ann told me that her parents were coming over to pick up the kids on Saturday morning and keep them until Sunday afternoon.

That night, Ann got busy after getting ready for bed. She seemed especially turned on and when I asked her what was going on, she said she arranged for some fun tomorrow. I couldn't argue with either her being horny or having fun with others, so we had a very vigorous evening. She seemed particularly pleased with the way I teased her pussy and clit with my tongue, making her wait for a while before I let her cum.

On Saturday, we got the kids up and ready for a day with the grandparents. They were jumping for joy. Their grandparents bought them whatever they wanted, took them wherever they wanted to go, and let them do whatever they wanted. Well, maybe it wasn't that bad, but it was close!

The kids were gone by 10am and Ann and I relaxed and picked up a few things. At noon, the doorbell rang. Ann told me to stay put since it was a surprise. So I waited. Ann came back and said I had to wait a little longer after the first delivery. Delivery? What the hell did that mean?

About 15 minutes later the doorbell rang again. This time, Ann led a young woman that I hadn't seen in a while into the kitchen.

""Jessica! How good to see you again."" The young redhead was wearing a tight white sleeveless top and tight jean shorts.

""Hey, John."" Jessica grinned and came over to give me a hug. I pulled her in and gave her a hug with my right hand squarely on her left butt cheek. She chuckled and looked over at my wife. ""I can't tell you how surprised I was when your wife told me that that was a setup the last time I was here babysitting.""

""Yeah, but your reaction was interesting.""

""Ha, ha. I was pretty scared at first. You guys had me thinking I was in real trouble.""

""Well, you weren't. It was just a practical joke.""

""Well, Ann tells me you guys are going to make it up to me today.""

Now it was my turn to grin at the two of them. ""I certainly hope so.""

Ann turned to Jessica. ""So are you ready?""

I turned to Ann. ""Ready for what?""

Ann grinned. ""Well, you need to go upstairs and make sure you are nice and clean, right Jessica?""

""Yep.""

I narrowed my eyes at the two of them. ""What's going on here?""

Ann giggled. ""Okay, I'll tell you. You and Jessica have been hired to do another modeling gig for Kathy's line of erotic clothing.""

I looked back and forth between the two of them. ""Where?""

Ann pointed left toward the living room. ""Right here. Kathy arranged to bring three of her favorite female customers here."" Ann looked at her watch. ""They should be here in about 15 minutes.""

Jessica held her hand out. ""Come on, John. Let's go upstairs and get ready.""

I looked down. ""I'm not ready?""

Jessica shook her head. ""Ann told me to make sure to make sure you were trimmed close. She wants to show off your equipment.""

I looked over at Ann and she smiled and shrugged, so I took Jessica's hand and she led me for the stairs.

""Hey!"" Ann yelled at us and we both turned. ""Don't play! You need to be ready for modeling.""

Jessica grinned. ""I know. I'll take it easy on him.""

I shook my head. ""Gee, thanks.""

We went upstairs. I went to the bedroom and started stripping. Jessica just watched. I finished undressing and stood in front of her naked.

Jessica grinned. ""You have a nice cock, John, but let's shorten the hair around your cock and balls.""

My cock responded with a little twitch and started filling with blood at the frankness of Jessica's remarks. I grinned.

Jessica shook her head and looked at my cock. ""Those things really do have a mind of their own, don't they?"" I just shrugged. Jessica reached out and grabbed my cock. ""This way, please.""

Jessica led me into the bathroom where my wife had put out my electric trimmers. Jessica picked them up and dialed in the setting she wanted. ""Step into here."" Jessica pointed to the shower. ""Then we can just wash the hair down the drain.""

I stepped into the shower and Jessica toed off her shoes and stepped in, too. She reached down and lifted up my balls. ""Put your foot up on the side."" I did and Jessica went to work trimming around my balls. She continued to hold my cock and it hardened. Jessica then released my cock and moved my balls around as she trimmed. She got most of it from my balls and my legs leading to my balls, which was already pretty short, but needed to be trimmed a little closer. She then grabbed my cock and moved it around as she took care of what was around the base of my cock. It was barely showing, but she trimmed it much closer.

When she was done, Jessica moved everything around to check her job and cleaned up a couple of spaces. ""There."" She smiled up at me. ""Much better.""

Jessica pulled down the showerhead and turned the water on. Once it was warm, she rinsed me off from the waist down and put it back. She then got a towel and dried my ass and junk. ""Now, step out onto the mat."" I did and she dried off my legs and feet. Jessica turned and grabbed the lotion that was on the sink, she squirted some into her hands and massaged it into everywhere she shaved. My cock got hard again. Jessica grinned and gave my cock a light slap. ""Not now. Let's get ready for the show. The clothes we're showing today are in the guest bedroom. Kathy should have put them in there already.""

I just wrapped a towel around my waist and we made our way to the guest bedroom. There were several boxes in there and Kathy was just finishing depositing them.

""Hey, guys."" Kathy turned and eyed us up and down. ""Nice."" She turned to a paper on the bed. ""There are 4 outfits here and I have them in numbered boxes. I also have them listed on this paper. Any questions?""

""I think we're good."" I turned to Jessica and she was already looking in box number 1.

""I'll call you in a little while. Let's get the ladies get a little more lubricated."" She winked at us, making the sign for drinking, and left.

Jessica put the first box on the bed and we pulled out the outfits. Her's was in several pieces. It included a black latex bra and panty set, the panties in thong style, some black hold up stockings, and black 5"" heels. Mine was a set of black latex shorts, a black net tank top, and black sandals.

Jessica grinned and just stripped. I watched with interest as her beautiful, pink-nippled tits came into view. Then her completely shaved snatch followed. It wasn't until she was ready that I realized I hadn't started. I dropped my towel and got dressed. We sat there for a couple of minutes while I tried not to attack the delicious little treat sitting next to me and then Kathy called us down. We stood and Jessica led the way. Her ass looked delectable in that thong.

When we got downstairs we were met by stares and giggles. I could tell the ladies had been drinking, but they must have had a couple even before they got here. There were 5. Among them were Ann and Anita. That left three others that I didn't recognize. I noticed that Ann was wearing a short skirt and blouse, with no bra. Anita was wearing a sun dress. It was also not as opaque as it should have been. The other three ladies were all in skirts and blouses and they were all in their thirties and good-looking. There were two brunettes who looked to be in good shape and a redhead with large, pushed up tits. She grinned at me as she looked me up and down and I stared at her tits. Nice!

Kathy announced us and described Jessica's outfit. She ran her hands over her latex covered tits as she described the feeling of wearing latex. Jessica just grinned. After she finished, Kathy turned to me. She described the top and then the fact that the shorts were latex. ""Now as you can see, this latex outlines a man's package pretty well."" Kathy ran her hands over my cock and it came to life a little more. The shorts were very tight, so it was well outlined. She grabbed my arm and made sure I turned. ""And the back. Whew! It really outlines how nice and firm a man's ass is."" She grabbed both my cheeks and played with them. I knew this kind of thing might happen, but this was pretty demonstrative and this was the first outfit.

""Okay, ladies, should we go onto the next outfit?"" There was a murmuring of approval and Jessica and I went back upstairs.

The second box contained ""sleepwear"". Although it appeared that the idea was to stimulate the partner to the point of having it removed rather than be comfortable for sleep. Jessica's was a very small pair of panties and a kind of silky top with spaghetti straps. The garment was opaque, but very thin. As she put it on, she grinned at me and shook her tits. The nipples were highly defined in the top. We had been keeping it professional so far.

I removed my leather shorts and net top and found silky sleep shorts that were very brief. They were also tight enough to pull tight against my cock. Jessica came over and rubbed it, making it harder and stand out more. I grinned and gave her a nice open handed slap on her ass. She jumped and yelped and then giggled and headed for the door.

When we got downstairs, Kathy again went through her description of the fabrics, sizes, and other information about our wardrobe, or lack thereof. Then she asked any of the women if they wanted to feel the fabric. They nodded and so Kathy took Jessica and paraded her in front of the somewhat boisterous group.

Ann was first and just felt the fabric of the top between her fingers. Then came Anita and she ran her hand up Jessica's leg along the back and up onto her ass. Jessica giggled and the other women laughed. Next was the first brunette. Kathy called her Betty. Betty carefully felt it the same way Ann did. The redhead came next and she reached up and ran her right hand over Jessica's tit. Jessica moaned a little and the ladies giggled, and the redhead took her hand away with a little blush. The other ladies were calling her Violet. At the last brunette, named Rhonda, Jessica was again rubbed and felt up, this time on her crotch. She squirmed as Rhonda felt her up. Rhonda stared up at her as she did so, seemingly challenging her to do something.

Then Kathy turned to me and grinned. I knew it was coming, too. These ladies were well on their way to being drunk and were enjoying fondling the models. Ann only felt my ass briefly, but Anita grabbed my cock through the shorts, stroking it. It hardened immediately. The other ladies were watching closely and I could see the redhead lick her lips. Anita let me go and Betty took over. She also rubbed my cock, trying to gauge its length. Then it was time for the redhead. She sat forward and ran one hand over my ass. She didn't try to feel my cock but she started at it hungrily. After about 15 seconds, Kathy told her to let me move on. The last woman, Rhonda, just grabbed my cock and stared for a few seconds. Then she let it go.

Kathy told us to go straight to the last outfit as we turned for the stairs.

Jessica and I went upstairs and I followed her closely, my face almost in her ass. I was getting so fucking horny.

When we got there, Jessica immediately ripped of her outfit and rubbed her pussy. ""I'm trying to be good, but I'm really fucking horny.""

""Me, too."" I pulled down my shorts and my cock popped free. Jessica stared at it like a starving cheetah.

She opened the last box and giggled. She first held up my item. It was hilarious. It looked like a man's G-string, skintight, with a large cock holder or cock sock in the front. She held it up. ""You think it will fit?""

""Of course.""

""Yeah, but an erection might push it away from your body a little.""

""I think that's the point. Now, let's see what you have.""

Jessica held up her outfit. It was some kind of harness type contraction. It had straps and chains that would go around your chest and outline it perfectly, with the nipples sticking out in the middle of two rings. The bottom had straps that went around between the legs, but on the outside of the pussy, leaving it completely exposed. Jessica put it against her body. ""Holy fuck! This is going to be interesting.""

We dressed. My cock started going down so Jessica stroked it, making sure it was hard. I returned the favor by sucking on her nipples, making them hard and pointy. I also rubbed her pussy and found it wet.

Jessica pushed me away. ""Enough or I'm going to fuck you right here.""

I stepped back and waved toward the door. ""After you, my slutty lady.""

Jessica gave a snort and walked out. I followed.

When we came into view, they ladies all looked up and stared. Ann was the only one who said anything out loud. ""Now that's fucking hot!""

As we approached, Kathy described the merchandise. She described Jessica's first as she directed us to stand in front of the group. ""Jessica is wearing a black body harness bra and panty set. You'll notice that it's all latex straps around and over the boobs with a ring that is positioned over the nipple that the straps attach to."" Kathy reached up and rubbed Jessica's right nipple. ""This leaves the nipples viewable and available for play."" Jessica's nipples hardened again. ""This can be stimulating for both the woman and her partner. Now the bottom is similarly made of the latex straps and the straps go under on either side of the pussy, leaving it available for viewing and play, also."" Kathy ran her fingers under and through Jessica's pussy. Jessica gave a sharp intake of breath and I could see the women were also becoming aroused. Kathy held up her hand. It was wet. ""And, as you can see, it can be arousing for the wearer if she likes showing off."" Kathy grinned and Jessica smiled.

Now Kathy came to me. ""Now for the man we have the thong sleeve. Turn around John."" I did so. ""Some women like to see their man's ass with a small thong strap in it."" Kathy slapped my right cheek. ""And some like to spank it."" She gave me another whack. ""Now turn back around, John. Good. Now ladies, as you can see, John's cock is in the cock sleeve like a foot in a sock. It highlights the cock and gives it a nice viewable look for his partner."" Kathy reached down and hefted my cock, which was hard enough that it didn't need much lifting. ""This is a nice cock, so it fills the sleeve nicely."" She started stroking me. ""And it's really nice to tease and play with it.""

I stood there, enjoying Kathy playing with my cock, and looked at the women. I don't think I had seen so many staring, hungry looks on the faces of 5 women sitting in a living room. They were all fixated on my cock.

Kathy turned to Jessica and whispered something. Jessica turned to me and stroked me, grinning. The other ladies just watched and stared. Jessica then slid to her knees and I knew that Kathy was getting the party started.

Jessica and I were turned so that the ladies could see us from the side. Jessica looked over at them and grinned as she slowly pulled my thong away from my body and the sleeve off my cock. When she got near the top, she yanked it down, letting my cock slap up against me and bob to a ninety-degree angle, pointed at her face. The ladies all let out sounds of some kind. There was one sharp intake of breath, a couple of sighs, and one, my wife, who muttered something loud enough for all to hear. ""Nice cock!""

Jessica turned and took my cock into her mouth and started sucking. She was a good cock sucker and I liked having it sucked while a bunch of other women were watching. Jessica only sucked for about 30 seconds and then turned to Anita. I guess she was told that she would be easily tempted. ""Come over and suck this cock, you horny, pregnant bitch."" She laughed as she said that and Anita smiled.

In two seconds Anita was on her knees and taking my cock into her mouth. Jessica reached under Anita's dress and when she hit pay dirt, her pussy, Anita groaned as she sucked my cock. Jessica seemed to be fingering her while she sucked me.

Jessica then reached up and pulled Anita off my cock by her hair. ""Stand up."" My cock stood straight out, wet and ready to fuck something. ""Let's get this off."" She grabbed Anita's sundress by the bottom and lifted. It came all the way off leaving her naked; no underwear at all. She was getting a small bulge from being pregnant and her tits looked swollen. Jessica led her to the couch. ""Sit down on the edge, lean back, and pull your legs up. You're going to get fucked first."" Anita obeyed.

When she pulled her legs back, being one of the three ladies on the couch, it got crowded. She was on the left as I stood there, followed by Betty and Violet. When she pulled her legs back, Jessica grabbed Betty's right hand. ""Here, hold this leg for her."" Betty didn't even flinch, but grabbed the leg and held it back and open.

I walked over between Anita's legs. She was completely shaved, very wet, and looked hungry for cock. She ran her hand over her plump lips. ""Since I got pregnant I'm so fucking horny.""

The other ladies seemed a little surprised at this pregnant woman talking so frankly and being so quick to fuck. Then Anita turned to her left where the Betty and Violet were sitting. She assumed that they had kids, too. ""Didn't you get horny as fuck when you were pregnant?""

Betty just sat there and stared. Violet answered. ""Hell, yes. My husband was fucked within an inch of his life when I was pregnant."" Then she looked away, like she was shocked that she said that.

Anita smiled. ""Then you know what I mean. Get over here closer and put his cock in my pussy. Feel that hard cock. It's so good.""

Violet hesitated. I couldn't tell which person she was. The forward one staring at my cock or the one who would suddenly blush when she said something a little too risqué. Jessica helped her out. She reached over and grabbed Violet's arm. ""C'mon. Otherwise, I'm gonna get in there and handle that cock.""",,2025-08-15T18:53:04.914723,3730,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-new-piggy,The New Piggy,Unknown Author,,,,,"Life had become a bit mundane--work, family... the usual distractions getting in the way. My sub was more my partner than my submissive, but that was all about to change.

I had told her to get ready for a night away. Everything had been arranged--there was nothing to worry about. ""Oh, and pack a few toys,"" I had added casually. ""Things might get kinky if the mood strikes.""

What she didn't know was that Suzie was coming.

Suzie--the eager 25-year-old sub I had been training online. She was obedient, eager to please, and followed every rule I set for her. Daily weigh-ins, wearing tight shirts, and jeggings that accentuated her belly--every little detail was followed to perfection. And tonight, she was about to be introduced into something much more real.

As we arrived at the secluded hotel, the air between us was thick with unspoken curiosity. My partner had no idea what was coming, and I reveled in the quiet thrill of it. She trusted me--enough to obey, enough to follow, even if she didn't yet understand what the night held.

I led her to the room, a luxurious suite bathed in soft, ambient light. The bed was neatly made, the space warm yet expectant. She placed her bag down, glancing at me with a mixture of amusement and suspicion.

Then came the knock.

A slow, deliberate rapping at the door. My partner's smiled. ""You ordered room service already?"" she asked with a smirk.

I said nothing, simply crossed the room and opened the door.

And there stood Suzie.

She was exactly as I had trained her to be--standing with her hands clasped behind her back, head slightly bowed, lips painted in a subtle, nervous smile. Dressed in a skin-tight crop top and jeggings, her body was presented exactly as I had instructed. Her soft belly pressed against the fabric, her curves on display, her eagerness tangible.

My partner inhaled sharply, ""what.... who is this?""

""Suzie,"" I said, my voice calm, measured. ""Come in.""

My Partner knew i was training Suzie online, but to meet, in person, unannounced, in a hotel room??

Suzie stepped forward obediently, her eyes flicking up just once--to me, then to my partner--before she lowered them again, standing before us, waiting.

Silence settled in the room, thick with possibilities.

My partner turned to me, searching my face. ""So... what's this?"" Her voice was careful, measured, but I caught the subtle shift in her stance--the way her breathing had changed, the way her fingers twitched at her side.

Suzie didn't move. She only waited, just as she had been trained to do.

I smiled. ""An introduction.""

And the night was only just beginning.

. My partner sat stiffly on the edge of the bed, her lips parted slightly, as if still trying to process what was happening.

Suzie remained on her knees, her back straight but her head lowered--exactly as I had trained her.

I turned to my partner and gestured to the bed with a slow, deliberate flick of my fingers. ""Sit back."" I commnded ""Suzie is here to show you how to be a submissive pig""

She hesitated. I arched a brow.

A test.

She exhaled sharply but complied, shifting back against the pillows, her legs together, shoulders tense.

""Hands under your thighs,"" I ordered.

She blinked. ""What?""

""Sit on your hands. Now.""

Her jaw tensed, her pride warring with her instinct to obey me. But after a beat, she slid her hands beneath her thighs, effectively restraining herself, bound only by her submission to me.

Better.

I turned my attention to Suzie. My perfect, eager little piglet.

Her breath hitched the moment I touched her, my fingers skimming down her cheek before tilting her chin up, forcing her to meet my gaze. Her pupils were wide, her lips parted. I could feel her anticipation, her need to be seen, to be used.

I smirked as my eyes roamed down her body.

""That top,"" I murmured, dragging a finger along the stretched, straining fabric barely covering her soft stomach, ""you remembered my favorite.""

Suzie flushed, her thighs pressing together.

""Stand up,"" I commanded.

She obeyed instantly, rising onto shaky legs. The top rode up slightly, exposing even more of her round, full jelly belly, the soft curve of it pressing against the waistband of her jeggings.

I ran a hand over it, fingers pressing into the flesh, making sure she felt every touch.

""You really are getting fatter,"" I mused, gripping a handful of her softness and giving it a firm, possessive squeeze. ""Look at you. You stuff yourself like a good little pig, don't you?""

Suzie whimpered, nodding quickly.

""You dress like this on purpose, don't you? Wearing these too-tight jeggings just so everyone can see what a greedy little thing you are.""

Her cheeks burned red, her breath coming out in quick, shallow gasps.

""Yes as you wished Sir"" she replied

I glanced over my shoulder at my partner. She was watching. Exactly as I intended.

""Tell her,"" I said to Suzie, my voice sharp.

Suzie swallowed hard, then turned her head slightly toward my partner. Her voice was barely above a whisper.

""I w-wear them because... because I know he likes it.""

""Louder.""

""I wear them because I know he likes it,"" she repeated, voice trembling, but clear.

I hummed in approval, sliding my hands down her stomach, tracing the edge of her waistband before gripping her hips hard enough to make her gasp.

""You know what the difference between you and her is?"" I asked, turning back to my partner.

She remained silent, but her breathing had picked up, her knuckles turning white where she pressed them under her thighs.

I smirked. ""You fight. She doesn't.""

Suzie accepts, Suzie obeys. Suzie knows her place. Suzie is the submissive pig you pretend to be and she does it for me.

I turned back to my little piglet, running a hand down her belly once more, letting my fingers dig into the softness before gripping her chin and making her look at me.

""Say thank you for letting me dress like a fat little pig for you.""

""T-thank you for letting me dress like a fat little pig for you... Sir.""

I smiled. Satisfied.

""Know you brought the goods didnt you?"" I asked, tilting Suzie's chin up so she had no choice but to meet my gaze.

""Y-yes,"" she murmured, quickly retrieving a small box from her bag--glazed doughnuts, just as I had expected.

""Perfect,"" I said smoothly, taking one and holding it just in front of her lips. ""Open.""

She obeyed without hesitation, parting her lips as I pushed the first bite in, watching as she chewed, swallowed, then glanced up at me, awaiting the next.

""You always do what you're told, don't you?"" I mused, smirking as I pressed another piece past her lips, letting my fingers linger just a moment too long. She nodded, eyes flicking briefly to my partner, who was watching with barely contained tension.

I turned then, regarding my partner with a slow, deliberate smirk. ""You see, this is what real obedience looks like.""

Her lips parted slightly, her posture shifting as if she wanted to speak, to protest--or maybe to plead. But she held back, waiting for permission.

""Jealous?"" I asked, tilting my head as I reached for another doughnut, holding it up but not offering it to her.

She swallowed hard. ""I... I can be good too.""

I chuckled, leaning back as I fed Suzie another bite, this time letting my touch graze her lower lip just a little longer. ""We'll see about that.""

3.

Monday morning dawned to find Jack already on the road, his sneakers beating a steady staccato onto the wet pavement. He had pushed on this run, still keeping the distance at a respectable three miles but working to drive his mile time down. He idly wondered why no one else around here was out jogging. There were plenty of lights appearing in windows but not a lot of movement at 6 am.

He saw the women as he rounded the next bend. Both relatively tall, ponytails swinging as they jogged along. As the pair passed under a streetlamp he recognized Debbie from the previous night's adventure. She and her husband had snuck back to their house like teenagers under the cover of darkness after she had given him a deep kiss in parting. Bill had been grinning from ear to ear as he stuck out his hand to take his leave.

It had taken him a moment or two upon awakening to remember and reconstruct yesterday. His morning erection demanded attention, but Jack figured he could find a better use for the load and so opted instead to go for a run.

As the women drew closer he saw Debbie flash a brilliant smile and a quick wave. The blonde woman accompanying her merely nodded with a polite smile and then the two were past him, having received a nod and a smile from him in return.

He was just stepping out of the shower when he heard a knock on the door. Quickly throwing some athletic shorts on but forgoing a shirt he answered the door to find the women on his door step, flushed from their exertion. ""Mondays are running days. Might as well get the worst of it out of the way"" Debbie said with a grin. ""Mind if we come in and cool off? Our husbands are both glued to their respective TV's, eating Eggo's or some other worthless shit.""

Blondie giggled at this. She was almost as tall as Debbie but was pale skinned and her curves were even more pronounced than her friend's. Jack judged her to be a solid D, maybe even DD, cup compared to Debbie's C. Errant strands of hair were plastered to both women's necks, having escaped their ponytails.

""Can I offer you some water? Coffee? Tea?"" asked Jack. ""I also have some fresh fruit, bagels, cream cheese and lox if you'd like to have a bite.""

""Water would be great"" said the blonde. ""I'm Cindy by the way. Debbie told me that she's helping you with decorating and that she and Bill came over yesterday for a swim and some delicious margaritas.""

""Did she now?"" Jack asked. ""Did she say that they had the time of their lives? That's what I was hoping for.""

Debbie blushed but it went unnoticed by Cindy who laughed; a pretty, shiny sound. ""No, she didn't say that. But she said that I should get try to get the same invitation from you for my husband and me if possible.""

""The same one?"" Jack looked pointedly at Debbie whose flush was now complete and was looking demurely at the floor. ""I'd be happy to meet more of the locals. I'm assuming that you live around here?""

""We do, just one street over. My husband is a contractor for the military and will be shipping out along with a deployment for the next three months to maintain his company's systems. Be careful with your invitation: you may not be able to get rid of me. We don't have a pool and the weather is turning hot too early this year.""

Jack's eyes held Cindy's deep blue ones as she spoke, and he tried to make his smolder. Hell, he thought, I just may wind up with a harem. I wonder how many unsatisfied married women a neighborhood can hold.

""I'd be happy to have you and/or your husband over. I'd like to meet him before he ships out. Do you have plans for dinner tonight?"" Jack queried and she replied that they had no plans. ""Great"" he said. ""Why don't you guys come over late this afternoon and we can play in the pool and grill some burgers.""

Cindy said that sounded great but wanted to double check with her husband before he left for work. She gave Debbie a quick hug and the air kisses that so many women do and flounced out the door.

""Call Bill and tell him that you're having breakfast here. He's welcome to come over as well. Then go rinse off."" His voice was calm but had that same new-found authority from yesterday. He found himself slipping into this role easily.

As she grabbed her cell phone he crossed the few feet separating them. He shoved a hand down her pants to find her vagina soaking wet. ""Couldn't even go twelve hours? You're practically dripping"" his fingers teased her and she moaned into the receiver, one hand steadying herself on the island as she spread her legs to give him better access.

""He's not answering"" she gasped as his other hand found her sports bra and pulled it up, releasing her breasts. God they were sexy Jack thought. He loved the way the areolas almost blended into the skin around them and marveled at their size. Sand dollars, he decided.

""Text him then"" and she hastened to comply as he manhandled her body. He pulled her tit with one hand, twisting the nipple he did so. He removed the other hand from her pants and shoved his moistened fingers into her mouth. ""Clean them"" he said and relished in the sensation of her tongue darting between his fingers.

Finished texting, she set the phone down. ""Shower, now. Then come back here"" he directed her.

He watched her move away, enjoying the roll of her hips and ample ass and considered what he wanted to do next. Breakfast would be the most practical thing: his body needed nourishment after last night's activities and this morning's run. But his stiffening rod had other ideas.

Minutes later she stepped back into the room, nude. She hadn't washed her hair, but he hadn't wanted to wait that long. ""On your knees"" he said and she slowly sank down before him. She reached up, just as her husband had done the previous day and slowly slid the pants down to the floor. Her warm hand caressed his balls and she opened her mouth to accept his member. She moaned, her eyes closed as she sucked him deeper into her throat as her other hand flicked between her legs. Jack enjoyed the view, watching his fat cock stretch her pretty mouth. He let her work him to full size and then pulled her to her feet.

""Hands on the island, bend over"" he said coldly. She giggled, wiggling her supple ass back at him. He enjoyed watching the ripples in the meat of her ass and he could see moist lips peeking from between her legs.

He spanked her unexpectedly, hard. It burned his hand and left a distinct outline on her ass. She yelped, pulling away and closing her feet together. ""No"" he commanded. ""I told you to maintain eye contact with me when my cock is down your throat. You didn't, so you'll be punished you cock hungry slut. You touched yourself without asking too."" His hand fell again and again. Her ass was bright red and hot to the touch now.

He paused, caressing her burning flesh before dipping a finger into her canal. She was wetter than before, just as he had hoped. She moaned with the intrusion. ""What did you tell Cindy about us?"" he demanded.

""Nothing really"" she panted. ""I said that we met you yesterday and I thought you would be a good influence on Bill. I said you were a man's man. Big frame, hairy chest, and that you were recently divorced. Maybe I joked about you setting up a harem but that's it.""

""Is that what you want? You want me to have a harem?"" Jack continued to tease her lips, now adding a finger. She writhed under his touch, spreading her legs again and bucking back against his hand.

""Yesss"" she hissed.

""Why?"" He was genuinely curious. He didn't understand why she would want to share him with other women.

""I want them to feel what you did to me last night. I want to watch you take these women and make them your sluts like I am now. They're just as unsatisfied as I was before last night. You can fix that. You can make my friends happy. I want to make them just as fulfilled"" she replied, soft moans mixed in with her words.

""Tell me about Cindy"" he directed.

""Her husband is fat. He's lazy. She says that he has the tiniest dick she's ever seen. I think it must be a micropenis."" Her voice had an edge and he could tell that she genuinely disliked the guy.

He removed his fingers and traced them upwards, circling her rosebud, then pushing the tip of one in.

""Ohhh"" she moaned and pushed back against him again.

""Touch yourself"" he said and her hand dropped from the counter and disappeared between her legs as he worked his finger in and out of her ass. ""Are you bisexual?"" he asked.

""I don't think so. At least not really. I've never really done anything with a woman before, but I find some women attractive."" Her response, while not what he had quite hoped for was encouraging nevertheless.

He decided to push. New Jack pushed when he felt like it. Slipping another finger into her tight ring elicited another, louder moan. ""You will help me bed these women. You will suck me hard for them. You will watch as I give them your stolen orgasms you dirty slut. You'll watch as I wreck their tight snatches and the first time you taste my cum will be out of one of your friend's pussies."" His words and the mental images drove her over the edge and he felt her tighten against his hands and shudder as an orgasm washed over her. ""Tell me"" he said. ""Tell me you'll do it.""

""Yes"" she gasped. ""Your cum, their pussies, all of their pussies. Their asses. Wherever. I need it."" The words were disjointed but Jack felt his flagging erection return to full mast with her affirmation. He had definitely picked the right neighborhood.

He stood, moving behind her. ""Spread your ass for me. Ask, no beg, me to fuck you in your married ass."" His words felt cold in his mouth yet somehow natural.

""Please"" she gasped. ""Please fuck my married ass. Stretch it like my husband can't. Make me scream. Take what you want.""

Her hands pulled her voluptuous cheeks apart, fingers sinking into the layer of fat. Her ass still glowed from her spanking, and he positioned himself, sliding into her tight cunt first to lube himself up. God she was tight. Bill's skinny prick hadn't done much to loosen her up over the years. She moaned and gasped as he stroked in and out a few times, thoroughly coating his shaft. He withdrew and placed the crown of his cock over her hole, the only one left to claim as his own. He heard her gasp and a small cry escaped her lips as the crown of his cock popped through her tight ring.

She let go of her cheeks, bracing herself against the island for support. He rocked his way into her ass, inch by fat inch until his cock was completely buried in her. He felt her fingers worrying her clit, occasionally brushing his balls. ""So full"" she murmured. ""Never before, ugh.""

He eased back then slid all of the way in again. He could see their reflections in the window. Her head was bowed down and her tits swung enticingly as he began to piston in and out of her faster. Her cries of discomfort soon turned to moans of pleasure. He slapped her ass a few more times to bring the red back out and felt himself coming close to his own orgasm.

Wanting more, he withdrew and grabbed a stool, placing it next to the island. ""Get up"" he said and she turned, resting her burning ass on the seat. Her legs were spread and her tits hung, slightly drooping off the sides of her chest. He shifted her forward in the seat a bit, exposing her previously tight anal ring that now gaped slightly. He shoved his hard cock back into her ass and watched her face contort with pleasure and pain.

""Cum for me. Cum with my cock buried deep in your married ass. Cum while you feel me fill you up."" His words were growls and her face was a mask of ecstasy. He slapped a tit with the flat of his hand and her moan of approval brought him right back to the edge. Again his hand fell and then she was cumming, spraying him again, clenching hard on his cock, driving him to his own release. With a roar Jack unloaded, spraying her bowels with his seed.

She slumped back as he slowed, a light sheen of sweat on her chest. When he removed his cock her ass was truly gaping. He watched it pulse, re-forming now that the violent intruder was gone as his cum profusely leaked out of her wrecked hole.

""Your job now is to make sure I'm balls deep in Cindy tonight. I don't care how you do it, just make it happen.""

She looked at him, still panting slightly. ""I'll do it. I'll make it happen.""

Debbie left after dressing and grabbing a bagel on her way out the door. Jack cleaned up and set about catching up on email and then making a run to the local mall for some more Florida-appropriate attire. He didn't think swimming in his boxers two days in a row would go over so well. He also stocked up on margarita supplies, figuring that if Debbie was using that as a selling point he had better be able to deliver.

He spent some time on the backyard in the afternoon, mowing, pruning, and ensuring the pool and hot tub were ready to go. He was sweaty and grimy when his phone alerted him to a text message.

Debbie: It's all set. You just be yourself.

Jack smiled to himself. This was entirely too easy.

His doorbell chimed at 4 pm and he opened it to find Cindy and who he presumed was her husband on the step. ""Hi neighbor!"" she said in a bubbly voice. ""Thanks again for having us over. I think Debbie is taking it as a personal challenge to integrate you to the neighborhood as quickly as possible. She mentioned that she thinks your place will become party central this summer.""

Jack rolled his eyes in mock despair. ""Come on in. I'm Jack"" he said as he turned to the man and offered his hand.

""Max"" was the reply and the handshake was complete. Max was a portly fellow Jack decided. Probably a combination of unlucky genes and an unhealthy lifestyle. His reddish brown hair was thinning but what drew Jack's eye was the bulge of his gut that pressed against the sides of a shirt that was too large for him in the shoulder.

""Nice to meet you Max. I saw Cindy and Debbie out running while I was on my morning jog and Debbie decided to stop by an introduce us once they were done. Come on out back, I think I've got us all set up."" As he ushered them in he realized that he agreed with Debbie: Max wasn't someone he wanted to spend much time with. He seemed standoffish and had an air of entitlement that rubbed Jack the wrong way.

Cindy more than made up for Max's dour personality. She gushed over the yard, the pool, the hot tub, and the bar while Max was sullenly silent. She was easy to talk to and the three of them grabbed drinks at the bar, Jack following Cindy back to the lounge chairs where the trouble had begun yesterday. He didn't notice Max staying behind at first until Cindy mentioned it.

""Aren't you coming? What are you doing?"" she called to him.

""I'm going to stay here in the shade"" was his monotone reply.

Cindy rolled her eyes. She ignored him and stripped off her sundress to reveal a deep blue bikini that perfectly matched her eyes. Jack commented on this and Cindy blushed, smiling coyly at him.

""Thank you for noticing. I'm glad someone is willing to pay attention to me."" Her tone was thankful, remorseful, and resentful all at once. Jack was always amazed that women could pull stuff like that off.

""Well, it looks fantastic"" and it really did to Jack. While not as skimpy as Debbie's white one from yesterday it was certainly revealing enough that Jack's mind wandered and wondered what Debbie had planned.

As if on cue he heard the doorbell chime. Excusing himself, he went to the door to find Debbie in the same sheer wrap from yesterday. She grinned up at him like the Cheshire cat. ""Having fun yet?""

He grabbed her shoulders and pushed her to her knees. He pushed his suit down while wrapping his other hand in her hair. He fed her his soft cock, feeling it harden in her mouth under the attention of her tongue. He began to fuck her face and she gagged on his cock, spittle coating his balls. He stood her up abruptly, tucking himself away. Pulling the wrap away from her body he spanker her ass, once, hard, and made sure it was in a spot that clearly showed the imprint of his fingers.

""Your friends are waiting for you"" he said, gesturing to the patio and handing her the wrap. She looked a mess. Her hair was tousled, and her lipstick smudged. Her smile, however, was radiant. She strode away, wearing a black bikini that was the twin of the white one from the day before.

He followed her, his bathing suit still tented but at least he wasn't sticking up out of the top. He watched her undulating ass roll before him and could clearly see the marks from his fingers across the bottom of her lower right cheek. Max had figured out how to work the TV over the bar and was focused on a baseball game. Jack couldn't believe how engrossed he was, as Max only turned around briefly when the women shrieked their delight at seeing one another.

""Bill got called down to Miami and will be there for a few days. I figured I'd crash the party that I wasn't invited to earlier"" Debbie said to Cindy. Max's phone rang while she spoke and he answered, oblivious to the trio's conversation.

""You're welcome here anytime"" Jack said. ""Too bad about Bill. I was looking forward to seeing him again. He's a very accommodating guy.""

Cindy was sitting back in a lounge chair and Debbie turned to face Jack as he spoke. Jack saw Cindy's eyes widen as she saw the fingerprints on her friend's ass. ""Shipping out tonight, I've got to be in Tampa by 10"" Max interrupted.

""Well, I guess it's nice that we get to relax this afternoon before you have to go sweety"" Cindy intoned. ""This set up is simply divine Jack.""

""I'll get the grill going so we can eat a bit early"" Jack offered.

""No, no, let's swim first"" Debbie pleaded, grabbing Cindy's hand. ""Come on Max, let's play chicken. Who do you want on your shoulders? You pick.""

Jack saw a flash of greed in Max's eyes. ""I want you"" he said to Debbie and kicked his shoes off before walking to the pool. Jack realized the asshat was going to swim with his shirt on. What a piece of work.

""May I?"" Jack asked, holding a hand out to Cindy. She blushed again, taking his hand and rising before they made their way to the pool's edge.

""Cannonball!"" Debbie's cry caught Jack off guard and he turned just in time to see her hurtle through the air and land with an excellent splash that soaked both he and Cindy. Max was walking down the steps in the shallow end. Cindy pushed Jack while he was distracted and he tumbled into the cool water. He emerged in time to be drowned in the splash of Cindy's own cannonball and when he finally emerged again it was to the pealing laughter of both women. A quick glance at Max showed his sullen mood had returned.

""All right Max. Get over here and let's teach these two a lesson!"" Debbie's war cry did little to change Max's expression, but he joined her nevertheless.

""Ready?"" Jack asked Cindy, momentarily distracted by her deep cleavage.

""I think so"" she said. He had been caught, red handed. Her shy smile told him that all was not lost though. Jack ducked under the water and felt her climb onto his shoulders. Her thighs were silky, womanly, and soft under his fingers. He stood and felt the thin triangle of fabric covering her sex press against his neck. His cock stiffened slightly under the water.

Max had managed to get Debbie up on his shoulders but was having trouble balancing with her weight. He moved to deeper water and then Jack charged. Cindy shrieked, grabbing his hair and face, crushing her breasts into his head. She released him as they reached the other pair and grabbed Debbie, pulling her forward. Debbie fought back, leaning backward but the sudden change of weight distribution was too much for Max and they went down.

""Again!"" Debbie came up sputtering. Max looked like he didn't want to play anymore but acquiesced. They were soon back up and grappling. Max did a better job this time and as the two girls grappled Cindy inadvertently (or maybe not) pulled Debbie's bikini top, freeing those beautiful tits.",,2025-08-15T18:53:25.130815,3712,
https://www.literotica.com/s/all-hail-the-quean-ch-01,All Hail the Quean Ch. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"I always knew when Micheal would sneak out of bed to relieve himself. He would leave the bathroom door cracked ever so slightly so he wouldn't wake me by the sound of the door shutting, but I had always been a light sleeper. Even the sliver of light cutting through the darkness of our master bedroom would be enough to wake me from even the deepest sleep. I pushed the goose down comforter and silk sheet aside, I snaked my way to the edge of our king sized bed to tiptoe to the bathroom.

Through the crack I could see my husband standing before the toilet, his phone precariously propped up on the towel rack just above it. His muscles rippled beneath his sun-kissed skin as he tugged on his cock to the video that played on the tiny screen.

""Mmm... your cock feels so good in my tight little pussy!"" The girl moaned as she bounced on a dildo. ""You like my tight little pussy?""

""Yeah..."" Micheal whispered back to the video, his arm jerking slightly faster than before.

My pussy began to throb with a heartbeat of its own as I watched from the darkness. I hid against the door and slid my hand under the elastic of my panties, gently caressing the swollen pearl between my legs to calm it.

""You gonna cum? You wanna cum inside me?""

Micheal groaned under his breath another response as he tugged faster, his hand making a quiet slapping against his skin.

It had been a long time since it had a release of its own, intimacy having been slowly reduced to our anniversary and special occasions over the 24 years of marriage. He would tell me that he didn't have the drive that he once had when we were younger, but I know that isn't the reason.

My pussy was slick with my juices as I slid my fingers up and down my slit and I continued to watch my husband masturbate to the beautiful woman on the screen. He uttered responses to her dirty talk, his hand gliding in tandem with the speed at which she rode the silicone cock.

""OH, god! That's it! Breed me, daddy!"" The video girl began to bounce her ass vigorously down on the dildo faster, grinding her hips in a circular motion on the silicone as fake cum shot out of the toy inside her. She moaned, satisfied, lifting herself off the toy and pushing the fake cum out of her pussy in fat globs.

""Fuck!"" Micheal groaned, releasing his load into the toilet in four powerful spurts. His cock visibly throbbing with each pulse.

The way he groaned with pleasure and the way his cock pulsed with such force was enough to send me over the edge. My legs shook with the force of my climax and my other hand over my mouth to stifle my moan of pleasure from letting him know that I had watched him.

""Hope I don't get pregnant!"" The girl giggled as the video faded to black followed by a message saying to like and subscribe before ending completely.

Micheal stood for a moment, moaning quietly and stroking his dick slowly as it deflated in his hand before flushing his spunk and side stepping to the sink to clean up.

I tiptoed back to the bed and laid in the darkness just as I had before and it wasn't long before Micheal rejoined me, sliding across to cuddle none the wiser that I had witnessed his secret pleasure to satisfy my own.

-- -- -- -- -- --

Neither of us brought up the night before at breakfast as if it hadn't happened. We would ask how the other slept, discuss what our plans were for the day. And though it was the same song and dance we had done for the last 5 or 6 years, there certainly wasn't a shortage of love between us. Micheal would slide in flattery into our conversations at every chance, flashing me his stunning smile all the while never taking his hazel eyes off me.

He was just as beautiful as the day we first met back in college. Though his dark hair was now flecked with an attractive amount of salt and fine lines creased around his eyes when he smiled, it was as if he never aged. He was fit, his muscles visible even under his shirt from frequently swimming in our pool and spending time in our home gym. Even the shadow of his stubble added to his beauty. Flashing me another stunning smile, he said, ""I think I'm going to stay home and watch the game today.""

""I'm going to go check on things at the office,"" I decided, returning the smile. We owned a business together and having no children, we were able to build it up to the point where it needed little oversight by us but I would go when I needed time away from the house.

My mind flashed to the thought of him hunched over another woman, driving deep thrusts into her causing me to choke on the drink of orange juice I had just taken. He looked concerned as I gasped and straightened myself out enough to placate his worry.

After breakfast, I quickly got dressed in a simple black pencil skirt and silk lilac blouse. He walked me to the door, giving me a firm kiss on the lips, a gentle pat on the bottom and wished me a safe drive as I left.

I drove to the office in silence. The thought that had perverted our meal swirling in my mind made me question the reason behind it. I had been watching my husband relieve himself in secret for the better part of 5 years and never before had I imagined him having sex with someone else. I thought it was simply the act of him cumming that aroused me, but perhaps it was more than that. I recalled the night prior. The way that he stroked himself in tandem with the movements of the girl in the video; the way he responded to her dirty talk as if she were in the room with him. He was imagining himself fucking her. I could feel the moisture building between my legs as I came to the realization that I liked the thought of him imagining himself with another woman.

The rest of the day droned after that. In quiet moments I allowed myself to expand on the fantasy from breakfast. Imagining Michael kissing, sucking, licking and fucking another woman until he eventually filled her with his hot cum. All of it aroused me more than watching him masterbate ever had, causing my clit to pulse with anticipation of a release by the end of the day and I knew I had to make this happen somehow.

I knew that Micheal wouldn't be keen on the idea even if it was something he wanted deep down. He loved me too much to agree to, essentially, consensually cheating. At least not outright. I had to find a way to have it happen organically or it just wouldn't have the same appeal.

The drive home was agonizing with the ache that emanated from between my legs as I mulled over ideas on how to make my fantasy a reality. When I entered our home so lost in thought, I almost didn't hear the unmistakable sound of moaning coming from the living room. It quickly changed to loud cheering overlaid by an announcer excitedly recapping the previous goal made by some sports team.

Micheal sat in the center of the couch, one arm draped over the back and the other holding a pillow to his lap as he watched the team's kick the ball back and forth across the screen. His swim trunks lay in a crumpled, wet pile just inside the patio door. He looked over his shoulder as I walked into the room and greeted me with a sheepish grin.

I'm not sure what came over me at that moment, but as I approached the back of the couch to give him a kiss, I grabbed the TV remote and pressed the previous channel button. His eyes got wide as the announcer was replaced by the erotic moaning. The screen changed from sports to the image of a young woman laying on her back, legs held up by her shoulders as a dildo was thrusted into her by a machine. Her tits, supple and natural, jiggled like jello cups as she took the thick silicone in her little pussy.

""I- I can explain,"" Micheal stuttered, but I hushed him with a gentle finger to his lips.

My finger traced a lip down his chin where I encouraged him to look forward at the screen before I continued to glide my hand down, feeling the soft curls of his chest hair to his abs. I leaned further over the back of the couch to push the pillow aside, revealing that he sat in nothing but a loosely wrapped towel, his cock still semi hard from before I came home.

""She's beautiful,"" I whispered in his ear as I wrapped my hand around the girth of his cock, stroking it up and down to coax it back to its full length. ""Her moans sound so sweet.""

Micheal remained silent, his head resting against my breasts as he watched the girl on the screen continue to get drilled by the dildo.

I quickened my pace, his dick fully erect in my hand, I said, ""she's so wet... I bet it'd feel nice on your cock...""

A quiet moan escaped Micheal's lips, his hips thrusting ever slightly, urging me to stroke faster. But I kept my pace as I slid my hand up my pencil skirt and pulled down my panties in one fluid motion.

""Can you imagine her tight, little pussy sliding on your cock?""

""Yeah..."" he answered quietly.

I slid my fingers into my cunt, it still wet from earlier as I began stroking him faster, matching the pace of the fuck machine in the video. ""You like the way her pussy feels?""

He groaned another response, his cock becoming more engorged. A thick vein pulsed under my fingers and I knew he was getting close.

The girl in the video let out a loud, shuttering moan. Her legs visibly shaking as the silicone cock thrusted faster. Her pussy was a bright pink from the pounding.

""Listen to how your cok makes her cum,"" I said, my voice a barely audible pant as i fucked myself with my fingers. I tightened my fingers on his dick as I continued to stroke. ""You want to cum inside her?""

He didn't say anything for a long moment, but his hips continued to thrust into my hand as my hand glided up and down his shift, lubricated by the pre-cum that beaded on his tip.

""Say it,"" I encouraged him, my fingers thrusting vigorously into my hungry pussy. ""Say that you're going to cum inside her...""

Micheal groaned loudly, his hand grabbing a large fistful of pillow as he obliged. ""I'm gonna cum inside her tight little pussy!""

His cock erupted and my pussy pulsed on my fingers as I climaxed with him. His load shot halfway across the living room from the force of him trying to hold it back, landing on the glass top of the coffee table. It pulsed a few more times releasing more cum until it spilled down over my fingers onto my wedding ring.",,2025-08-15T18:53:31.080574,1935,
https://www.literotica.com/s/queans-of-japan,Queans of Japan,Unknown Author,,,,,"Kairi Yamada was an average woman in the twenty second century. She was a historian and professor, and found herself desperately attracted to one of her students, John Nordica. He had asked for her help after school and she tried her best to act like a teacher of the old world, level headed and clear minded.

He towered over her despite her being ten years his senior. She gulped; just being alone in the room with him was making her feel hot under the collar. Her parents would have been livid at her having such feelings for a what her grandfather would have called, ""a white monkey"", and even she hated herself a bit. But it was not enough to stop her from clearing her throat and sitting across from him.

He was built like a mountain with long golden clouds for hair rolling from the peak of his head down his slopped shoulders. He had an athletes frame. He had a skateboard leaning against the desk and seemed anxious to get this over with and get back to the beach.

""Mr. Nordica."" She addressed him formally. ""You haven't been paying attention in class."" She tried to sound judgmental; she knew she could be quiet, and sometimes quite dry at times. Dry would not be the word to use at the moment however.

""Sorry Doctor Yamada."" He bowed his head politely. ""I can be easily distracted."" She tried not to think that she was the one distracting him. There were prettier women. ""Could you go over the beginning of the chapter again?""

She sighed and opened the textbook. ""The proxy wars of the late twentieth, and early twenty first century extending for over fifty years. Do you remember the major powers?""

""Uh, I think, the USSR?"" He asked sheepishly. She sighed. He was at least trying.

""It fell very early on. The major powers at work were the United States and Russia, with China and to a lesser extent European forces playing a contributing role as well. Do you remember the solution?""

He snapped his fingers, ""Oh, um, the biological weapon!"" She nodded for him to continue. ""Um... It was, uh, Belgium right?""

""France."" She shook her head. ""A viral agent designed not to kill or destroy a population, but to reduce the chances of a male child being born by disrupting the hormonal balance during pregnancy. It was halfway through it's development at the end of the second world war, but never saw use until rediscovered and implemented in the middle east and Africa. Unlike previous wars, these were not fought and won quickly. They lasted decades, so a solution that lowered the fighting population of the next generation was necessary.""

""Do I really need to know this?"" John Nordica asked rolling his eyes. ""Is it really all that important?""

""Did you ever wonder why men are so rare?"" She asked. ""Every year there are fewer male students because of that outbreak. Currently, the ratio is three women to every one man. It is the cause of most modern culture changes in the past one hundred years...""

""Really? I mean, other stuff happened too."" he argued. ""I'm pretty sure AI development was a greater factor to modern culture.""

""I realize you are a science major, but this is very important."" Kairi tried to explain. ""AI development was required because army sizes shrank, and it became more profitable to field machines rather than men due to their rarity. That is what prompted the rise and demand of general intelligence, in turn sparking the second technological revolution in the 2070's""

John scratched his head at that. ""I didn't realize.""

""John, how many mothers do you have?""

""Five.""

""Why do you think that is?""

""Well, they are all happy. I guess they can do whatever makes them that way.""

""Do you realize that marriages of that sort used to be outlawed many years ago in most major countries? They became more and more common as the male population worldwide began to shrink, and now they have become the norm. Most families in developed countries have multiple women involved with the patriarch, even where it is still strictly speaking outlawed or taboo.""

""That makes sense."" He nodded. ""Wait, so does that mean before, it was taboo for a man to be with more than one woman? Seems strange...""

Kairi blushed. ""Well, actually, I come from a small town where it is still considered strange. I've tried opening my mind to it but... well, lets say I'm still a bit backwards.""

""Wow! That's interesting!"" John perked up, like he was looking at a fossil of some ancient civilization. ""So, is that why you aren't married?""

""That is getting a bit personal..."" Kairi coughed, ""Anyway...""

""Have you ever had a boyfriend?"" He asked. Kairi didn't like this conversation.

""I... Where I come from, talking like this to a professor isn't really... well, it's embarrassing at the very least.""

""Really? Most of my other teachers try to come on to me whenever they can."" Kairi tried not to think about that. ""You know Ms. Kim? She's my psychology teacher. I went on a date with her last Saturday. My girlfriend thought it was cute when I showed her pictures. Does that seem strange to you?""

Kairi squirmed in her seat. ""I know Ms. Kim."" She nodded. ""I haven't done anything like that...""

""Wow, you haven't been on a date with a guy before?"" Kairi shook her head. ""...Do you want to?"" Kairi nearly choked on her own saliva.

""N-No... well,"" She looked away. ""I don't want to abuse my position...""

""Come on, it will be fun!"" He smiled. ""It's not like I'm trading it for a grade or anything. I really do want to get better at this stuff. My parents didn't even want me to go to college because I had so many marriage proposals already, but I don't want to be one of those weirdo's who lounges around all day while his girls do everything for him. Makes me feel like my dad."" She still hesitated. ""... You were waiting for someone who wasn't taken weren't you?"" He asked. ""Because it feels weird otherwise?""

""...Yea."" She admitted. ""But I know that is unreasonable this day in age. Just like it used to be unusual to want the lifestyle you find so normal...""

""Don't think of it as a date then. We can just go out as friends, or something."" He shrugged. ""We can meet at a beach bar I like. You in?""

""I..."" It was so sudden. ""... If you ace your next test, maybe."" She shrugged with smile.

He grinned. ""Alright, cool."" He opened his notes and pointed, ""So, tell me again about the financial panic of 2050. The collapse of the international banks...""

-

She couldn't believe it. She was on a date with a guy who probably had dozens of girlfriends. She sighed and finally settled on what to wear. Casual he said, and bring a swimsuit. Gosh, she felt like a teenager again. She wore a light yellow sundress over it. She rarely got to wear it, but her mother always liked it. Probably not the most attractive choice, but she didn't have much else in the form of casual wear.

She decided to walk as the beach was not far away from her house. Along the way she saw the many landmarks that littered the old town, most of them built within the last century. Few understood how powerful each was for their times. One had a man of steel surrounded, and lifted into the air by women made of copper. It symbolized the end of human beings on the front lines in war in the country, and simultaneously women becoming a majority in most STEM fields at the time.

Another was a simple monolith with a chiseled image of a child, a father, and two mothers. It was placed there after the legalization, and subsequent commonality of such unions. Lastly on her path was a Samurai wielding a plow, symbolizing an end of the need for war it's self. World Peace was still a fantasy, as countries without resources still fought each other in the third world, but it was becoming less common as the outbreak continued to effect the least sanitary cultures more than others, and war began to take serious tolls of populations now that men were less expendable.

""Hey!"" She reached the beach and saw John Nordica. He was wearing swimshorts and a smile, his body glistened in the sun and for a moment Kairi wondered why she had ever decided to be shy around him. ""You're here early! I was just coming back from catching some waves."" She walked to him as he dried off. No force on earth could have torn her eyes off of him at that moment. ""Cute dress."" He looked at her body and she suddenly felt completely naked. Her hands clasped each other in front of her crotch and she bowed her head on instinct.

""Thank you!"" She said a bit too loudly.

""Who's this?"" She heard a familiar voice and turned in shock. ""Oh, Kairi!""

A blond, large breasted woman in a string bikini sauntered over. She was halfway between Kairi's height and Johns. Her breasts swayed and bounced hypnotically. ""P-Principal Lisa!"" Kairi bowed her head again. ""What are you doing here?""

""I'm with John."" She shrugged. Kairi gaped. ""No, not like that... Heh, not yet anyways."" She elbowed John Nordica in a playful manner.

""Aunt Lisa..."" John looked away embarrassed. ""Hey, would you entertain Kairi for a bit? I need to make a phone call.""

""Sure thing Sweetie."" She winked as John walked off.

""So, he's your..."" Kairi started.

""Lets get that dress off of you."" She turned, her breasts stealing Kairis attention. ""You are always so tense, I'm glad you decided to finally get some sun.""

""Is, is this really professional..."" She did not resist as the taller woman man handled her.

""A one piece? Really? You need to entice him better then that."" Her blue eyes pierced into Kairi.

""That's not my intent..."" Kairi tried to explain as her boss led her onto the sand. ""...I didn't know you were related to John.""

""Yea, my older sister married his dad. He died a few years ago and now I've ruined my chances with his son. I mean, how weird is that? I look just like his mom! I really do have the worst luck. One of his mothers who isn't blood related has gotten lucky with him though, so maybe there is a chance."" She sat down on a towel beneath an umbrella and urged Kairi to sit down next to her. ""Hey, help me with my back?"" She asked, holding out some tanning oil. Kairi nodded obediently as her boss rolled to her stomach and undid her top. Kairi gulped as she rubbed. ""So if you aren't here for him..."" She smirked. ""You know, I never took you for a lesbian. But maybe you're the submissive type...""

Kairi blushed. ""I, I'm just here because I wanted to try out dating...""

""You've never been on a date before?""

""Well, not with a guy...""

""So you do like girls then?"" her boss smirked. ""You know, that's not as strange as it used to be. I know a lot of women who do it out of desperation...""

""I-I know... That was more when I was a kid.""

""So you've never had sex?""

It was an awkward conversation to have with her boss, but she was already putting oil on her thighs so there was nowhere to go but forward from here, ""Not really no.""

""Damn. You must be horny as hell.""

She dodged the question, ""Do you really want to... 'be' with your nephew?""

""Fuck yea. Beggars can't be choosers and I'm not getting any younger. He's is more of a man than his father was that's for sure.""

""Doesn't it feel... weird?""

""Not as weird as your hands on my ass right now."" Kairi blushed and stopped rubbing. ""Ha, no worries,""

She rolled to her back and Kairi gasped. ""L-Lisa your... your...""

""Hmm? Oh..."" She shrugged, her naked breasts sagging to the sides. ""Looks like you'll need to oil them to huh?""

Kairi looked back and forth along the beach, ""There are people here!""

""Is John watching?"" Kairi did see in the distance John taking glances over during his phone call. ""Come on, keep going. You don't want me to burn do you?""

""R-Right!"" Her hands slipped over her bosses stomach and chest. She tried not to look at Lisa aroused face as she brushed over her tanned skin and pink areolas. She heard murmurs from some passerby and tried to act like what she was doing was normal. When she was done her body shone just like Johns did. ""Lisa, Is this really...""

""Lisa!"" Kairi blushed and looked away as John came back and gave a judgmental glare to his aunt. ""Stop bullying the poor girl. And put your top back on.""

""But it's fun."" She swayed her chest and Kairi found that she was just as entranced as John was.

He broke the spell with a shake of his head and looked to Kairi, ""Hey, sorry for springing this on you, but I actually have to get back home to sort something out. I'm really sorry to bail... actually, if you want, you could have dinner at my place!""

""I'm not dressed for it..."" Kairi tried to argue.

""It's fine, we'll both dress casual.""

Kairi wasn't convinced, but nodded. ""Okay""

""Great! Lets go!""

-

His home was large and fortress like, almost a mansion. She remembered driving past it on the way to work. He informed her that he had turned it into a hotel after his father died, which made sense. Smart business this close to the beach. Upon leaving the Taxi she followed John to the door where a woman in a sleek black pantsuit and silver rimmed glasses awaited. She wore heels so high it made Kairi wince and her eyes were sharp enough to cut when they glared at her. She wielded a clipboard and braced it against her bosom on their approach. Though dressed as a man, her figure was striking enough to still stand out. Her brown hair formed a tight bun.

""Hey, this is my girlfriend Pallas."" He introduced Kairi to the woman. Pallas emanated an aura of judgment. Kairi once again felt completely naked despite being fully clothed. She took a step back anxiously. ""This is my date, Kairi Yamada.""

""It's nice to meet you."" Kairi bowed her head.

""Charmed."" Pallas took no other action and simply stared. She wrote something on her clipboard as she continued, ""John, your cousin has arrived early. I pushed his appointment up because you had a gap in your schedule.""

""Oh man, didn't I tell you? I had a date with Kairi here..."" Pallas's dark amber eyes squinted in mild confusion, as if failing to make out a woman in Kairis visage. ""Any way to fit her in tonight for dinner?""

Pallas checked a sheet on her clipboard. ""Yes, well... Actually you had another appointment there.""

""Who?""

""Well, um, me."" There was a chink in her armor, a weakness in her stern posture and demeanor that showed when she spoke. She held the board more tight against her chest. ""Tonight I was thinking we would go out...""

""Well, you changed my schedule at the last minute. I can't change my plans with Kairi twice in one day, not when I had this planned for some time...""

""Yes, sorry, my mistake. I'll clear some time."" Pallas fidgeted, scribbling out a line and re-writing something else. ""I'll have Nefti serve something nice...""

""What would you like?"" John asked Kairi.

""Um, I'm not a fan of red meat.""

""Fish then. Something Mediterranean?"" He asked. Pallas wrote it down. ""Oh, and, when is my next time off?""

Pallas smiled, ""Um, I think I can re-schedule us for Friday night...""

""Actually, I was planning for someone else..."" John said awkwardly.

""Oh, right, yes of course..."" Pallas was embarrassed but not surprised. ""Then... our date is next Monday?"" It was more of a request than a question.

""Of course."" John bent down and kissed her lightly before turning to Kairi. ""I'm really sorry about this. My cousin and I are thinking of renovating this place to house more guests. You are free to look around, shouldn't take more than a minute. Besides, Pallas loves meeting new people.""

Kairi nodded as he left. Pallas seemed momentarily satiated by the kiss, but it didn't last long. She noticed Kairis presence and bid her follow inside. It was a nice place and she was offered a seat in the entrance hall. ""They keep getting younger."" Pallas murmured, shaking her head. ""So did he pick you up at a middle school somewhere?""

""Actually I'm a tenured professor."" Kairi tried to sound annoyed. ""I teach history at the university.""

""A professor? He's never had one of those before..."" She seemed impressed, but not by her. She noticed that Pallas still had her eyes on her clipboard. ""Have you brought your resume?""

""What?""

""No? What about references? Medical history? Bloodwork? Tax returns...""

""This was going to be a casual thing."" Kairi raised an eyebrow.

""Yes, well, as long as I have anything to say about it my boyfriend won't be paying child support to any lowlifes, or getting any kind of sexually transmitted...""

Kairi looked away, embarrassed, ""N-No I mean, just a date. Not even a romantic one, just, I've never been on one before and he asked me...""

""...He asked you?"" Pallas confirmed.

""Yes?"" Kairi nodded.

""...I think that's the first time he's asked anyone. Generally they come to him. Or I find them."" Kairi could not catch the tone. Happiness? Shame? It was perhaps something in between. ""... Well, I'll run a background check. Could you open your mouth?""

""Hmm?""

Pallas took out a small box from her pocket and removed a sterile looking swab. ""I need a tissue sample from the back of your throat at the very least. Certain haplogroups are more resistant to the epidemic than others, and I'm actively researching in the area.""

""Really? That's very..."" Kairi realized Pallas wasn't interested in talking and decided to submissively open her mouth.

""Any wider?"" Pallas asked.

""Ah Cahnt..."" she felt the soft swab deep in her throat and gagged immediately as Pallas quickly put this instrument back in its place in the box.

""Well, you aren't going down on him that's for sure."" Pallas said casually as Kairi coughed a few more times.

Kairi tried not to imagine it. ""S-So you research Virology?"" Kairi asked hoarsely.

""No. I'm double majoring in Genetics and Forensic Anthropology with minors in Business and Accounting.""

""Wow. And I remember history being tough. Heh..."" Kairi was the only one who laughed.

She heard a beep from the container the swab had been placed in. ""It will take another few hours to fully sequence, but it looks like you are clean of any major genetic illnesses. Congratulations.""

""Wow. Modern technology."" Kairi hadn't realized it was more than just a sterile box.

""Done."" She looked up to see John re-enter the room. ""Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's eat...""

-

The food was wonderful, and Kairi had a good time. Despite the awkward start John Nordica was a very engaging personality.

""You know, this is nice."" John said, off topic. ""I don't often get to talk like this.""

""Like what?""

""Well, most people want something of me. It's all very business like. Even my personal life... especially my personal life actually. But I'm glad I can have dinner like normal person for once.""

""I mostly eat alone."" Kairi smiled. ""This is nice.""

""Well, I guess right now I want to ask... what do you want to do now?"" Kairi struggled to respond. ""It might not look like it, but I think my girlfriend likes you. She generally isn't this nervous around people otherwise. And actually, if you want, you can stay the night and have nothing to do with me. Everyone here likes the company.""

""I..."" She took a deep breath. ""I think, maybe... but it was supposed to be your girlfriends night right? I don't want to impose...""

""She'll live."" John assured her. ""But I want to make sure you are comfortable.""

She nodded. ""Yea. I mean, yes..."" She realized how nervous she looked. ""I'm sorry this is all so sudden. I never thought this would actually escalate...""

""Well, my room is upstairs in the left wing. I have a phone call to make, and after that I'm going to bed. If you are there, you are there. If not, well, I'm sure Pallas can call a taxi for you."" He smiled and got up. ""How does that sound?""

She found herself on his bed, not remembering quite how she got there, waiting in desperation. She couldn't believe this was actually happening. Should she feel proud? Embarrassed? Accomplished? Humiliated? She had dedicated her life to her career for so long and now it all seemed so meaningless. Here she was, waiting for one of her students to make her one of his many relations... and she felt glad?",,2025-08-15T18:53:37.992241,3554,

""Honey, you about read-wow!"" I exclaimed as Barb came out into the kitchen, the vision of her completely chasing my impatience away. Okay, we were still late but she looked stunning! She was wearing a little, red dress that dramatically highlighted her slender form, leaving her shoulders and collarbone bare and only reaching mid-thigh. She even wore heels, red open-toed pumps, raising her maybe five centimeters. I'd never seen the dress or shoes before, they had to be new.

Her make-up was also more pronounced that usual. A bit more mascara and eye-shadow and blood-red lip that really drew my attention, and matched her dress well.

""You like?"" she smiled, her teeth white against her red lips.

""I... yeah! But... aren't you a little... ehh...""

""I want to dress up a little, is that a problem?"" she asked in a voice that had quickly turned challenging.

""Of course not, honey,"" I quickly agreed, reading the room quite clearly, ""you look beautiful.""

""Thank you,"" she said with a mollified smile. I was just wearing a shirt and jeans, my usual uniform when going to our parties - I almost wished I'd known she'd dress up, I could have worn a suit.

Kneeling down to tie my black sued shoes, I looked up at Barb who had a strange expression on her face.

""What?"" I asked as I stood back up.

""Nothing, nothing,"" she said quickly. Way too quickly. Something was definitely up, and it wasn't all that difficult to figure out what was on her mind. Helen. Barbara hadn't seen her since the night when she and I shared that first kiss in Lisa-Ann and Tim's kitchen.

""Not nothing,"" I replied, ""what's the matter? Helen?""

""Why would

she

be the matter? Why would I care about

her

?"" she all but spat at me and we both looked a little shocked at her outburst. Was my wife losing it?

""I..."" I began, not really knowing what I was going to say. Helen had not really been mentioned outside the bedroom, so I had no idea how to navigate this conversation.

""Are you gonna be with me at all tonight? Or does she need all your attention?"" she said, in a cold voice, completely contradicting what she'd

just

said.

""Eh, look, Barb,"" I tried, caught off guard. Her face fell and she herself looked shocked at her own words.

""I'm sorry,"" she said quickly, ""I didn't mean it like that. It's just... Okay, yeah, I am thinking about her."" She looked down.

""Look,"" I began, ""I'm sorry if-""

""No, I'm sorry,"" she interrupted me again, ""that was... uncalled for.""

""Barb,"" I said in a serious voice and waited until she looked up into my eyes, ""do you want me to... to end things with Helen?""

""Would you?"" she asked in a small, vulnerable voice.

""Of course,"" I told her and drew her into a hug, ""you're my wife, and I love you. That's all that matters."" But even as my arms embraced her, I realised that I didn't

want

to end things with Helen. I

really

didn't. What the hell was going on with me?

""No,"" she said after a little while, ""no. I'm just silly.""

""You sure?"" I asked, catching her eyes again.

""Yeah,"" she said with a smile, ""yeah, I am. It's so... I dunno, exciting. Emotional. I get jealous sometimes. But then... the sex... and it's such a... a rush. I can't really describe it.""

""Yeah, I understand,"" I agreed, trying to show compassion while hiding the relief I felt.

""And you... deserve the best. You're the best husband I could ever have, and you deserve a sexy girlfriend,"" she said.

""And a sexy wife,"" I grinned at her, trying to lighten the mood. She gave me a half-smile that seemed to say 'you have to say that but we both know it's not true.'

""Let's go,"" she murmured, ending all further discussion. Probably for the best, so off we went. This month's hosts were Greg and Marianne who lived about a five minutes walk from us - though had I known Barb would be dressed to the nines, we might have taken the car - especially since she walked a little unsteadily in her heels. But then I'd have had to stay sober to drive. Still, it felt a little unnerving to escort such a beautifully dressed woman down our usual street. Maybe because I felt under-dressed?

""So ehm..."" she said after we'd walked a few minutes down the street, interrupting my musings ""I'd like you to... if you could... if you get a chance to, eh...""

""Yeah?"" I wondered.

""I'd like you to hook up with her tonight. At the party,"" she said and swallowed while looking at me out of the corner of her eye and chewing on her lower-lip.

""What?"" I exclaimed and stopped to look at her.

""While they're all there. I'd like you to... with Helen,"" she repeated.

""You just complained she steals all my attention, and now you want...?"" I asked.

""I said I was sorry! Just... forget about that. It was... it was nothing,"" she assured me, finally meeting my eyes head-on, ""I'd really like if you could...""

""Barb, really? You want us to sneak up into Greg and Marianne's bedroom or something?"" I wondered, disbelief clear in my voice.

""Or... maybe their basement? Or... or garden, once... everyone's good and drunk, maybe?"" she suggested.

""Honey, we're gonna get caught. Someone's bound to notice..."" I pointed out, ""especially since... well, Helen's not exactly quiet, you know.""

Her eyes lit up at that little tidbit and I could almost feel her excitement.

""Barb, I'm not fucking Helen at the party, okay?"" I said slowly and deliberately. Christ, I couldn't believe I even had to say that. Weird that I had to specify that I wouldn't do it

at the party

. For most men, the line would have been 'I'm not fucking Helen' but me, I had to be more precise.

""Okay, okay,"" she said, ""but then... maybe... maybe... something else?"" She looked hopefully at me.

""Like?""

""Like... you know... I'll bet she'd love to eh..."" she lowered her voice, ""blow you. You could quietly slip away and... and have fun...""

What the hell do you say to that? It was crazy. We'd get caught. And for what? We could just do it at Helen's place again, why did we have to involve our friends?

""Honey,"" I tried, ""why-?""

""Pleaaaase, James,"" she interrupted me, ""it's not such a great sacrifice, is it? To... to have some... fun with Helen?""

She did have a point there.

""Well,"" I sighed, ""maybe..."" I really had no backbone when it came to women, did I?

She looked at me, then a slow, sexy smile appeared on her lips.

""Thanks, dear,"" she breathed and gave me a hug and took my hand as we continued on our way and soon made it to our destination.

""You know, if we just talked to Helen about all this, I'm sure we could-"" I tried again.

""

No

, James,"" she cut me off.

""James, hey!"" Marianne greeted me with an immediate hug when she opened the door, before turning to my wife, ""and Barb! Wow, girl, you look...!"" She moved as if to hug her but instead stopped and studied her outfit.

""Oh this?"" Barb smiled with obviously fake modesty and smoothed an imaginary crease on her thigh, ""well, I got a new dress and... wanted to show it off.""

""You too? I wish I'd gotten the memo,"" Marianne replied in a dry voice. She herself was wearing a pale green, knee-length dress. Nothing ugly or anything but pretty plain compared to Barb's sexy little number.

""Too?"" Barb wondered and looked at our host with questioning eyes.

""You'll see,"" she answered cryptically.

Barb and I looked at each other, shrugged and went inside. It seemed we were amongst the first to arrive, so we went straight to the living-room where we saw what Marianne had meant. In the middle of the room stood Greg and talked to a

very

attractive,

very

curvy blonde in a little black dress.

Greg turned to us with an enthusiastic ""James! Barb!"" and he and I shook hands before Barb gave him a hug. Helen in the meantime moved up and gave me the sauciest, little smile. I tried to keep my eyes on hers, to save a little face while my wife was in the room but I couldn't resist a quick look down her superb body. Her big boobs

really

filled out that dress and showed off a cleavage a man could get lost in. The thin, black fabric clung to her like a second layer of skin and showed us the shape of her lovely thighs before ending well above the knees.

Her make-up matched her dress: black eye-shadow, dark-red lipstick and long, fake black eye-lashes, and her nails were painted black too. Her long, blonde hair hung down her shoulders in silky-soft curls and around her neck was a black satin choker with a circular pattern of rhinestones

She was sexy as hell and, like Barb, way over-dressed for these little get-togethers.

My wandering eyes had not gone unnoticed and her smile turned wider, more self-assured. She had effortlessly captured me while my wife was just behind me. Honestly, Helen was vamped up in a way that made Barb even in her beautiful dress and artful make-up look boring, and they both knew it.

""Hello James,"" she all but purred and hugged me, and not the chaste hug friends do - especially when one friend's wife was right next to them. Instead, she pressed herself against me, pushing her soft, giant tits against my chest and even rubbed her crotch against mine.

""He-hey Helen,"" I croaked, my throat dry. She looked up at me and licked her lips, and I almost forgot about everyone else and kissed her. She seemed to know because she gave me a knowing smile, before she let go and turned to my wife who had finished hugging Greg.

""And Barbara,"" my lover smiled though she had lost some of her warmth.

""Helen,"" my wife replied, her lips a thin line, before she forced an unconvincing smile on them that disappeared in seconds. They gave each other a quick, performative hug.

""So good to see you,"" Helen said, ""and what a beautiful dress."" The words were perfectly fine but there was a definite condescending undertone.

""Thank you, it's new,"" Barb answered with a new, fake smile, ""and you too. Though perhaps,"" she added with a pointed look down Helen's cleavage that was so clearly on display, ""we didn't expect to see quite so

much

of you...""

Helen's beautiful smile turned ugly for a second. She leaned in and said something in a low tone to Barb that I couldn't hear. Barb made a face but didn't answer, and I was suddenly worried a cat-fight would break out right here and now.

Greg and I gave each other an uncomfortable look. He, of course, had no idea what was going on between the women, whereas I was just hoping this train-wreck of a meet-up would be over soon.

""Now,"" I said loudly before Barb could find a snide reply to whatever Helen had said and moved in between them, ""why don't we go and find ourselves a glass of wine."" I hooked my arm around Barb's and pulled her with me.

""Yeah,"" she agreed.

""Good idea, James,"" Helen said and slid her arm around my free one, clearly inviting herself along. I looked at her in surprise but then shrugged (better not to make a scene) and escorted my two ladies to the table where an open bottle of red and some glasses stood.

""Greg!"" Marianne called from the kitchen, and he quickly exited the awkward situation while I poured us each a glass of wine, and toasted my two women who pointedly ignored each other. Barb quickly drained most of her glass in one, angry gulp and held it out for a refill while Helen gave her a mocking look.

""So, eh... Helen,"" I said while filling my wife's glass, ""what have you been up to?""

As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I froze and gave Barb a quick, guilty look. After all, I knew exactly what Helen had been up to...

me

.

""Oh you know,"" she shrugged but gave me a smoldering look - a look I had seen before, most memorable when her lips where wrapped around my iron-hard cock - ""I keep myself busy...""

Her low, sensual voice made my dick strain against my boxers... and made Barb empty her second glass.

""You thinking of dancing tonight, Barbara?"" Helen asked my wife in a seemingly innocent voice.

""I... don't know,"" Barb answered, ""why?""

""Well, just that you married the best dancer in the group,"" she said smiling at me, ""so if you don't take him out, you can't expect the rest of us to stay away. You don't mind, do you?""

""I ehh..."" Barb was trying hard to focus now, it seemed, ""Of... of course not.""

Thanks to her slender form and eh... smallish breasts, Barb rarely wore a bra. I was starting to wonder if she shouldn't have worn one tonight though, as her nipples were suddenly poking through her thin dress. She might be hissing at Helen like an angry cat but she didn't seem to mind her and me dancing. I didn't get it but then, I didn't have to.

""What do you say, James? Wanna have some... fun?"" she smiled and swayed her hips in an inviting way.

""With you? Of course!"" I grinned, and all three of us understood what I meant - though of course, Helen didn't know that Barbara knew.

The rest of our friend-group gradually arrived; Tim and Lisa-Ann, Richard and Isabelle and Eric and Sophia. And when next we saw Marianne, she had changed from her boring, ordinary dress to a hot little number, grey, tight and

very

short. Apparently, she had summoned Greg to watch the food and greet the guests while she changed so as to not be undone by my ladies. The unwritten rule about not outshining the hostess would not be broken on Marianne's watch!

She was actually very attractive, and the new dress was way more flattering for her impeccably smooth legs and tight butt. I made sure to compliment her on it, and she surely seemed to like the attention.

I noticed Lisa-Ann and Sophia didn't seem to care too much for this new trend. Sophia made a dry remark that she wished she'd been informed of the new dress-code as she certainly had some nice dresses she wouldn't mind showing off.

Neither Helen nor Marianne seemed to care, though Barb did duck her head when she heard Sophia's remark. It seemed that the next party was gonna be interesting...

Dinner started off a bit subdued but some alcohol and friendly jibes later, and all was well. I was seated next to Barb and across from Helen, so I had rich opportunity to entertain myself with my two women, so beautifully dressed. Only, Barb was not much fun. Maybe her gambit with dressing up, only to still be outdone by Helen and her magnificent body had taken the wind out of her sails. At any rate, she was pretty subdued, drinking more than speaking.

Oh well, I still had Helen, and she was always great fun - whether she was telling silly stories from her school or not-so-subtly stroking the stilk of her wine-glass up and down in a very suggestive manner while looking directly at me with that inviting smile she had. Between that and the way her cleavage kept flirting with me all through dinner, I really needed to get her alone. Maybe Barb hadn't been so crazy after all.

Maybe we could sneak up in Greg and Marianne's bedroom?

No, that would be mad. But I needed her so bad!

""Greg, dear, I think we're done eating,"" Marianne said finally and turned to her husband.

""Oh. Yeah,"" he nodded and it didn't take long for the food to be taken away.

""I'll just put the left-overs away if you strong men could move the table?"" she said.

""Yeah, sure,"" we agreed, and we did so, creating a sizeable dance-floor.

""You remember you promised me the first dance?"" Helen said as she came up to me and possessively slid an arm around my waist. Barb didn't say a word, just retreated back to the couch in the corner of the room, her hard nipples pointing the way.

""Sure, sure,"" I said, not really liking how brazen she was. After all, we really didn't want the rest of the gang to know we were fucking. And wasn't she supposed to hide it from Barb too? Since, to her mind, I was being unfaithful on the down-low.

Maybe she was as hot for me, as I was for her. And maybe she wasn't entirely sober either.

""Sure, we just need some music. Greggie?"" I asked our host.

""Don't call me that... Jimmy,"" he grinned as he made his way to the loudspeakers, where a tablet was already set up. I made a face - I'd always hated being called Jimmy - and dragged Helen away from the others, giving us space to dance.

The music started and more couples moved out on the dance-floor, starting to dance.

""You look so hot!"" I told Helen into her ear covered by the music, while I began to find my rhythm. That sexy, self-assured smile appeared on her face, and she bit her lower-lip in a flirty way.

""You think so?"" she asked.

""Hell yeah!"" I took half a step back and gave her the old elevator-look, lingering a bit on her exposed cleavage before stepping back up to her, ""that dress is crazy-sexy on you!""

""I wore it for you,"" she told me in a husky voice, ""since you haven't been over in almost a week, I wanted to remind you what you were missing..."" She gave me a cheeky smile but there was something serious in the way she said it.

She

did

understand that I was married, right? If we needed to uphold the illusion that I was cheating on Barb - which Barb insisted on - then I couldn't very well leave my wife alone every night.

Did Helen suspect that Barb was in on it? No... why would she think that? Had we been to open about it? Christ, there were too many layers in this relationship, and I was

not

smart enough to keep all these balls in the air at the same time. Sooner or later, they were coming crashing down... and almost certainly on

my

balls.

I gave a sorta half-shrug as reply, and we continued the dance.

For the next couple of hours, we flirted, danced and had fun. I couldn't focus just on Helen, though. It would have been too obvious. I failed to convince Barbara to shake her legs, but I danced with Marianne, complementing her on her dress and having some fun with her. She was a good dancer and quite sexy, especially in that new dress.

However, I did

not

like when Greg danced with Helen. To avoid misunderstandings, I was glad that she was getting accepted as one of us again, but I hated seeing her have fun with that oaf Greg. He was a horrible dancer! And gimme-a-break, he kept bumping into her chest, like that was not on purpose. For Christ' sake, he just stepped on her toes! I could see how she suppressed a grimace of pain and managed to smile when he apologised.

I caught her eyes over Marianne's shoulder and rolled my eyes at Greg. She winked at me, and they continued the dance.

""Something going on with Helen?"" my dance-partner asked. She had to go up on toes to say it into my ear to be heard over the music.

""Huh?"" I quickly turned my attention to her.

""You seem to look at her more than me,"" she pointed out, a little tersely.

""Oh. Oh. Eh... No. No, I just enjoy watching Greg step on people's toes,"" I laughed.

She joined the laugh, probably happy it wasn't her feet that was being attacked this time.

""He tries so hard!"" she mock-defended her husband with a giggle.

""Yeah,"" he I said, ""though he'll never be able to do this."" In time to the beat, I stepped up to her, grabbed her around the waist and lifted her up on my hip while leaning away from her.

""Ooh!"" she gasped as she was partly lifted from the ground and grabbed me around the neck, ""James!"" I used the momentum to pirouette us around before setting her down on the floor again. It was a fairly simple lift but compared to Greg, it was light-years ahead.

She laughed and gave me a quick kiss on the cheek before letting go of me.

Some of our friends laughed and clapped and we grinned back and gave little bows. Barb stared intensely at me, and Helen didn't seem to find it impressive that I swung another woman around. Oh well.

Marianne and I found the rhythm again and danced more subdued for a little while.

""Wanna try again?"" I grinned once I felt she had had enough recovery, and she nodded eagerly. I'd done this with Barb a few times when we took dance-classes but she was too stiff to do it properly, and I hadn't tried with anyone else, since I hadn't wanted to get too grabby-feely with any other woman.",,2025-08-15T18:53:44.694137,3641,
https://www.literotica.com/s/sex-worker-corps-02-breaking-in,Sex Worker Corps 02: Breaking In,Unknown Author,,,,,"When I arrived at my domicile, I was surprised but what I found. It was a studio apartment, with a massive closet, outfits already stocked for my client's pleasure, with my sizes, and a great bathroom made for fun and function.

I was missing Gemma, my bunk mate from basic training, and knew that by lunch time, I would meet my first male sexual partner, who would be sticking around until Friday afternoon.

I found a full suite of soaps and shampoos for me and clients, lubricants, healing lotions.

I was wearing my sundress from my interview to join the corp, and decided before he came, I would pick out my outfit. I had practiced a lot of things over the last 6 weeks, but none of it had been with a man, and I was nervous.

I found a matching pair of red satin panties, and bra, and a dress that matched well, with strappy heels. Once I was dressed, my hair done and my make up perfect, I looked in the mirror proudly. I was sexy, and I knew I had excelled compared to my fellow basic trainees. I told myself I would do well.

There was a buzz from the intercom. I buzzed in my mystery man, and my stomach fluttered. When he knocked on my door, I checked myself in the mirror before opening it.

When I opened it, there was a man about 35, with handsome brown eyes, and a sweet smile. He was a little doughy, but not fat, and he held flowers.

""Um... Hi, Hadley?""

I nodded, and he handed me the flowers. ""I'm Hank. It's nice to meet you.""

I took the flowers, and hugged him, saying ""nice to meet you too"" into his ear.

Then we closed the door behind him.

""You have a nice domicile,"" he said.

""Thank you, have you been in many? Is this standard?""

He blushed, ""I've been in some, but never on move-in day. So, this is a little nicer.""

""Can I get you something to drink? Or eat?"" I ask. Hosting and being a companion were equally important in our basic training.

""I'd be down for a glass of wine if you'll join me? Put us both at ease?""

I find a bottle of chilled white and pour us each a glass.

""To a beautiful young woman!"" he said holding his glass up.

""To 'breaking me in!'"" This was the term the corps used was our 'break in period.'

We sipped our wine, and he said, ""did they give you a check list?""

I nodded, and pulled it up on my phone.

""Is there any particular place you want to start?"" He asked.

I scrolled through the list:

-making out

-blowjob with swallow

-facial cumshot

-rimjob

-foot worship

-vaginal intercourse with creampie

-anal intercourse

-ass to mouth

-golden shower

-urine drinking

""I think I want to start simpler, and work my way up. If that's ok with you?""

""That sounds good. I'm just happy to be here, and while I'm ok with everything on the list, my tastes are pretty vanilla.""

We looked at each other for a couple minutes, his eyes looking into mine, or down at my lips, but never further south. Finally, I leaned in and kissed him.

He was minty fresh, which was one thing I didnt expect after six week of kissing fellow ass-eaters. We all brushed regularly, but there was a lot of less than fresh kissing.

His hands moved to my waist, as we kissed, and he never explored my body. His tongue only entered my mouth after I had entered his.

When we broke our kiss, he said, ""I'm happy to return the favor on all of those, well the ones I can...""

He had a cute bashfulness about him, and I wondered if all the guys picked to break sex workers in were as gentle. I hoped Gemma's was.

""I think maybe we could continue this, without clothes?"" I asked knowing I'd need to keep things moving forward.

He nodded, and began undressing, facing away to allow me privacy. I wasn't sure he turned me on, but he made me feel safe and comfortable.

Once we were both naked, we sat on my king sized bed, and made out again.

""You can touch me..."" I said between kisses, and one of his hands moved to my thigh, the other held my back.

His cock was already hard, with a tuft of hair, so I reached down and started touching gently, and finally wrapping my hand around it.

He must have felt bolder because of this, ad he move his hand from my thigh to my breast and started gently squeezing. I moaned into his kiss.

""Maybe we could start with a blowjob? I practiced alot on dildos during basic training. I think it might be good...""

""Yes, that sounds great."" He kissed me again, and then I slid off of the bed and knelt before him on the floor.

His balls were massive, much bigger than I had seen in sex ed, or even on the dildos. He must have seen the look on my face, and bashfully turned red.

""For breaking in, they give us a hormone that makes our loads bigger, so when you swallow it will be more than a normal client. So they don't seem so bad...""

My jaw dropped, but then I looked up and asked ""does it hurt?""

""Not really, it aches, and I've been told cumming will be a massive relief.""

""Good, I'll make it better."" I already wanted to make him feel better, he was too sweet to suffer.

I craned my neck and kissed the tip gently, and started slowly and sensually sucking on it, making sure to keep my mouth wet, my tongue gliding under the glans.

His cock smelled of soap, and tasted clean. I was grateful for that. As I got it wetter, I would push down further. I had deepthroated cocks thicker and longer, but I had also been taught that it was bad for his ego to effortlessly deepthroat him.

""Hadley, oh fuck. You're amazing!""

One hand was on the back of my head, the other held my hand on his knee. My free hand alternated between stroking and cradling his giant balls.

When I had worked up to deepthroating him, my nose would touch his pubic hair, and press through to his flesh, and I would slide my tongue out as far as I could to lick his balls.

""Oh baby,"" his grunting was signaling that he was getting close.

I pulled up off his cock, ""you have to record it for my file."" Then I dove down on his cock again. I heard his camera's phone start recording.

""Oh fuck, baby..."" he said and I backed up to start working the head sensuously.

I looked into his camera, as the first shot filled my mouth. I closed my eyes and started to swallow as fast as I could, but there was too much. My cheeks puffed out, and I kept chugging. I gagged, mid swallow on my third chug, my mouth filled to the brim with more coming, and a stream shot out of my nostrils.

After a minute of him cumming and me gagging and swallowing and coughing, I gulped the last bit down, some on my top lip frm my nose, and I opened wide for the camera, showing I had successfully down it all.

My eyes were watering, and I gasped for breath, and I said to him while he was still recording, ""do I need to swallow this too?"" and pointed to the bit that shot out of my nose.

""I don't think so. You showed you can swallow!""

He stopped recording and fell back on the bed.

I went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth and washed up.

When I came back out, he was snoring softly. I looked and saw that his balls were significantly smaller, although still bigger than I would have expected.

I got a glass of water and sat on the couch, and picked up one of my school books. I had a week until classes began, my college would be completely free as part of my service, and I intended to make the most of it. The book was for my American History class, starting in 2097 when both North and South America became a unified nation.

I read for more than an hour when Hank woke up.

""Sorry, they did warn that the orgasms while on this semen enhancer might cause me to have extreme fatigue."" He got himself a glass of water and joined me on the couch. He pulled my feet into his lap and began rubbing.

""That's ok. I just figured I'd get a head start on school. You looked very cute sleeping.""

He blushed. ""That was the best blowjob I've ever had... You did amazing.""

I smiled and put my book down. ""Can I ask you about your experiences as a man? Like... Do you visit the brothels a lot? Do you have a pretty good amount of blowjobs received?"" I genuinely wanted to know, the men in my life before joining could never talk about their brothel experiences with me, due to our relationships.

""I'm retired military, working at Channel 5 news, so I earn 2 credits a day."" Everyone in society citizen or not, criminal or not, got at least 1 brothel credit a day. A credit equaled one hour at a brothel.

""I visit three different sex workers regularly, spending a few hours a week with each. My brothel experiences are sexual, but also I am emotionally connected to them. Thats kind of how they pick men for this program. They don't want a guy to show up, have sex and never see you again, in case you form an emotional connection with your first.""

""I knew that they picked guys to be more emotionally available, didn't know how they determined that. Are your other three, are they connected to you as well?""

He shrugged. ""You only know, if you ask them to be more when they get out of the corps, or in our case, if when this week is done, you're connected to me, you can turn off or on my access for dates. Sex workers only have that option on their break in partner. Or if a man assaults them.""

""I assume that you haven't been to rape row?""

He blushed again. ""Not as a client, as a cameraman with the news. Rape row clients aren't allowed to be break in partners.""

His tone was quiet, and I could tell he didn't want to talk about it.

""What is your kink? The thing you like most about being with a sex worker?"" I asked changing the subject.

""Um... when you spend time with a sex worker, don't show up, get off and leave, you get to see them at ease, and comfortable. They become familiar with you, and they give off a sense of emotional coziness. I assume they know I'll be well groomed, kind, giving, and so hopefully I get to be somewhat a break from other men. But some women, they haven't given off that same feeling, and so I don't return. I want to be somewhere where I'm making the experience better.""

""Your cock was very clean, your breath fresh. I think you're doing a good job.""

He blushed, and his cock twitched under my sole. He really liked being accommodating, and I liked it about him.

""When you're ready, maybe we could work on another check list item?""

He smiled. ""I'm not hard yet, but--""

I interrupted and said ""Maybe one of the things you don't need to be hard for? Maybe they'll get you there?""

He nodded, and I pulled out my phone with the list.

""Um... so I very thoroughly washed, and so maybe we start with a rimjob? Get it out of the way?""

I nodded.

""Then golden shower and piss drinking? Get all of that out of the way?""

He nodded, and took a big gulp of water.

I slid onto the floor in front of him on the couch, handing him my phone to record with, and he pulled his legs up to give me access.

His ass was a little hair, but clean and fresh, and as I had so many times in the previous six weeks, I pushed my face in and started licking.

His balls were resting on my eyebrows, as I tongue fucked his ass like a professional. I heard the video start, and smiled at it while catching my breath and dove back in.

Eventually, he stopped me and said panting I emerged from under his balls.

""You did a really good job cleaning.""

His cock was hard, and I knew our chance at watersports was temporarily on hold.

""I can go brush my teeth, and maybe we can try having regular sex?"" I said and he grabbed my wrist and pulled me in for a kiss.

""If my ass is so clean you don't have to brush on my account."" He smiled kindly, and I started kissing him, and crawled up into his lap straddling.

His cock was resting on my belly, my pussy already wet. I kissed him, and then looked at him and smiled.

""I have had a lot of fun getting off with my basic training squad, but I'm ultimately a straight girl, wanting to get fucked properly... And I'm glad it's going to be you.""

We kissed and I lifted myself and pushed his cock under me, until I felt the tip pressing against my pussy. I closed my eyes, and held my breath as I slowly sank onto it, and it entered me.

There was a bit of tension, and it hurt as I pressed past it, then it was ok. When I was all the way down, and he was as deep inside me as he could get, I sat and kissed him, and he wiped away a couple of tears I hadn't realized I had shed.

""You're so beautiful..."" he told me, and I kissed him again.

I started to slowly rise and fall on his cock, adjusting the arch in my back to find where it felt the best. His thumb started rubbing my clit and I tilted back a but, so the head of his cock was rubbing my front vaginal wall, and he began sucking on my tits as he continued to rub.

In the six weeks of basic training one of our workouts had been stamina training for all different types of cowgirl, but without the benefit of a cock inside us. I was feeling up for riding him as long as necessary. Turned out it took a while, despite how good it felt pretty quickly, but eventually, my riding and his rubbing and sucking had me cumming hard.

After I came, it only took a couple more pumps before he filled my hot wet pussy with his second massive load.

We kissed, and didn't move for a couple minutes, before I finally climbed off of him, and he went grabbed me some tissue so I didnt drip all the way to the bathroom. There was a reddish color on his cock.

He got in the shower, and a minute later I joined him. Putting my phone on the counter. We kissed and I washed his cock thoroughly.

""Do you have to pee?"" I asked him.

He nodded, and I turned off the shower, reached for my phone, handed it to him and knelt.

I didn't want to be peed on, or to drink it, but I understood many clients would be wanting this, and I needed to do my duty.

I smiled up at him, he started the camera, and he started peeing. My chest tightened, and I tried not to blush, but I felt so dirty.

After what felt like a lot of pee, he stopped, and said ""you want to check both boxes right now?""

I nodded and opened wide. He started peeing right into my mouth. It was hot and had an odd taste, not as bad as I worried but not good. I gulped and opened four times, and suddenly my belly felt really heavy from cum and piss.

I smiled and said ""Thank you baby"" to the camera, when he was done.

He washed up, and got out allowing me to wash myself thoroughly. I gargled water and brushed my teeth again. I burped and tasted a mix of cum and piss. I felt gross, but proud.

Once I was clean, and dry, I joined him on the couch again. I sent off my first few proof of achievement videos to Mistress Mandy, and then sent them to Gemma.

""Sorry, about the pee. It's not really my thing.""

My legs were drapped over his lap, and I laid back.

""I really like you..."" I said. He was like a father figure, but I saw him as a sexual being.

""I really like you too.""

There was a comfortable quiet for minutes, then I broke it.

""You work as a cameraman on the news?""

He nodded.

""Which show?""

""The Evening News with Angela Mercado."" He perked up saying her name, and I did too.

""Oh my god, we watched that show every night at my home. My mom thinks my dad visited Angela Mercado when she was in the SWC. He just loves her.""

Hank smiled. ""She's amazing. I was already working there when she came out of the corps, and started as a field reporter. I was the caneraman on her famous rape row segment that landed her the anchor job.""

""I haven't seen it. I went into basic training on my 18th birthday, so I havent got to see any of those reports. My parents would send us to bed and watch the 'state of the corps' specials without us.""

""Can I show you a state of the corps special that Angela and I shot that I'm most proud of?""

I nodded, and sat up excitedly. He turned on the TV and started to search until he found a 9 minute segment called ""Bukkake Benefits,"" and clicked it.

Angela was probably 28 in the video, she had retired from the corps at 25 to go into journalism, it was a shorter program, but required at least three 6 week tours of rape row. Journalists were a special breed.

Angela was brunette, and wearing a pretty but non-seductive business dress, and standing outside of a brothel building, most looked the same--high rise 22nd century.

""I'm here today at the Minneapolis Brothel District. Minneapolis's Brothel District is home to one Corps member, who has made quite a name for herself, Dina Farrell.""

The camera cut to Angela talking in a domicile almost identical to Dina, a naked blonde, with perfect teeth and oversized blue eyes, and pink nipples.

""Look at you Angie, on the nightly news!"" She said excitedly.

""Dina and I were bunkmates in basic training in Alexandria. Before she came up here to help with an understaffed brothel district.""

Dina smiled and said, ""That's actually how I came to find I was good at servicing multiple men. I volunteered for a train session, to help with backlog.""

While she spoke it cut to a clip of her being filled airtight by black cocks. She was smiling and looked so lustful. I began touching myself as she worked them.

""The girls in my building call me 'the Gangbang Queen'.""

They cut back to Angela and Dina on the couch. Angela spoke directly to camera.

""In the nine years since joining the Sex Worker Corps, Dina has serviced nine hundred, nintety-nine thousand, nine hundred and thirty seven individual cocks. At 27 years old, she is poised to beat the previous million cock record by two and a half years. We're going to be with her over the next twenty four hours, while she works through her remaining 63 cocks.""

The rest of the segment showed her sucking and fucking and at the end, with only a few cocks remaining, all the men who had been there for the day, came on her face and tits. The segment ended with a big smile gooey smile and her blowing a kiss, with her eyes covered completely.

""Wow,"" I said to Hank as it ended.

He nodded. ""She's still going. It's been seven years since that segment, and apparently she's topped 2 million, they had to move her to a new city every year to keep her numbers up. She's working in being the first woman to 5 million. I think she's in Mexico City.""

I was in awe.

""She's become the biggest recruiting tool. Someone who just loves the corps, and doesn't seem to have an ambition outside the corps.""

I nodded. ""Did you fuck her?""

He blushed and nodded.

""It's nothing to be embarrassed about. She's beautiful, and clearly very happy to serve.""

We sat quietly until my phone dinged, and I had a video from Gemma. I slide closer to Hank, and he put his arm around me, and we watched her get fucked in the ass, suck the cock and take a thick facial. Her patrner's balls were as big as Hank's and her face looked like several men had cum on her. She grinned and licked some into her mouth.

Hank's cock stirred a little at the sight. I grinned at him.

""You think she's hot? She was my bunkmate...""

""She's really hot. But, you're better.""

We kissed a little, and my phone alarm went off, letting me know it was work out time. I went to ignore it, and he asked what it was. He volunteered to go down to the gym with me. I put in my workout bra, and some socks and sneakers, and he put on boxer briefs that kept him from bouncing, socks and sneakers, and we went to the gym on the top floor of the building.

There were a lot of glistening women naked except for heavy sports bras and sneakers. I saw why Hank was open to coming with me.

""You wanted to workout?"" I whispered to him with a giggle.

""Yes, I've been around naked women a lot, this isn't nearly as special as having a week with a beautiful young cadet,"" he said sincerely.

""I heard back in the day, when the corps started they called us cunt cadets, but as the stigma around sex work wore off and the greater good was seen, the name faded... You ever use that term?""

My eyes were watering, and I gasped for breath, and I said to him while he was still recording, ""do I need to swallow this too?"" and pointed to the bit that shot out of my nose.

""I don't think so. You showed you can swallow!""

He stopped recording and fell back on the bed.

I went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth and washed up.

When I came back out, he was snoring softly. I looked and saw that his balls were significantly smaller, although still bigger than I would have expected.

I got a glass of water and sat on the couch, and picked up one of my school books. I had a week until classes began, my college would be completely free as part of my service, and I intended to make the most of it. The book was for my American History class, starting in 2097 when both North and South America became a unified nation.

I read for more than an hour when Hank woke up.

""Sorry, they did warn that the orgasms while on this semen enhancer might cause me to have extreme fatigue."" He got himself a glass of water and joined me on the couch. He pulled my feet into his lap and began rubbing.

""That's ok. I just figured I'd get a head start on school. You looked very cute sleeping.""

He blushed. ""That was the best blowjob I've ever had... You did amazing.""

I smiled and put my book down. ""Can I ask you about your experiences as a man? Like... Do you visit the brothels a lot? Do you have a pretty good amount of blowjobs received?"" I genuinely wanted to know, the men in my life before joining could never talk about their brothel experiences with me, due to our relationships.

""I'm retired military, working at Channel 5 news, so I earn 2 credits a day."" Everyone in society citizen or not, criminal or not, got at least 1 brothel credit a day. A credit equaled one hour at a brothel.

""I visit three different sex workers regularly, spending a few hours a week with each. My brothel experiences are sexual, but also I am emotionally connected to them. Thats kind of how they pick men for this program. They don't want a guy to show up, have sex and never see you again, in case you form an emotional connection with your first.""

""I knew that they picked guys to be more emotionally available, didn't know how they determined that. Are your other three, are they connected to you as well?""

He shrugged. ""You only know, if you ask them to be more when they get out of the corps, or in our case, if when this week is done, you're connected to me, you can turn off or on my access for dates. Sex workers only have that option on their break in partner. Or if a man assaults them.""

""I assume that you haven't been to rape row?""

He blushed again. ""Not as a client, as a cameraman with the news. Rape row clients aren't allowed to be break in partners.""

His tone was quiet, and I could tell he didn't want to talk about it.

""What is your kink? The thing you like most about being with a sex worker?"" I asked changing the subject.

""Um... when you spend time with a sex worker, don't show up, get off and leave, you get to see them at ease, and comfortable. They become familiar with you, and they give off a sense of emotional coziness. I assume they know I'll be well groomed, kind, giving, and so hopefully I get to be somewhat a break from other men. But some women, they haven't given off that same feeling, and so I don't return. I want to be somewhere where I'm making the experience better.""

""Your cock was very clean, your breath fresh. I think you're doing a good job.""

He blushed, and his cock twitched under my sole. He really liked being accommodating, and I liked it about him.

""When you're ready, maybe we could work on another check list item?""

He smiled. ""I'm not hard yet, but--""

I interrupted and said ""Maybe one of the things you don't need to be hard for? Maybe they'll get you there?""

He nodded, and I pulled out my phone with the list.

""Um... so I very thoroughly washed, and so maybe we start with a rimjob? Get it out of the way?""

I nodded.

""Then golden shower and piss drinking? Get all of that out of the way?""

He nodded, and took a big gulp of water.

I slid onto the floor in front of him on the couch, handing him my phone to record with, and he pulled his legs up to give me access.

His ass was a little hair, but clean and fresh, and as I had so many times in the previous six weeks, I pushed my face in and started licking.

His balls were resting on my eyebrows, as I tongue fucked his ass like a professional. I heard the video start, and smiled at it while catching my breath and dove back in.

Eventually, he stopped me and said panting I emerged from under his balls.

""You did a really good job cleaning.""

His cock was hard, and I knew our chance at watersports was temporarily on hold.

""I can go brush my teeth, and maybe we can try having regular sex?"" I said and he grabbed my wrist and pulled me in for a kiss.

""If my ass is so clean you don't have to brush on my account."" He smiled kindly, and I started kissing him, and crawled up into his lap straddling.

His cock was resting on my belly, my pussy already wet. I kissed him, and then looked at him and smiled.

""I have had a lot of fun getting off with my basic training squad, but I'm ultimately a straight girl, wanting to get fucked properly... And I'm glad it's going to be you.""

We kissed and I lifted myself and pushed his cock under me, until I felt the tip pressing against my pussy. I closed my eyes, and held my breath as I slowly sank onto it, and it entered me.

There was a bit of tension, and it hurt as I pressed past it, then it was ok. When I was all the way down, and he was as deep inside me as he could get, I sat and kissed him, and he wiped away a couple of tears I hadn't realized I had shed.

""You're so beautiful..."" he told me, and I kissed him again.

I started to slowly rise and fall on his cock, adjusting the arch in my back to find where it felt the best. His thumb started rubbing my clit and I tilted back a but, so the head of his cock was rubbing my front vaginal wall, and he began sucking on my tits as he continued to rub.

In the six weeks of basic training one of our workouts had been stamina training for all different types of cowgirl, but without the benefit of a cock inside us. I was feeling up for riding him as long as necessary. Turned out it took a while, despite how good it felt pretty quickly, but eventually, my riding and his rubbing and sucking had me cumming hard.

After I came, it only took a couple more pumps before he filled my hot wet pussy with his second massive load.

We kissed, and didn't move for a couple minutes, before I finally climbed off of him, and he went grabbed me some tissue so I didnt drip all the way to the bathroom. There was a reddish color on his cock.

He got in the shower, and a minute later I joined him. Putting my phone on the counter. We kissed and I washed his cock thoroughly.

""Do you have to pee?"" I asked him.

He nodded, and I turned off the shower, reached for my phone, handed it to him and knelt.

I didn't want to be peed on, or to drink it, but I understood many clients would be wanting this, and I needed to do my duty.

I smiled up at him, he started the camera, and he started peeing. My chest tightened, and I tried not to blush, but I felt so dirty.

After what felt like a lot of pee, he stopped, and said ""you want to check both boxes right now?""

I nodded and opened wide. He started peeing right into my mouth. It was hot and had an odd taste, not as bad as I worried but not good. I gulped and opened four times, and suddenly my belly felt really heavy from cum and piss.

I smiled and said ""Thank you baby"" to the camera, when he was done.

He washed up, and got out allowing me to wash myself thoroughly. I gargled water and brushed my teeth again. I burped and tasted a mix of cum and piss. I felt gross, but proud.

Once I was clean, and dry, I joined him on the couch again. I sent off my first few proof of achievement videos to Mistress Mandy, and then sent them to Gemma.

""Sorry, about the pee. It's not really my thing.""

My legs were drapped over his lap, and I laid back.

""I really like you..."" I said. He was like a father figure, but I saw him as a sexual being.

""I really like you too.""

There was a comfortable quiet for minutes, then I broke it.

""You work as a cameraman on the news?""

He nodded.

""Which show?""

""The Evening News with Angela Mercado."" He perked up saying her name, and I did too.

""Oh my god, we watched that show every night at my home. My mom thinks my dad visited Angela Mercado when she was in the SWC. He just loves her.""

Hank smiled. ""She's amazing. I was already working there when she came out of the corps, and started as a field reporter. I was the caneraman on her famous rape row segment that landed her the anchor job.""

""I haven't seen it. I went into basic training on my 18th birthday, so I havent got to see any of those reports. My parents would send us to bed and watch the 'state of the corps' specials without us.""

""Can I show you a state of the corps special that Angela and I shot that I'm most proud of?""

I nodded, and sat up excitedly. He turned on the TV and started to search until he found a 9 minute segment called ""Bukkake Benefits,"" and clicked it.

Angela was probably 28 in the video, she had retired from the corps at 25 to go into journalism, it was a shorter program, but required at least three 6 week tours of rape row. Journalists were a special breed.

Angela was brunette, and wearing a pretty but non-seductive business dress, and standing outside of a brothel building, most looked the same--high rise 22nd century.

""I'm here today at the Minneapolis Brothel District. Minneapolis's Brothel District is home to one Corps member, who has made quite a name for herself, Dina Farrell.""

The camera cut to Angela talking in a domicile almost identical to Dina, a naked blonde, with perfect teeth and oversized blue eyes, and pink nipples.

""Look at you Angie, on the nightly news!"" She said excitedly.

""Dina and I were bunkmates in basic training in Alexandria. Before she came up here to help with an understaffed brothel district.""

Dina smiled and said, ""That's actually how I came to find I was good at servicing multiple men. I volunteered for a train session, to help with backlog.""

While she spoke it cut to a clip of her being filled airtight by black cocks. She was smiling and looked so lustful. I began touching myself as she worked them.

""The girls in my building call me 'the Gangbang Queen'.""

They cut back to Angela and Dina on the couch. Angela spoke directly to camera.

""In the nine years since joining the Sex Worker Corps, Dina has serviced nine hundred, nintety-nine thousand, nine hundred and thirty seven individual cocks. At 27 years old, she is poised to beat the previous million cock record by two and a half years. We're going to be with her over the next twenty four hours, while she works through her remaining 63 cocks.""

The rest of the segment showed her sucking and fucking and at the end, with only a few cocks remaining, all the men who had been there for the day, came on her face and tits. The segment ended with a big smile gooey smile and her blowing a kiss, with her eyes covered completely.

""Wow,"" I said to Hank as it ended.

He nodded. ""She's still going. It's been seven years since that segment, and apparently she's topped 2 million, they had to move her to a new city every year to keep her numbers up. She's working in being the first woman to 5 million. I think she's in Mexico City.""

I was in awe.

""She's become the biggest recruiting tool. Someone who just loves the corps, and doesn't seem to have an ambition outside the corps.""

I nodded. ""Did you fuck her?""

He blushed and nodded.

""It's nothing to be embarrassed about. She's beautiful, and clearly very happy to serve.""

We sat quietly until my phone dinged, and I had a video from Gemma. I slide closer to Hank, and he put his arm around me, and we watched her get fucked in the ass, suck the cock and take a thick facial. Her patrner's balls were as big as Hank's and her face looked like several men had cum on her. She grinned and licked some into her mouth.

Hank's cock stirred a little at the sight. I grinned at him.

""You think she's hot? She was my bunkmate...""

""She's really hot. But, you're better.""

We kissed a little, and my phone alarm went off, letting me know it was work out time. I went to ignore it, and he asked what it was. He volunteered to go down to the gym with me. I put in my workout bra, and some socks and sneakers, and he put on boxer briefs that kept him from bouncing, socks and sneakers, and we went to the gym on the top floor of the building.

There were a lot of glistening women naked except for heavy sports bras and sneakers. I saw why Hank was open to coming with me.

""You wanted to workout?"" I whispered to him with a giggle.

""Yes, I've been around naked women a lot, this isn't nearly as special as having a week with a beautiful young cadet,"" he said sincerely.

""I heard back in the day, when the corps started they called us cunt cadets, but as the stigma around sex work wore off and the greater good was seen, the name faded... You ever use that term?""",,2025-08-15T18:53:50.693660,3786,2.0

Turns out spider silk is exactly as strong as they say it is. This becomes very apparent when it's in such copious amounts that a regular spider could never dream of spinning. Surprisingly resistant to magic, too. But after trying several possible solvents and applying enough leverage, she's free.

Brushing the bits of silk that got into her hair take nearly twice as long, however. The bits in her clothes will be an ongoing project.

Mistress is not pleased. It didn't help that the whole time I'm trying to free her and get her hair and skin silk-free, we're subject to the sound of Miss Charlotte vigorously making love to Master, upstairs. He can certainly force some sounds from all of us, but honestly, I think she's laying it on a little thick, just to be a bitch.

That being said, I would just like to take a moment to appreciate Master's stamina. I'm not implying my pussy has the power to wear a normal man out or anything, but he did just finish fucking me before he took her to bed.

It's not until I get her into a bath that she seems to relax.

""Melody, your fingers are magic,"" she says idly as I massage the shampoo against her scalp.

""Um, I'm not using any... oh, you mean... right,"" she looks back at me and smiles for the first time since the argument.

""What kind of coffee do we have in the house? Do we have any of the forest elf blend you got ahold of awhile back?"" she idly asks.

""Hmm. I think so, a little. Did you want me to make you some?""

""No, that's alright. It had a very mild flavor, but was still rather strong, yes?"" she stares across the room, like she's trying to piece something together.

""It was,"" I tell her.

""Do you think it's mild enough that you could mix it with something? So that you can't tell that it's coffee?""

""Hmm. No probably not, it's mild, but it's not quite that mild. Are you trying to get Master to try it again? He was pretty firm about his feelings on coffee,"" I reach for the pitcher and start rinsing her hair.

""No, no, nothing like that. What about that fox-folk tea? Could you do it with that? Mix it so that you get the caffeine, but don't taste it?"" she leans forward so that I can rinse the rest of her hair.

""You could. Though it doesn't have much caffeine in it, really. It made us all a little jittery, but I think it was the herbs they mix in it, not the caffeine,"" I slowly start working in the conditioner.

She just leans back and seems to stare off into space.

""If you're looking for caffeine without the taste, they do sell pills and powders that you can mix into things,"" I tell her, still not sure what this is all about.

""That's a good point,"" she says, then pauses, ""Do we have any of that tooth gel? The numbing creme, I mean. I got it for that toothache. That may have been a couple years ago.""

An odd switch of topics, ""No, I believe it passed it's expiration and I threw it out.""

""Ahh, just as well then,"" she sits up as I start rinsing the conditioner as well.

When we're finally finished, she gets up and I start toweling her off. Another moment I would like to take to just appreciate how beautiful Mistress is.

""Melody, if I make you a list, could you run out to the store and pick up a few things before dinner? It's nothing major, just some odds and ends,"" she says as she slides her clothes on.

""Of course, Mistress, I'd be happy to.""

That she specified before dinner made me think that they were going to be food items. They were not.

Did you know that caffeine affects spiders very differently than humans, elves, or most other mammals? Because I didn't. Mistress did, though. And it apparently applies to spidergirls. She's really smart like that.

I knew something was up from the strange shopping list, and then Mistress insisted on taking over making dinner. I knew sitting down that we were in for another adventure, but what could I do? Mistress is my Mistress.

Dinner starts off normal, if a little icy. That's to be expected, considering the friction in the household lately. Mistress is being surprisingly polite to Miss Charlotte, though. It's not normal polite, though. I don't know if Miss Charlotte can tell, she doesn't know Mistress as well as I do. It's more of a 'I already won' kind of pleased-with-oneself sort of polite.

But if she did notice, it doesn't matter for long, because she starts getting a little odd. And not just odd-because-she's-a-giant-spider-and-kind-of-a-bitch sort of way. Odd in a sloppy, less than graceful way that is unlike her.

""So... you have trouble with your hair earlier?"" Miss Charlotte asks, her multiple eyes looking a little oddly wide.

""It was no trouble at all, really. Melody is great with a brush,"" Mistress tells her, nonchalantly.

It was not no trouble. It was actually a lot of trouble. But I am great with a brush, and it's so nice of her to say so.

""This is really good,"" Miss Charlotte says, ""I'm impressed. A good cook and good at warming up cock for me.""

That was surprisingly crass for out-of-the-bedroom talk, even for her. What's moreso is when I feel a long arachnoid leg slide up beneath my dress and roughly knock against the metal plate protecting my nether regions. Curse me if I ever complain about the chastity belt again. Also, I was not 'warming him up', Master chose to make use of me before her, that doesn't diminish our act of lovemaking just because she came after. Honestly, what does she think she is, human?

""Actually, I made dinner tonight,"" Mistress informs her, without making eye contact.

""Really, now? That mean you're going to start warming-"" I can see Mistress' jaw setting as Miss Charlotte speaks. Fortunately, Master interrupts her before any confrontation can happen.

""Charlotte, are you alright? You seem a little-"" he begins, before being cut off himself.

""Great! I'm actually feeling a little great. Wanna go for a quickie after dinner? Or hell, right now! I can even spin us a hammock for it,"" she gets up, rather wobbly and tries to spin some webbing, but it goes horribly awry and sprays all along the walls and ceiling in a haphazard pattern.

""Whoops!"" she declares, ""Hold on! Imma-"" she starts to spray again but tumbles, losing balance even with eight legs, and crashes to the ground, ""Imma take a quick nap, k?""

We move her to the couch, though we probably all weren't needed. She's a lot lighter than she looks. Master gives suspicious glances to Mistress as we do so, and she just gives him a playful look in return.

Mistress tells him that she and I will do the dishes while he goes off to his study. Mistress tells me to bring the rest of the things I bought earlier. The way she smiles makes me a little uncomfortable.

That is one sturdy coffee table in the living room. I doubt the carpenter intended it to be a surface for confining a giant spider, but here we are.

We use her own silk. It turns out that harvesting silk from a spidergirl is not fundamentally different from harvesting from a regular spider. If it's sedated, then once you start pulling the thread, it just sort of comes out. The trick is getting the right kind of silk first, because spiders produce different kinds from different glands in the spinneret, which why sometimes it seems stickier or thicker than other times. This experience has me learning far more about spiders than I ever wanted to.

After disrobing her, we start by separating her leg, the two front and two back ones on each side are tied together. Then the tied legs are brought under the table and tied together, as well as to the table legs. Mistress is shockingly good with her knots. This is clearly not the first time she's done this. I'd go on again about how amazing she is, and she is, but it's also a little frightening this time.

Miss Charlotte's arms are pulled behind her back, and her forearms are tied horizontally to each other. Mistress creates a sort of harness around her chest (and looping around her breasts, though I get the feeling that wasn't strictly necessary) with the end extending all the way to the ceiling, where she attaches it to a hook that was formerly used to hang plants. It is a suspiciously strong hook, considering it shouldn't have been meant to hold the weight of any sort of body. I feel like there are things Mistress isn't telling me.

Finally, her pedipalps, which sprout off from where a normal human's legs would be. This is where spidergirl anatomy gets odd. On a regular spider, between the pedipalps is where its mouth would be. On Miss Charlotte, she keeps her lady bits there. Master had made some joke before about Freud would have a field day with that, but I didn't really understand what he meant.

We spread them wide apart, tying them to the already bound legs on either side, leaving her completely exposed. I'll admit, the excessive lewdness was a bit much. Mistress asked if I was feeling okay at this point, as apparently I was flushed beet red.

""I impress myself sometimes,"" Mistress tells me, admiring her handiwork, ""especially when I have my little helper.""

She pats me on the head and I blush again.

I'm surprised as she turns and steps away, ""Mistress, we're not going to just leave her here... are we?""

""Of course not, but we have some time until she comes to. Join me on the couch, Melody, will you?"" she smiles, pulling off her sweater, ""Oh, and disrobe.""",,2025-08-15T18:54:21.999858,1698,
https://www.literotica.com/s/rekindled-desire-pt-01,Rekindled Desire Pt. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"Joshua and Shae had been married six years and a month when they called it quits. In truth, it was actually more of Shae's decision.

Shae had been harboring guilty feelings about her lack of sex drive for most of their marriage. Joshua soldiered through and never complained. Shae felt bad, but didn't know how to help. Since she was young, Shae was raised with the idea that sex was sinful and shameful, and this notion continued to be deeply ingrained in her. It was more of an obligation. Despite her deep love for Joshua, Shae's unresolved issues prevented their relationship from flourishing.

After a few years, being intimate even once a month became a strain as the novelty of being newlyweds faded. Joshua thought it was his fault. He tried to spark their relationship by surprising Shae with romance gifts and date nights, but nothing seemed to excite her. Now, the couple's bond could be described as nothing more than a friendship.

Joshua never complained and always remained loving and optimistic. Shae had always found comfort in her husband's determination and love, as Joshua remained a faithful dotting husband year after year. He remained encouraging and emotionally available, and always hopeful his bride would return to him.

Everything changed one day when Shae joked about how repulsive it is for guys to watch porn. Joshua found it difficult to find the humor in her comment, and the truth was out.

Shae felt appalled by Joshua's choice to watch porn to cope with their nonexistent sex life. This wasn't the man she married. This was a pervert. It was too much for her to take. Shae packed a small bag and left for her mother's house that night.

Joshua felt devastated. He loved Shae with all his heart and was trying all he could to make the marriage work. Despite all their years together, Shae labeled him unfaithful, and their lines of communication were abruptly severed.

Joshua had always prided himself on his physical fitness, and now he poured all his energy into his workouts. Joshua would spend hours at the gym, pushing himself to the limits and channeling his emotions into each rep and set.

As he looked at his reflection in the gym mirrors, Joshua couldn't help but notice the streaks of gray flecking his mahogany hair. It seemed like he was just yesterday in the prime of his life, but now the signs of aging were beginning to show. However, Joshua refused to let that deter him. He was determined to use his gym time as an outlet for his anxiety and frustration, focusing on building his strength and stamina instead of his crumbling marriage. The intense physical exertion only provided a temporary escape from the heartbreak he felt.

For a long time, Shea had been frustrated with their relationship. If she was truly honest, guilt overwhelmed her more than anything. But the thought of Joshua fantasying about younger, more endowed women was too much for her to stomach.

In reality, Shea's stunning physique always turned heads wherever she went. Her perfectly proportioned curves accentuated her shapely ass. Shae's wavy amber lock and hazel eyes only added to her captivating and irresistible air. Despite understanding Joshua's unwavering dedication to her, Shea couldn't escape the overwhelming sensation of jealousy.

A little over a month had passed since the couple had gone their separate ways. Shae had been living with her parents until she could find a place of her own. Leaving Joshua depressed and alone in their apartment.

Joshua ended up ordering pizza nearly daily. It was difficult not to notice that the same pretty young pizza girl delivered several times in a row.

It didn't take long for some friendly banter to develop. The pizza girl was the first to break the ice. ""Are you hungry or are you just starting to miss me?"" She quipped. ""You sure don't look like someone who orders this much pizza.""

The gorgeous girl's flirtatious comments froze Joshua in place. He hadn't flirted with a pretty girl in ages, but the pizza girl's charm was irresistible. Her tight fitting polo caught his attention, but it was her piercing blue eyes that made his heart skip a beat. She had a subtle and youthful presence, accentuated by her porcelain skin and messy raven hair, that playfully escaped from under her ball cap.

The pizza girl noted Joshua's endearing shyness and giggled. ""My name's Bree, by the way."" She winked. ""Thanks for the tip."" As she turned and left, Joshua was in a daze, embarrassed and dumbfounded. Did he say anything? He swore to himself to do better next time.

A couple of days later, the pizza girl returned, and Joshua resolved to make up for the awkwardness of their last encounter. He answered the door with a ready smile. ""I'm Joshua."" He blurted out. Bree couldn't help but smile. Her plump red lips curled upwards as she fought to suppress her laughter.

""I know. It's on the receipt."" A giggle escaped her lips as she couldn't resist finding Joshua hopelessly adorable and handsome. ""You're really cute, you know?"" Now it was Bree's turn to blurt out words without thinking. Embarrassed, her fair complexion flushed with a rosy shade of crimson.

Joshua's nerves were already shot, but Bree's awkward compliment eased the tension enough for him to take notice of her as more than just a pizza girl. His heart leapt ahead of his mind, and he surprised both of them. ""You want to get a cup of coffee sometime?""

Butterfly's exploded in Bree's chest, practically answering yes for her. Bree's face lit up with a radiant smile as she eagerly passed her phone to Joshua, ""I'm off tomorrow, Tiger."" Bree answered with a wink, as Joshua franticly added his number to her contacts. ""I'll find a quiet spot and text you round 10?""

""Sounds great,"" Joshua exclaimed with a wide grin, his heart pounding in his chest like a bass drum. He felt like a teenager again. Bree, not content with just words, leaned in closer, her soft touch sending a rush of warmth through Joshua's skin. Her vanilla scent lingered as she kissed his cheek, overwhelming him with her sweet and intoxicating aroma.

""See you then."" Bree smiled back with a devilish grin. Joshua's head was swimming as he watched Bree's taut ass turn and bounce down the hall. Joshua felt like she was going to melt. The weight that had been dragging him down was beginning to ease, he felt alive again.

For their date, Bree picked a quaint little coffee shop on Main St, just around the corner from a trendy spa.

The coffee shop had a cozy atmosphere with exposed brick walls and vintage furniture. Arriving early, Joshua couldn't help but feel optimistic as he picked out a table in a cozy, sun-drenched corner. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, tempting Joshua's senses even before he laid eyes on Bree.

As Bree walked in, her casual attire highlighted her natural beauty. Out of her uniform, Bree was ravishing. Her radiant, youthful smile brightened the room. Bree's flowing raven hair cascaded down her shoulders, accentuating her delicate features. Joshua struggled to remain focused on their conversation, his eyes involuntarily drifting towards her alluring, youthful, smooth cleavage.

Joshua, still lost in his thoughts, failed to notice as the waitress began taking their orders. Bree chuckled softly as Joshua slowly realized it was his turn to order. ""Ummm, black yeah yeah.""

""You are out of practice, aren't you?"" Bree giggled endearingly as the waitress walked away.

Joshua blushed and shrugged. ""Well, yeah, I have to be honest.... I've been well... I am kinda, uh, married."" Joshua cringed. Why'd I have to be so honest? Joshua kicked himself. This was going to be a short date. ""Separated, for a while actually, but yeah..."" Joshua stammered, his hands trembling as he absentmindedly stirred his coffee, dreading Bree's inevitable reaction.

Bree was no where near shocked and really pleasantly surprised. This shed light on why Joshua was so endearing and allayed her fears. ""I have to be honest, too."" Bree smiled warmly as she reached across the table and cupped his hands. ""I have a girlfriend.""

Joshua could only stare. Bree's revelation left him bewildered and uncertain of what to think. Bree's cute giggle cut the confused tension. ""It's more like a friend's with benefits thing. Don't worry.""

This was heartening for Joshua to hear, and more than a little intriguing. Joshua's wife didn't even like to have sex with guys. Was this hot young girl that sensual and outgoing?

As if reading his mind, Bree leaned in and whispered. ""I like cock.""

Joshua's eyes widened at Bree's steamy words. He wasn't expecting her to be so open. The atmosphere at the table crackled with a palpable mix of sexual tension and anticipation. Joshua couldn't help but feel drawn to Bree's youthful, raw sensual energy.

With a mischievous smile, Bree continued, ""But don't worry, Joshua. This doesn't have to complicate things. We can keep it casual, just enjoy each other's... company. No expectations.""

The chemistry between them was undeniable. Joshua's mind raced. His mind kept drifting to Shea, but the irresistible allure of Bree was impossible to ignore. He couldn't deny that his own desires had been unfulfilled for some time.

Joshua took a deep breath, and his instincts took control. ""You want to get some dinner later?""

""Only if it's at your place."" Bree winked. She continued to smile as she stood and gathered her purse. ""Thanks for the coffee. I'm off at 8, I'll text you, cutie.""

Joshua stood up and Bree moved closer, their bodies melting into a warm and tender embrace. ""Can't wait, tiger."" Joshua stood up and Bree moved closer, their bodies melting into a warm and tender embrace. ""Can't wait, tiger."" Bree's tempting whisper lingered in his ear, sending a shiver down his spine.

Joshua's heart pounded as he watched Bree walk away, her hips swaying with a captivating grace. Her hand gently grazed his tenting pants as she passed, sending a jolt of desire through his body, leaving him longing for more. Joshua couldn't help but wonder if Bree's teasing gesture was intentional, a playful hint of what awaited them later. He felt like a love drunk teenager, with renewed anticipation. Joshua couldn't wait for the night ahead.

---

Shae's mom suggested a massage to relax. Shae had been separated from her husband for months, but the residual anxiety took its toll. ""You need to relax!"" Her mom instructed, handing her a gift card for the spa so she couldn't refuse. ""I made you an appointment later this morning. Be there at 10.""

Taurus Day Spa was on a quaint little corner downtown, right across the street from Shae's favorite coffee shop. The interior had the familiar appearance of a doctor's office, but with the added touch of lush tropical plants and the soothing scent of coconut in the air.

Greeting Shae inside was a peppy receptionist, barely visible behind the tall counter. All Shae could discern was the receptionist's youthful, sparkling eyes and tousled dark hair. ""Hey, welcome to the Spa. Appointment or walk in?""

""Um, appointment. I'm Shae.""

""Oh, OK great! Nicole will be right with you.""

Soon, the door beside the front desk opened. Smiling back in the doorway was a woman. She looked professional in her form-fitting khakis, which emphasized her long legs, and a tight polo that accentuated her head-turned breasts. Her short neon blue hair stood out against her fair, smooth skin.

Nicole's unique appearance caught Shae's attention. As they made eye contact, Shae felt immediate ease and comfort. Nicole introduced herself as the massage therapist and led Shae to a cozy room filled with soft music and dimmed lights.

Shae and Nicole discussed any specific areas of tension or discomfort, ensuring that the massage would be tailored specifically to her needs. Shae mentioned her persistent anxiety and the toll it had taken on her. Nicole nodded understandingly and assured her that she would do her best to help her relax and unwind.

As the massage began, Shae immediately felt the tension in her muscles start to melt away. Nicole's soft touch was warm and comforting. The slight melony scent of her lotion contributed to the relaxing tropical atmosphere.

Nicole's skilled hands worked their magic, applying just the right amount of pressure to release the knots in Shae's shoulders and back.

Shae couldn't help but feel a sense of trust and connection with Nicole. It was as if her touch was not only relieving her physical tension, but also providing much-needed emotional release. Shae opened up about her separation from her husband and the anxiety it had brought into her life.

""That's terrible. No wonder you're so tense."" Nicole mused as her skilled hands moved down Shae's tan thighs. Shae quivered slightly at her tender touch, more commanding and sensual than she expected.

""Wow, your hands feel like a dream. A lot better than being manhandled."" Shae chuckled nervously.

""Sometimes you just need a woman's touch."" Nicole whispered sensually and reassuringly. Nicole's touch seemed to be warming her body from the inside out. Her delicate, warm hands were exactly what Shae's body had been aching for. With each caress, Shae's body quivered in desperation. Her heart struggling to keep pace with the flood of endorphins. Her body finally received the intimate touch, which Shae had long rejected.

Nicole was quick to read the desires of Shae's body. ""I think we need to work on some extra areas for you today."" Before Shae could respond, her masseuse removed the towel covering her ass.

Shae shivered and felt the unfamiliar hint of arousal. As Nicole's hands moved to Shae's lower back, Shae's body responded with a mix of relaxation and excitement. The intimate nature of the massage, coupled with Nicole's sensual touch, awakened a desire within Shae that she hadn't felt in a while. It was a surprising and unfamiliar sensation, but one Shae couldn't deny.

Her masseuse's fingers ventured further. They danced down the small of her back before kneading Shae's ass, releasing more and more tension as she did. Now and again Nicole's fingers slightly separated Shae's cheeks, each time venturing further down her ass and closer to her upper thigh, each time closer to her sensitive, needy slit. With each moment Shae sunk deeper into relaxation, she shocked herself with how aroused she was becoming.

Nicole's gentle voice interrupted her thoughts, as if sensing Shae's uncertainty. ""Massages are intimate. Sometimes if you just relax, you learn what your body is trying to tell you, and what you need,"" Nicole whispered, sending chills down Shae's spine. Nicole's sultry words not only provided ease, but also rekindled a desire within her she didn't know existed.

Shae had repressed her sexuality for ages. Nicole's tender and unexpectedly erotic touch was awakening something in her. Shae found her thoughts drifting, yearning for more of her intimate touch, for release.

""Please,"" Shae whispered.

""Do you want to roll over?"" Nicole asked, as if reading Shae's daydreams.

Shae complied without thinking. Her lungs racing to catch up with her heart. The fresh cool air washed over her naked body. A thrilling reminder of how exposed she was.

Nervousness consumed her as she exposed herself to another woman, but there was an irresistible charm about this stranger that compelled her to embrace the experience.

Shae couldn't remember being so vulnerable. She glanced back at Nicole. Her piercing blue eyes radiated a soothing, intimate bond. She leaned in, closer than a friend. ""Close your eyes,"" Nicole whispered. Her gentle touch brushed the hair away from Shae's forehead, instantly calming her racing heart. She did as instructed, leaving herself alone with Nicole's sultry form lingering over her naked body.

Nicole massaged Shae's shoulders with a deep hypnotic rhythm. Her hand glided up her clavicles, finally reaching the top of her breasts. Over and back, lulling Shae deeper into relaxation.

Shae giggled nervously. The massage was so relaxing and intimate, she couldn't help but be turned on. Even worse, she couldn't stop thinking of Joshua and imagining his strong hands lingering all over her body.

""I'm sorry."" Shae sighed. ""I was never good at this. I uh, never even let my husband touch me like this in case he got the wrong impression.""

""It's perfectly natural. Massages are a very intimate thing."" Nicole smiled as she slowly massaged Shae's voluminous breasts. Butterflies were exploding in Shae's chest. Feelings and desires she had long buried were taking over.

Then something unexpected happened. Nicole's delicate fingers brushed Shae's sensitive nipples. Shae felt alarmed, but quickly dismissed it as an accident. But why did it feel so good? Shae's heart raced as she secretly hoped Nicole would make another 'mistake.'

Nicole moved back to her shoulders and down her arms. Shae let out a sigh. Sure, it felt good, but Shae longed for more. Nicole heard Shae's sigh and chuckled to herself, slowly maneuvering her hand back down Shae's chest. ""Are you feeling relaxed yet?"" Nicole whispered in Shae's ear as her fingers reached her client's greedy nipple.

Shae let out a gasp of relief, reveling in the stimulating sensation. Instead of answering, Shae panted heavily, her breaths coming in short, rapid bursts as she arched her back to urge on Nicole's touch.

""If you want to spread your legs a little bit, I think we know where you're holding most of your tension."" Shae's heart raced. Was she saying what she thought she was?

Shae's mind was flooded with conflicting emotions as she tentatively embraced the unfamiliar sensations. She had never felt attracted to women before, and the feelings bombarding her both excited and confused her. She questioned whether it was just the vulnerability of the moment or if there was something deeper at play.

Shae was panting, overwhelmed as her desire took control. ""Seriously, this is embarrassing.""

""Maybe it's something you need to get out of your system. Just close your eyes."" Nicole gazed at Shae with a soulful, encouraging look, reassuring Shae into closing her eyes. ""Relax."" She whispered against the sensitive skin of Shae's abdomen, as her lips began a teasing journey between her thighs.

Shae's heart raced with a combination of nervousness and anticipation, as Nicole's delicate fingers delicately traced along her exposed lips. Shae shivered with excitement.

""I've never..."" Shae gasped as Nicole's warm breath brushed the delicate folds of her labia. ""...but I need it so bad."" The sound of Shae's whimpering echoed through the room. ""Please... please.""

Nicole listened, but didn't give in. She planted tender kisses around Shae's needy core until she bucked and moaned with longing. Nicole's lips latched onto Shae's clit and alternated, sucking and licking it, while occasionally plunging her tongue as deeply as she could into her.

If Shae wasn't so overcome with pleasure, she would have screamed. Shae could only writhe and moan in euphoria. A man had never evoked the insane pleasure Shae was experiencing. The skilled masseuse had already pushed her closer to orgasm faster than she could herself.

""Yes, yessss oh fuck yes."" Shae's moans drowned out the relaxing melodies of within the small room. Her body quivered and shook as she was transported to a world of ecstasy.

Shae couldn't remember the last time she had an orgasm that was complete and satisfying. But she couldn't remember the last time she let someone be that close either.

""Sometimes, to truly let go, you just need to let someone else take control."" Nicole mused, putting words to Shae's wistful thoughts.

""Thank you,"" Shae panted as she struggled to catch her breath, and she meant it.

While Shae cleaned up and got dressed, she couldn't help but feel a wave of relaxation wash over her, as if all her worries were being lifted away. Thankful for Nicole's skilled hands and compassionate demeanor, she thanked her again for the amazing, transformative experience. Nicole smiled warmly, grateful to have made a positive impact on Shae.",,2025-08-15T18:54:55.652762,3349,
https://www.literotica.com/s/teaching-the-babysitter-ch-02,Teaching the Babysitter Ch. 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"When I walked back into the house Alexis was still standing by the front door, clearly nervous about what today would have in store.

""Okay, how are you feeling?"" I asked her as I walked towards Alexis.

""Uh... Nervous."" she said as she stood there with her arms wrapped around herself.

""Yeah, that's understandable. Just try to relax and just enjoy the day, okay?"" I said.

Alexis just nodded, avoiding eye contact.

""Do you want to go up stairs and I'll meet you up there in a minute?"" I asked.

Alexis nodded again.

""Okay, why don't you go up to the guest bedroom across from the baby's room. I need to grab a few things and then I'll meet you up there."" I said, gently rubbing Alexis' back to comfort her.

I watched as Alexis walked up the stairs, studying her hips moving back and forth as she climbed each step. Her clothes were baggy, so I couldn't see much of her figure through her clothes.

I can't wait to be hitting that soon.

I thought to myself.

When she had reached the top of the stairs I turned around and walked into my office and grabbed a shopping bag I had been using to keep the supplies I had been collecting over the past couple of days.

I opened the bag to make sure I had everything.

Condoms, lube, pills, wipes...

I pulled the box of erectile pills out, and took one, figuring it would take some time to take effect.

Before heading up stairs I went to the kitchen to grab a couple water bottles, figuring they could come in handy if things got really hot and heavy.

As I walked up stairs I could feel myself getting a little anxious. It had been close to 10 years since I had been with someone other than Julie. I'd never cheated on her, but here I was, about to have sex with our babysitter.

When I got to the guest room door I gently knocked.

""Come in."" Alexis said.

I slowly opened the door and walked in. Alexis was sitting on the foot of the queen size bed, her hands tucked under her thighs. She was wearing her usual attire. Baggy sweatpants, and a hoodie.

I picked this guest room because it was the only one with an attached bathroom. This way Alexis and I wouldn't have to walk in and out of the room if we needed to use the bathroom. I had made sure that there were towels, shampoo, and body wash in the bathroom just in case.

""Hey, I got a couple things for us."" I said as I walked over to one of the nightstands next to the bed.

I pulled out a box of condoms and set it down on the nightstand, ""I wasn't sure if we needed these, so I figured I'd make sure we had some.""

""Oh... I actually got some too."" she said as she reached into the pocket of her hoodie and pulled out a 3-pack of condoms.

""Well, I'm glad you came prepared."" I joked, hoping it would break the ice.

""I know some guys don't like using them, so uh... I actually started taking birth control a couple months ago. If you'd prefer to not use them that's okay too."" Alexis explained.

Jeez, I hadn't even thought about fucking Alexis raw...

I thought to myself.

""Whatever makes you more comfortable."" I saw, trying to contain my surprise.

Next I pulled out the bottle of lube and set it down next to the box of condoms, ""Just in case we need some lube.""

Then I pulled out the four water bottles I brought up with me, ""I figured it was a good idea to stay hydrated.""

Alexis actually chuckled at that comment, so at least I was finally starting to break the ice.

I didn't want Alexis to know about the pills so I left those in the bag and tossed it on the floor. Then I got laid down on the bed. Alexis sat there with her back to me so I patted a spot next to me. Alexis turned around to see what I was doing.

""Want to cuddle?"" I asked.

Alexis stayed silent, but crawled up next to me and laid down. I wrapped my arm around Alexis and pulled her in tight. My nose filled with the distinct perfume Alexis would wear.

I rolled over onto my side so I was facing Alexis and I looked into her eyes.

""You okay?"" I whispered.

Alexis nodded, ""Yeah, I'm just nervous.""

""Yeah. I get it. Do you want to kiss?""

Alexis froze and looked into my eyes for a moment and then slowly nodded.

I leaned my head in slowly and planted my lips on Alexis'. It wasn't just Alexis' first kiss, it was my first time kissing someone other than my wife in nearly a decade. It was strange. Alexis' lips were plump and full. They felt nice against mine. Our lips remained locked for a moment before I broke the kiss.

I pressed my forehead into hers and whispered, ""How was that?""

Alexis looked into my eyes again and bit her bottom lip, ""It was really nice.""

I leaned in again and kissed Alexis. We kissed for a while, before I started to explore her body with my hand. First I felt along her back. I let my hand slowly drift down her back until it was on her ass. Since she always wore baggy clothes I never knew what her body looked like. But as I touched her ass, feeling the curves I had imagined, my imagination didn't match reality. I was surprised when I felt how firm her ass was. I gently squeezed it and Alexis inhaled sharply.

""Like that?"" I whispered.

""Mhmmm"" Alexis moaned.

""Want to feel me?""

She nodded, so I took Alexis' hand and guided it to my ass. She wasted no time feeling me up, grabbing my ass.

Alexis and I were now making out. Our tongues exploring each other's mouths. I decided to push things further so I let my hand roam over to her flat stomach. When Alexis didn't move my hand away I continued to move it up until I could feel the bottom of her breast. I paused for a moment, giving Alexis a chance to push my hand away. When she didn't I moved it up so my hand was cupping her entire breast.

Similar to her ass, Alexis' baggy clothes concealed her boobs. As my hand felt her breasts through her hoodie I noticed how firm they were. They were also a decent size, approximately the size of my hand.

I could sense Alexis' breathing change, it was now much more shallow, like she was enjoying me playing with her breasts.

Alexis still had her hand on my ass. I figured if I was feeling her boobs, it was only fair to let her feel my cock. I took her hand and pulled it off my ass and placed it on my crotch. At first she just rubbed it, so it wasn't long before she was squeezing it. I was wearing gray sweatpants, so as Alexis' hand squeezed my cock it felt like she was wrapping her hand around my shaft.

""Mmmm"" I moaned.

Our making out was now heavy. Alexis was really into it. Whatever ice there was between us had now melted and she was really getting into it. So much so that soon she grabbed my hand and moved it from her boobs down to her pussy.

I ran my hand over the crotch of her sweatpants trying to find the opening between her lips. When I found it I started to run my middle finger between her lips, through her sweatpants.

""Oh!"" she moaned.

""Does that feel good?"" I whispered.

""Mhm."" she moaned into my mouth.

Just then I felt Alexis' hand reach up into the waistband of my pants. She stretched it slightly so her hand could slip inside. I could feel her warm hand grab my bare cock.

I let out a soft moan as she started to rub my cock with the palm of her hand.

I then opened my eyes and stared directly into Alexis' big brown eyes.

""What do you think?"" I whispered.

""It feels nice. It's so hard and the skin is so soft. I also didn't think it would be so big."" she whispered.

""Mmmmm..."" I moaned as she continued to explore my member with her bare hand.

I was lost in the sensation of this 19 year old girl playing with my cock. It was the first new hand to touch my cock since before Julie and I started dating. It felt foreign, but was extremely erotic to think about.

After a while I got up off the bed. Alexis laid there, anxious about what I was about to do. I reached for the hem of my black t-shirt and pulled it up over my head and dropped it on the floor, revealing my bare chest and stomach. I've always been a little on the athletic side, but I've put on a couple pounds since becoming a dad. I wasn't fat, I was still a healthy weight, but definitely not in prime condition.

Alexis laid frozen on the bed studying my topless body.

My chest had a thin patch of hair with a happy trail that flowed over my stomach before disappearing in the waistband of my sweatpants.

Next I pinched the waistband of my pants and boxes and pulled them down past my knees. Before standing up to do the final reveal for Alexis I kicked them off my ankles and onto the floor, next to my shirt.

I stood up, giving Alexis a prime view of my naked body. Her jaw hung open and she saw a naked man for the first time ever. She could now see my hard cock as it sprung out from my body. It wasn't massive. Maybe 6 or 6-1/2 inches long, just above average I've been told. Julie hates pubic hair and refuses to give me head unless I shave it off. Today was no different.

""You okay?"" I asked.

""Uh-huh"" was all Alexis said as she studied my dick.

I laid back down next to her and her eyes continued to roam all over my body.

""Do you have any questions?"" I asked, rubbing my dick in my hand.

""Can I... Can I touch it?"" she asked.

""Of course! It's not like you haven't already."" I joked and removed my hand from my cock.

Alexis timidly moved her hand to my dick and started to crudely play with it. Her eyes were locked on it, refusing to move or look away.

""Is this how I am supposed to do it?"" she asked.

""Do what?""

""Make you cum.""

""Oh, you want to give me a handjob?""

Alexis just nodded her head.

""Here, let me show you."" I said as I pulled her hand off my dick and placed it on my thigh.

I showed her how to stroke my dick. Wrapping my hand around it and sliding it up and down with a slight circular motion once my hand reached the head. Alexis was fascinated watching me jerk off.

Then I pulled my hand back and let Alexis try. The first few strokes were really rough, almost painful. So I stopped her and told her to loosen her grip a little. The next few strokes were nicer. I thought about grabbing the lube on the nightstand and putting some of that on her hand, but I felt a glob of pre-cum form at the tip of my penis and slid down onto Alexis' hand.

She gave my dick a curious look, ""Was that the cum?"" she asked.

I chuckled, ""No, honey. That's just pre-cum. It's like cum, but that's not it.""

""Oh. Okay."" she said, still looking confused.

Watching Alexis stroke my dick, any dick, for the first time was hot. I continued to release pre-cum and the increased lube made her strokes feel better and better. After about 15 minutes or so I could tell I was getting close.

""Okay, Alexis. I'm getting close."" I moaned.

She instantly became nervous and adjusted her position.

""Okay. Uhm. What should I do?"" she asked in a panicked tone.

""You're doing fine. Just keep going and I'm going to cum soon."" I grunted

Alexis nodded her head.

""Just a heads up that it's probably going to shoot pretty far. So try not to get any on your clothes."" I grunted between her strokes.

Alexis shifted herself back, extending her arm out further as she continued stroking my dick.

""Ugh! Here... I... Cum..."" I moaned.

A moment later I began shooting long ropes of cum straight into the air. Alexis, fascinated watching a guy cum for the first time, leaned in close to get a better look and turned my cock towards her right as another spurt of cum escaped from my dick. It landed on her hoodie and she immediately let go of my dick and tried to wipe it off with no success.

I stroked my dick through the rest of my orgasm and Alexis tried to clean the cum off her hoodie. After I finished I collapsed back onto the bed.

""It's okay, Alexis. Don't worry about it.""

""Will it go away?"" she asked.

""Maybe, but it'll probably leave a white mark.""

""Nick, I can't go home with this. My parents would kick me out!"" Alexis exclaimed.

""It's okay, we can put it in the wash and it'll be done before you leave."" I said, reassuring her, ""It's not like you're going to need that much today.""

Alexis giggled and playfully slapped my arm, ""Stop it! I don't want my parents to find out.""

""Why? You're an adult?"" I asked.

""Yeah, but they're super strict. If they knew I was doing this today they would freak out.""

""Really?""

""Mhm. They're like super catholic and want all of us kids to wait until marriage."" she explained.

""So what made you decide to not wait?"" I asked in a curious tone.

""I don't know. I guess I just wanted to know what it was like.""

""Hm. So what do you think so far?"" I asked, trying to gauge her feelings so far.

""It's kinda fun. I like it.""

Alexis cuddled up next to me and we laid there for a while. I think Alexis knew that soon it would be her turn to take off her clothes and I could sense her growing anxiety at the idea. I decided to try to push things further.

""Why don't you take off your clothes and I'll get them in the wash?""

She laid there silently, her anxiety causing her to breathe faster.

""Well, it's just my jacket that needs to be washed."" she said looking down at the cum stain on her hoodie.

""That's true. I can still put it in the wash now if you'd like?""

Alexis hesitated for a moment and then pulled the hoodie up over her head and dropped it on my lap before laying back down, now with just a white t-shirt and sweatpants on.

""Okay... Be right back."" I said as I got up out of the bed with Alexis' hoodie and walked out of the bedroom naked. As I was walking down the stairs to the laundry room I thought about how strange this was to be walking through the house naked with the babysitter up in the guest room, nervously waiting to be fucked.

After I put Alexis' hoodie in the washing machine, I returned to the guest room upstairs where Alexis was waiting. While I was gone she got under the covers. She was now laying on the bed with the covers pulled up past her shoulders. I wondered if she was naked under the covers, so I looked around the room and noticed a pile of clothes on the floor. My cock twitched in the air at the thought of Alexis being naked under the covers.

I walked over to the other side of the bed and grabbed the top of the covers to pull them down, but I stopped myself.

""Want me to get under the covers with you?""

Alexis nodded shyly, and I pulled down the covers, keeping Alexis covered. Then I got into bed and pulled up the covers. I immediately rolled over to wrap my arm around Alexis. I could feel her bare stomach and my cock immediately twitched.

I leaned in to kiss her and we began making out again. My hand started rubbing her flat stomach, but soon I was sliding it up towards her breasts. Just before I reached them I pulled away from our kiss.

""Can I touch them?""

Alexis bit her lower lip and nodded.

My hand gently slid up over Alexis' boob and again my cock twitched. The last time I had felt boobs that weren't Julie's was at my bachelor party. I started to breathe deep with desire. I wanted to jump on top of her and fuck her right then and there.

Feeling her breasts over her hoodie didn't do them justice. Now that I could feel her bare breasts I admired how nice they were. They were a perfect shape, soft yet firm, just big enough to fill your hand. I felt around and found her eraser sized nipples and gave them a gentle squeeze.

""Mmmm..."" Alexis moaned into my mouth.

""Your boobs are so nice."" I whispered into her mouth between kisses.

""Mmmm, I'm glad you like them."" she moaned again as I continued to play with her nipples.

""Can I suck on them?"" I asked.

""My boobs?"" Alexis asked with a concerned face.

""Yeah.""

Alexis froze and bit her lip while she thought about it, then she shook her head no.

""I'd rather not right now.""

""Okay! That's fine, whatever you're comfortable with.""

Alexis sighed in relief, ""Thank you."" she smiled.

I continued to play with her nipples, but I was curious what her pussy felt like.

""Can I touch you down there?"" I asked.

Alexis nodded and I started to slide my hand down her stomach towards her pussy. Soon I could feel some pubic hair on my fingertips and I knew I was close to the promised land. Her entire pubic area was covered in a short patch of hair. The hair even ran down onto her lips. As my hand explored her pubic region I tried to visualize what her pussy looked like. Her lips felt thick and full. I imagined her standing there, two puffy lips between her legs, covered by a patch of public hair.

I decided to see how far she'd let me go, so I took my finger and rubbed it between her lips. Eventually my finger brushed up against her clit and Alexis let out a sharp gasp.

""Oh my god!"" she moaned.

She laid there trying to catch her breath as I continued to explore between her pussy lips. I let my finger brush up against her clit again.

""Oh my god! That feels so good!"" she moaned.

I looked at Alexis who had her head tossed to the side and her eyes closed. I knew what I wanted to do next and I wanted to see the look on Alexis' face when I did it.

I took my finger and pushed it against the opening of her vagina, feeling it slowly give way as it engulfed it. It was very wet and very tight. I wasn't used to having my finger inside such a tight pussy. As my finger entered her, Alexis' eyes shot open with surprise.

She turned her head to look at me, staring right into my eyes.

""Does that feel good?"" I asked her.

All Alexis could do was nod her head.

""God, you're so tight.""

""Uh-huh"" she peeped, as her mouth remained open.

When my finger bottomed out I started to slowly pull it out.

""Ohhhhh"" she moaned as she felt my finger slowly slide out of her pussy.

When just the tip of my finger was left inside her, I pushed back in.

""Oh my god, I feel so full."" she moaned.

I chuckled, ""Well, my dick is a little bit bigger than my finger.""

""Oh my god, I don't know if I can take it. Fuuuuuuck."" she moaned.

It was the first time I had ever heard Alexis curse.

I continued to finger her with my index finger. I would have tried to put a second finger inside her, but she was way too tight and I was afraid of hurting her. I did use my thumb to rub against her clit to provide some additional stimulation.

I could tell Alexis was really getting into me fingering her pussy. She started to buck her hips against my hand.

""God, please don't stop. This feels so good, Nick!"" she moaned.

Suddenly she buried her face into my chest.

""FUCK! I'm going to explode!"" she screamed, ""Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!""

I could feel her pussy convulsing on my finger and her hips started to buck more erratically.

""Damn it, this feels so good!"" she moaned.

I could feel her pussy getting wetter and I figured she was having an orgasm, which might have been her first.

Alexis continued like this for a few minutes before she reached her hand under the covers and grabbed my hand, preventing me from moving it.

""Please stop. I'm really really sensitive down there.""

""Oh yeah?""

""Mhm"" she said, nodding her head that was still pressed against my chest.

""I think you might have just had an orgasm.""

""Mhm... I think so too."" she said, catching her breath.

""Have you ever had one before?""

""I don't think so...""

""Well, I'm honored to have given you your first orgasm."" I kidded.

I slowly removed my finger from her pussy and rested it on top of her pubic area. The two of us laid there while Alexis came down from her orgasm. I was gently stroking her back, admiring her soft skin.

Out of nowhere Alexis said ""Can I try sucking your dick?""

I looked down at her.

""Yeah, absolutely. Today is all about trying new things."" I said, smiling at her.

""So what do I do? Just go down there and suck on it?"" she asked.

""Pretty much...""

Alexis pulled the covers up over her head and slid down the bed. I could feel her straddle my leg as her hairy pussy rested on my leg.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

When I walked back into the house Alexis was still standing by the front door, clearly nervous about what today would have in store.

""Okay, how are you feeling?"" I asked her as I walked towards Alexis.

""Uh... Nervous."" she said as she stood there with her arms wrapped around herself.

""Yeah, that's understandable. Just try to relax and just enjoy the day, okay?"" I said.

Alexis just nodded, avoiding eye contact.

""Do you want to go up stairs and I'll meet you up there in a minute?"" I asked.

Alexis nodded again.

""Okay, why don't you go up to the guest bedroom across from the baby's room. I need to grab a few things and then I'll meet you up there."" I said, gently rubbing Alexis' back to comfort her.

I watched as Alexis walked up the stairs, studying her hips moving back and forth as she climbed each step. Her clothes were baggy, so I couldn't see much of her figure through her clothes.

I can't wait to be hitting that soon.

I thought to myself.

When she had reached the top of the stairs I turned around and walked into my office and grabbed a shopping bag I had been using to keep the supplies I had been collecting over the past couple of days.

I opened the bag to make sure I had everything.

Condoms, lube, pills, wipes...

I pulled the box of erectile pills out, and took one, figuring it would take some time to take effect.

Before heading up stairs I went to the kitchen to grab a couple water bottles, figuring they could come in handy if things got really hot and heavy.

As I walked up stairs I could feel myself getting a little anxious. It had been close to 10 years since I had been with someone other than Julie. I'd never cheated on her, but here I was, about to have sex with our babysitter.

When I got to the guest room door I gently knocked.

""Come in."" Alexis said.

I slowly opened the door and walked in. Alexis was sitting on the foot of the queen size bed, her hands tucked under her thighs. She was wearing her usual attire. Baggy sweatpants, and a hoodie.

I picked this guest room because it was the only one with an attached bathroom. This way Alexis and I wouldn't have to walk in and out of the room if we needed to use the bathroom. I had made sure that there were towels, shampoo, and body wash in the bathroom just in case.

""Hey, I got a couple things for us."" I said as I walked over to one of the nightstands next to the bed.

I pulled out a box of condoms and set it down on the nightstand, ""I wasn't sure if we needed these, so I figured I'd make sure we had some.""

""Oh... I actually got some too."" she said as she reached into the pocket of her hoodie and pulled out a 3-pack of condoms.

""Well, I'm glad you came prepared."" I joked, hoping it would break the ice.

""I know some guys don't like using them, so uh... I actually started taking birth control a couple months ago. If you'd prefer to not use them that's okay too."" Alexis explained.

Jeez, I hadn't even thought about fucking Alexis raw...

I thought to myself.

""Whatever makes you more comfortable."" I saw, trying to contain my surprise.

Next I pulled out the bottle of lube and set it down next to the box of condoms, ""Just in case we need some lube.""

Then I pulled out the four water bottles I brought up with me, ""I figured it was a good idea to stay hydrated.""

Alexis actually chuckled at that comment, so at least I was finally starting to break the ice.

I didn't want Alexis to know about the pills so I left those in the bag and tossed it on the floor. Then I got laid down on the bed. Alexis sat there with her back to me so I patted a spot next to me. Alexis turned around to see what I was doing.

""Want to cuddle?"" I asked.

Alexis stayed silent, but crawled up next to me and laid down. I wrapped my arm around Alexis and pulled her in tight. My nose filled with the distinct perfume Alexis would wear.

I rolled over onto my side so I was facing Alexis and I looked into her eyes.

""You okay?"" I whispered.

Alexis nodded, ""Yeah, I'm just nervous.""

""Yeah. I get it. Do you want to kiss?""

Alexis froze and looked into my eyes for a moment and then slowly nodded.

I leaned my head in slowly and planted my lips on Alexis'. It wasn't just Alexis' first kiss, it was my first time kissing someone other than my wife in nearly a decade. It was strange. Alexis' lips were plump and full. They felt nice against mine. Our lips remained locked for a moment before I broke the kiss.

I pressed my forehead into hers and whispered, ""How was that?""

Alexis looked into my eyes again and bit her bottom lip, ""It was really nice.""

I leaned in again and kissed Alexis. We kissed for a while, before I started to explore her body with my hand. First I felt along her back. I let my hand slowly drift down her back until it was on her ass. Since she always wore baggy clothes I never knew what her body looked like. But as I touched her ass, feeling the curves I had imagined, my imagination didn't match reality. I was surprised when I felt how firm her ass was. I gently squeezed it and Alexis inhaled sharply.

""Like that?"" I whispered.

""Mhmmm"" Alexis moaned.

""Want to feel me?""

She nodded, so I took Alexis' hand and guided it to my ass. She wasted no time feeling me up, grabbing my ass.

Alexis and I were now making out. Our tongues exploring each other's mouths. I decided to push things further so I let my hand roam over to her flat stomach. When Alexis didn't move my hand away I continued to move it up until I could feel the bottom of her breast. I paused for a moment, giving Alexis a chance to push my hand away. When she didn't I moved it up so my hand was cupping her entire breast.

Similar to her ass, Alexis' baggy clothes concealed her boobs. As my hand felt her breasts through her hoodie I noticed how firm they were. They were also a decent size, approximately the size of my hand.

I could sense Alexis' breathing change, it was now much more shallow, like she was enjoying me playing with her breasts.

Alexis still had her hand on my ass. I figured if I was feeling her boobs, it was only fair to let her feel my cock. I took her hand and pulled it off my ass and placed it on my crotch. At first she just rubbed it, so it wasn't long before she was squeezing it. I was wearing gray sweatpants, so as Alexis' hand squeezed my cock it felt like she was wrapping her hand around my shaft.

""Mmmm"" I moaned.

Our making out was now heavy. Alexis was really into it. Whatever ice there was between us had now melted and she was really getting into it. So much so that soon she grabbed my hand and moved it from her boobs down to her pussy.

I ran my hand over the crotch of her sweatpants trying to find the opening between her lips. When I found it I started to run my middle finger between her lips, through her sweatpants.

""Oh!"" she moaned.

""Does that feel good?"" I whispered.

""Mhm."" she moaned into my mouth.

Just then I felt Alexis' hand reach up into the waistband of my pants. She stretched it slightly so her hand could slip inside. I could feel her warm hand grab my bare cock.

I let out a soft moan as she started to rub my cock with the palm of her hand.

I then opened my eyes and stared directly into Alexis' big brown eyes.

""What do you think?"" I whispered.

""It feels nice. It's so hard and the skin is so soft. I also didn't think it would be so big."" she whispered.

""Mmmmm..."" I moaned as she continued to explore my member with her bare hand.

I was lost in the sensation of this 19 year old girl playing with my cock. It was the first new hand to touch my cock since before Julie and I started dating. It felt foreign, but was extremely erotic to think about.

After a while I got up off the bed. Alexis laid there, anxious about what I was about to do. I reached for the hem of my black t-shirt and pulled it up over my head and dropped it on the floor, revealing my bare chest and stomach. I've always been a little on the athletic side, but I've put on a couple pounds since becoming a dad. I wasn't fat, I was still a healthy weight, but definitely not in prime condition.

Alexis laid frozen on the bed studying my topless body.

My chest had a thin patch of hair with a happy trail that flowed over my stomach before disappearing in the waistband of my sweatpants.

Next I pinched the waistband of my pants and boxes and pulled them down past my knees. Before standing up to do the final reveal for Alexis I kicked them off my ankles and onto the floor, next to my shirt.

I stood up, giving Alexis a prime view of my naked body. Her jaw hung open and she saw a naked man for the first time ever. She could now see my hard cock as it sprung out from my body. It wasn't massive. Maybe 6 or 6-1/2 inches long, just above average I've been told. Julie hates pubic hair and refuses to give me head unless I shave it off. Today was no different.

""You okay?"" I asked.

""Uh-huh"" was all Alexis said as she studied my dick.

I laid back down next to her and her eyes continued to roam all over my body.

""Do you have any questions?"" I asked, rubbing my dick in my hand.

""Can I... Can I touch it?"" she asked.

""Of course! It's not like you haven't already."" I joked and removed my hand from my cock.

Alexis timidly moved her hand to my dick and started to crudely play with it. Her eyes were locked on it, refusing to move or look away.

""Is this how I am supposed to do it?"" she asked.

""Do what?""

""Make you cum.""

""Oh, you want to give me a handjob?""

Alexis just nodded her head.

""Here, let me show you."" I said as I pulled her hand off my dick and placed it on my thigh.

I showed her how to stroke my dick. Wrapping my hand around it and sliding it up and down with a slight circular motion once my hand reached the head. Alexis was fascinated watching me jerk off.

Then I pulled my hand back and let Alexis try. The first few strokes were really rough, almost painful. So I stopped her and told her to loosen her grip a little. The next few strokes were nicer. I thought about grabbing the lube on the nightstand and putting some of that on her hand, but I felt a glob of pre-cum form at the tip of my penis and slid down onto Alexis' hand.

She gave my dick a curious look, ""Was that the cum?"" she asked.

I chuckled, ""No, honey. That's just pre-cum. It's like cum, but that's not it.""

""Oh. Okay."" she said, still looking confused.

Watching Alexis stroke my dick, any dick, for the first time was hot. I continued to release pre-cum and the increased lube made her strokes feel better and better. After about 15 minutes or so I could tell I was getting close.

""Okay, Alexis. I'm getting close."" I moaned.

She instantly became nervous and adjusted her position.

""Okay. Uhm. What should I do?"" she asked in a panicked tone.

""You're doing fine. Just keep going and I'm going to cum soon."" I grunted

Alexis nodded her head.

""Just a heads up that it's probably going to shoot pretty far. So try not to get any on your clothes."" I grunted between her strokes.

Alexis shifted herself back, extending her arm out further as she continued stroking my dick.

""Ugh! Here... I... Cum..."" I moaned.

A moment later I began shooting long ropes of cum straight into the air. Alexis, fascinated watching a guy cum for the first time, leaned in close to get a better look and turned my cock towards her right as another spurt of cum escaped from my dick. It landed on her hoodie and she immediately let go of my dick and tried to wipe it off with no success.

I stroked my dick through the rest of my orgasm and Alexis tried to clean the cum off her hoodie. After I finished I collapsed back onto the bed.

""It's okay, Alexis. Don't worry about it.""

""Will it go away?"" she asked.

""Maybe, but it'll probably leave a white mark.""

""Nick, I can't go home with this. My parents would kick me out!"" Alexis exclaimed.

""It's okay, we can put it in the wash and it'll be done before you leave."" I said, reassuring her, ""It's not like you're going to need that much today.""

Alexis giggled and playfully slapped my arm, ""Stop it! I don't want my parents to find out.""

""Why? You're an adult?"" I asked.

""Yeah, but they're super strict. If they knew I was doing this today they would freak out.""

""Really?""

""Mhm. They're like super catholic and want all of us kids to wait until marriage."" she explained.

""So what made you decide to not wait?"" I asked in a curious tone.

""I don't know. I guess I just wanted to know what it was like.""

""Hm. So what do you think so far?"" I asked, trying to gauge her feelings so far.

""It's kinda fun. I like it.""

Alexis cuddled up next to me and we laid there for a while. I think Alexis knew that soon it would be her turn to take off her clothes and I could sense her growing anxiety at the idea. I decided to try to push things further.

""Why don't you take off your clothes and I'll get them in the wash?""

She laid there silently, her anxiety causing her to breathe faster.

""Well, it's just my jacket that needs to be washed."" she said looking down at the cum stain on her hoodie.

""That's true. I can still put it in the wash now if you'd like?""

Alexis hesitated for a moment and then pulled the hoodie up over her head and dropped it on my lap before laying back down, now with just a white t-shirt and sweatpants on.

""Okay... Be right back."" I said as I got up out of the bed with Alexis' hoodie and walked out of the bedroom naked. As I was walking down the stairs to the laundry room I thought about how strange this was to be walking through the house naked with the babysitter up in the guest room, nervously waiting to be fucked.

After I put Alexis' hoodie in the washing machine, I returned to the guest room upstairs where Alexis was waiting. While I was gone she got under the covers. She was now laying on the bed with the covers pulled up past her shoulders. I wondered if she was naked under the covers, so I looked around the room and noticed a pile of clothes on the floor. My cock twitched in the air at the thought of Alexis being naked under the covers.

I walked over to the other side of the bed and grabbed the top of the covers to pull them down, but I stopped myself.

""Want me to get under the covers with you?""

Alexis nodded shyly, and I pulled down the covers, keeping Alexis covered. Then I got into bed and pulled up the covers. I immediately rolled over to wrap my arm around Alexis. I could feel her bare stomach and my cock immediately twitched.

I leaned in to kiss her and we began making out again. My hand started rubbing her flat stomach, but soon I was sliding it up towards her breasts. Just before I reached them I pulled away from our kiss.

""Can I touch them?""

Alexis bit her lower lip and nodded.

My hand gently slid up over Alexis' boob and again my cock twitched. The last time I had felt boobs that weren't Julie's was at my bachelor party. I started to breathe deep with desire. I wanted to jump on top of her and fuck her right then and there.

Feeling her breasts over her hoodie didn't do them justice. Now that I could feel her bare breasts I admired how nice they were. They were a perfect shape, soft yet firm, just big enough to fill your hand. I felt around and found her eraser sized nipples and gave them a gentle squeeze.

""Mmmm..."" Alexis moaned into my mouth.

""Your boobs are so nice."" I whispered into her mouth between kisses.

""Mmmm, I'm glad you like them."" she moaned again as I continued to play with her nipples.

""Can I suck on them?"" I asked.

""My boobs?"" Alexis asked with a concerned face.

""Yeah.""

Alexis froze and bit her lip while she thought about it, then she shook her head no.

""I'd rather not right now.""

""Okay! That's fine, whatever you're comfortable with.""

Alexis sighed in relief, ""Thank you."" she smiled.

I continued to play with her nipples, but I was curious what her pussy felt like.

""Can I touch you down there?"" I asked.

Alexis nodded and I started to slide my hand down her stomach towards her pussy. Soon I could feel some pubic hair on my fingertips and I knew I was close to the promised land. Her entire pubic area was covered in a short patch of hair. The hair even ran down onto her lips. As my hand explored her pubic region I tried to visualize what her pussy looked like. Her lips felt thick and full. I imagined her standing there, two puffy lips between her legs, covered by a patch of public hair.

I decided to see how far she'd let me go, so I took my finger and rubbed it between her lips. Eventually my finger brushed up against her clit and Alexis let out a sharp gasp.

""Oh my god!"" she moaned.

She laid there trying to catch her breath as I continued to explore between her pussy lips. I let my finger brush up against her clit again.

""Oh my god! That feels so good!"" she moaned.

I looked at Alexis who had her head tossed to the side and her eyes closed. I knew what I wanted to do next and I wanted to see the look on Alexis' face when I did it.

I took my finger and pushed it against the opening of her vagina, feeling it slowly give way as it engulfed it. It was very wet and very tight. I wasn't used to having my finger inside such a tight pussy. As my finger entered her, Alexis' eyes shot open with surprise.

She turned her head to look at me, staring right into my eyes.

""Does that feel good?"" I asked her.

All Alexis could do was nod her head.

""God, you're so tight.""

""Uh-huh"" she peeped, as her mouth remained open.

When my finger bottomed out I started to slowly pull it out.

""Ohhhhh"" she moaned as she felt my finger slowly slide out of her pussy.

When just the tip of my finger was left inside her, I pushed back in.

""Oh my god, I feel so full."" she moaned.

I chuckled, ""Well, my dick is a little bit bigger than my finger.""

""Oh my god, I don't know if I can take it. Fuuuuuuck."" she moaned.

It was the first time I had ever heard Alexis curse.

I continued to finger her with my index finger. I would have tried to put a second finger inside her, but she was way too tight and I was afraid of hurting her. I did use my thumb to rub against her clit to provide some additional stimulation.

I could tell Alexis was really getting into me fingering her pussy. She started to buck her hips against my hand.

""God, please don't stop. This feels so good, Nick!"" she moaned.

Suddenly she buried her face into my chest.

""FUCK! I'm going to explode!"" she screamed, ""Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!""

I could feel her pussy convulsing on my finger and her hips started to buck more erratically.

""Damn it, this feels so good!"" she moaned.

I could feel her pussy getting wetter and I figured she was having an orgasm, which might have been her first.

Alexis continued like this for a few minutes before she reached her hand under the covers and grabbed my hand, preventing me from moving it.

""Please stop. I'm really really sensitive down there.""

""Oh yeah?""

""Mhm"" she said, nodding her head that was still pressed against my chest.

""I think you might have just had an orgasm.""

""Mhm... I think so too."" she said, catching her breath.

""Have you ever had one before?""

""I don't think so...""

""Well, I'm honored to have given you your first orgasm."" I kidded.

I slowly removed my finger from her pussy and rested it on top of her pubic area. The two of us laid there while Alexis came down from her orgasm. I was gently stroking her back, admiring her soft skin.

Out of nowhere Alexis said ""Can I try sucking your dick?""

I looked down at her.

""Yeah, absolutely. Today is all about trying new things."" I said, smiling at her.

""So what do I do? Just go down there and suck on it?"" she asked.

""Pretty much...""

Alexis pulled the covers up over her head and slid down the bed. I could feel her straddle my leg as her hairy pussy rested on my leg.",,2025-08-15T18:55:02.439284,3774,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/an-anniversary-threesome,An Anniversary Threesome,Unknown Author,,,,,"""Here's to another 2 amazing years, babe!"" Alex said, raising his glass to meet Julia's across the table. It was a hot summer Friday night in London, and they were drunk on too many cocktails, celebrating their anniversary. He couldn't stop staring at her, for the special occasion she'd worn make-up. Mesmeric feline eyeliner, and subtle pink lipstick that accentuated her top lip. He just wanted to reach over the table and kiss her, and couldn't take his mind off the idea of those lips enveloping his cock like a blooming flower.

She was staring back at him. Into his beautiful green eyes, at his golden Italian summer skin, and strong jaw, framed by the perfect amount of beard. ""God, I just wanted to have a really romantic night, but I just want to rip your clothes off like a wild thing and ride you right here in this bar"", she said, laughing, squeezing his strong bicep, and touching her top lip with her tongue.

""I know babe, I feel the same, it's a bit inappropriate. I keep glancing down at your tits through that top."" It was too hot for bras that night.

""Do you want a sneaky squeeze?"" she asked him, smiling.

""Go on"" he replied, slowly sliding his hand up top, feeling the smooth skin of her waist and moving up to her breast. He felt the weight of it in his hand, quickly feeling her nipple harden. He rolled the nipple between his thumb and forefinger, then moved to massaging her tit in circular movements.

She arched her back and shuddered. ""Fuck. That's my cue for another round I think."" She jumped up and he watched her arse as she approached the bar, rearranging his hard cock.

Julia was waiting for her two margaritas and tequila shots, when someone sat down at the bar next to her, and she felt eyes on her. She turned, and was surprised to see a woman, about 5'6'', dirty blonde hair, are round brown eyes, staring at her through her long eyelashes. ""Hey"", she said, ""I'm Elena.""

Julia gave her name and reached her hand out to meet Elena's.

""Look I don't do this often, I've seen you here before and I think you're fit as hell, and look like fun. Do you want a drink?"" Elena said.

Blushing and flattered, despite her drunkness, Julia replied ""ohhh I'm really sorry. I'm actually here with someone.""

""Oh that's ok babe. No worries... who are you here with?"" Elena replied.

Julia pointed at Alex, in the corner of the bar. ""Wow, he's sexy, isn't he? You lucky bitch,"" Elena laughed.

Still waiting for her drinks, Julia wondered what Alex would say if she brought another woman to the table. They'd never had anyone else entering the relationship, but Elena seemed chill, and was interested in Julia mainly. Maybe she was wasted and acting on impulse, but Julia reached over and touched Elena's arm- ""hey actually, do you wanna join us?""

""Of course"" came the happy reply.

""Make that three tequila shots,"" Julia called to the barman.

Back at the table the two of them set down their drinks, and Alex looked up at the two women in front of him. ""Oh made a friend did you Julia?"" he asked.

Julia introduced Elena, who then said, ""look I don't want to beat around the bush, as it were. I fancy your girlfriend, and you're not so bad either"" she said with a flirty smirk, ""what do you say?""

Alex was shocked. He looked at Julia, who was smiling, and shrugged, raising an eyebrow as if to say, ""why not?""

There were more drinks, a lot more laughing, and a lot more flirting before the trio made the short walk home. Back home, lounging around in the sitting room, low lighting, and the hot summer breeze coming in through the window, things started hotting up quickly.

""So... ""Elena said, running her hand up Julia's bare thigh. Alex, sitting in an armchair opposite watched her hand, and felt a combination of jealousy, and arousal. Part of him wanted to kick her out, to have Julia all to himself, but the other part couldn't help but want these to sexy girls to strip off and enjoy each other's bodies, and his. The second sequence of events is a more accurate description of what happened next.

Elena leant over and kissed Julia, and quickly moved her hand up Julia's skirt. Julia broke the kiss as Elena started rubbing her pussy, and looked over at Alex, for a reassuring smile. She could tell he looked apprehensive, but his delicious hard cock gave away his arousal. Julia reached to touch Elena's pussy, but her denim shorts made things a little difficult.

""Maybe we should... you know"", said Elena. They both knelt on the sofa took off each other's clothes. Soon they were kissing again, Julia's bare tit's pressed up against Elena's in an green underwired bra. Julia guessed her to be at least a 34E, and her bra was giving her unbelievable cleavage. She was shorter and wider than Julia, and her tits matched this description.

Both girls were growing wetter as they touched each other's clits. Julia dipped her finger into Elena's vagina, it felt a lot like her own, when she touched herself. Tight and inviting, like perfectly ripe, juicy mango.

Julia wanted to get Alex involved, who was now stroking his cock watching. Julia got off the sofa, and crawl towards Alex, so her mouth was directly under his cock when she arrived at his feet. She licked his cock, staring up at him. Julia took it deep into her mouth. It throbbed. Soon, Elena had arrived and put her hand on Alex's balls, cupping them as his cock thrust into Julia's open mouth. Julia sucked and licked his cock, and his hands through the hair of both girls kneeling in front of him. His hands then moved simultaneously over both their tits, squeezing them. Saliva ran down Julia's chin, and onto her tits. She was gasping for breath at this point.

""Want to share?"" said Elena. They moved until they were facing each other, Alex's big cock was in between them, at mouth height.

""God my pussy's dripping,"" said Julia. They reached out and felt each other again, both had shaved their pussy lips, apart from a triangle on top, and both were indeed dripping wet.

They leant towards each other as if to kiss, still rubbing each other's clit, lips meeting around Alex's huge cock. He groaned in pleasure as they ran their lips up and down his shaft. After a while, Julia moved to take his balls into her mouth, the way she knew he liked, letting Elena take the lead with the blow job. Then, Julia moved down and started licking Elena's clit, two fingers fucking her, tasting her juices. A little like hers, she thought to herself.

She looked up and saw Alex slide his cock between the other woman's tits, and she felt a little threatened, which turned her on. Elena squeezed her big breasts tight around his cock, and he spat down onto her incredible cleavage a few times, for lubrication, before starting to thrust up into her.

He had two fingers in her mouth and said, ""yeah squeeze those tits, you little slut."" He grabbed her tits and moved her rack up up and down on his cock, pleasuring himself with her body. It felt amazing and looked even better. He looked down at Julia, and nearly erupted seeing her beautiful girl eat another woman's pussy, locking eyes with her as he fucked this other woman's tits.

""Let's change positions"", Alex said. He moved the two girls on their backs, next to each other on the sofa. They were kissing, legs wide open to him. He started with Julia, sliding his cock into her tight wet cunt. It felt amazing, her pussy gripping his cock as he made love to her. He was finger fucking the other girl at the same time, and staring at them kiss, and at the four tits in front of him.

""I'm gonna try out her pussy babe,"" Alex said to Julia.

""Sure, have fun, but come back soon,"" she giggled.

He lined his cock up with Elena's entrance, suddenly amazed at what was happening. ""It's ok babe, it's just a pussy, you officially have my permission"", Julia said to him, smiling, as Elena sucked on her nipples and stroked her clit, waiting for Alex's cock. Reassured, he entered her quickly, and began fucking her pussy, that was about as tight as Julia's, but felt somehow different. Julia felt a twinge of jealousy, but felt her pussy growing ever wetter from the stunning sight of this girl impaled on her boyfriend's cock, his hands all over her huge boobs, playing with her pretty pink nipples.

Elena shouted ""fuck! I'm coming, don't stop, please, please!"" Julia's nipple still in her mouth as she contracted around Alex's cock.

once her orgasm has subsided, he withdrew, bent down to taste her pussy, as she writhed around, in the post orgasm glow.

""I know,"" Alex thought. ""Get on your back, and lick my girlfriend's pussy from below."" Julia moved over her, on all fours, in 69 position. Elena started flicking her tongue over Julia's clit, sending waves of pleasure through her, while Alex moved behind her, rubbing his delicious cock against her ravenous pussy hole.

""Hey babe,"" he said, kissing her back, and caressing her tits. He thought about fucking her perfect cunt, but then thought they could do better.

He dipped his cock into Julia, to wet his dick, then he placed his cock against her ass, and pressed it slowly in. She was so wet, and so aroused, that his cock slid easily in- Julia was yielding herself to him completely. He thrusted in and out of her tight ass, and squeezed her gorgeous round bum cheeks. She was moaning loudly, in ecstasy. Julia came quickly, her pussy juices running down Elena's face below her. Julia's ass contracting around Alex's cock brought him, too, to orgasm, filling her with his hot cum, that had built up over course of the evening. He cried out as his fantastic orgasm overcame him. The trio stayed like that, motionless, before slowly extracting themselves. Alex withdrew slowly.

""That was fun,"" Elena said, gathering up her things, ""I better go, leave the love birds to it."" Julia and Alex laughed.

""Although, if you ever decide to bat for the other side, as it were... well, here's my number"" she said writing it down and handing it to Julia, who was still out of breath from Alex fucking her.

""Thanks"", she said. Elena kissed Julia, and stroked Alex's cheek playfully, before turning to leave and slamming the door.

Julia looked at Alex and they were silent for a while. She crumpled up the number and they burst out laughing. They leant towards each other and kissed gently, sliming. Then, lust overcame them, Julia feeling the need to claim her gorgeous boyfriend for herself all over again. They kissed ferociously, tongues deep in each other's mouth, hands roaming.

""I need you. Are you ready for another go?"" she asked, already straddling him to feel his cock inside her.

""Of course I am"", he said, looking up at her adoringly, cock surging back up to attention, leaning in to feel her beautiful breasts around his face, kissing them.

""Happy anniversary beautiful,"" he said. And with that, she lowered herself slowly, down onto his cock.",,2025-08-15T18:55:39.094621,1931,

Hello! As a pretext, Beltane is a story that crosses into many different fetishes and dynamics. Two staples you can expect pretty much throughout are gentle femdom and cumplay, but also included are cuckqueaning, piss, maledom, f on m cnc, breeding, and a smattering of more mild things like anal, deepthroating, facesitting, and fishnets. There are also some themes of occultism, ritual, and magic that are less overt and more true to life than fantasy. Beltane has been, and is, an exercise in incorporating and moving between these things rather than leaning on just one. If you're looking for any of these things individually in abundance, this may not be your favorite story. But if you're on board for some twists, turns, bodily fluids, and a pagan fucktacular bacchanal across a variety of kinks, well...

Enjoy!

-TheDaggerAndTheCup

*****

This happened my senior year of college. You'll have to pardon me with the exposition, but I was living with a girl, Ann, who I had been seeing for a few years and it was steadily spiraling. And that is important. For later.

I would come home late. I was working sixteen hour days a lot during that time. I had class from 7 AM until three or four, then I would study or work in a lab where I had a job on campus. Then I would ride my bike down the hill from the university to the Copper Mule, a bar and pool hall where I also worked as a bartender. I'd tend bar until 11, sometimes midnight. I'd come home, Ann would be asleep. And I would be as stiff as a fucking rail with no outlet.

Ann, who was never Anna, nor Annalise, was attractive enough. She was 5'6, had brown hair, and was somewhat buxom. Her tits sagged from having been overweight earlier in life. She had a little extra cushion for the pushin', which I didn't mind, but she wore it oddly. She wore sandals and blocky visitor center T-shirts from places she had been. She dressed like a woman in menopause trying to rediscover herself through marijuana and crystals. Outwardly, she had no interest whatsoever in appearing sexy, even when it was just the two of us. I was attracted to her laugh, her sense of humor, and I was convinced she could turn it on when she needed to. Or maybe I just told myself so.

The sex had been decent, if vanilla, in the past. I had on one occasion tied her up and made her come. She liked doing it to me as well, but in a pretty mellow way. She would handcuff me to the bed, blindfold me, and suck my cock. I think she liked watching me writhe. If things had gone differently, she may have developed a femdom streak. Sex was about getting to the orgasm for her though, not the process, the acquisition of it. For her it was simple. She would lie on her back completely still and I would rub her clit. Gently. Slowly. Barely even making contact. The light touch did it every time for her. Then we would fuck. She knew my buttons too. She would whisper in my ear.

""Come inside me. Give it to me. Good, yeah I want you to come inside me.""

And I would. I would pump it deep inside her, feeling her legs lock around me as if she knew I was caught in her web. But almost always sooner than I would have liked, and with no real hurrah. But that didn't matter to her, we had both gotten to the objective, the ""finish line"". That was our ritual.

I wanted more. I would try to initiate, and she would often deny me. She would get high and lounge around in her frumpy pajamas watching Friends. Being frumpy. Being boring. If my hands started to venture over her body she would say she just wanted to cuddle. And then I would be stuck in the monotony of her world, perfectly sufficient for her, but absolutely maddening to me. This would carry on for days, weeks at a time until she knew that I couldn't take it, and then she would ask me to make her come. Going through the motions. Orgasm. Completing the ritual of satisfaction. And slowly, the frustration was building in me. I felt trapped. I had so much energy, despite the long hours. I wanted to fuck. To pull hair, to beg and be begged for. And I knew that if it wasn't her, there was someone who would gladly sign up. Look, I'm not a supermodel but I've always done fairly well for myself with sexual partners. I'm tall- 6'4, lean and toned, brown hair, green eyes, with a hairy chest and stomach. My cock isn't the biggest but it's never let me down, at just a shade under 8"" long (and cut, for the sake of the visual). And it was aching for more.

I admit I didn't always act right. I would pick fights and blow things out of proportion. Maybe I was looking for a way out. But I was just so pent up. Coming home, 11 o' clock and dreaming that on the other side of my front door she'd be waiting for me, presenting her pussy for me to taste and fuck. Just once. But no. It was always a dark house and my erection pressing through my pants. Knowing if I tried to roll her over she would be offended, then mad. And then she would deny me even longer. This was the cycle of it. Her allowing me to blow off just enough steam to be able to say she was taking care of my needs. And me festering.

So I said fuck it. I sat on the couch, plugged my headphones into my phone, and dove into the old spank bank. This was a tiny apartment, but I was confident that she was out cold and regardless it was the only time I had to myself. I had to try. So I pulled up some porn and got my prick out and started stroking. I was watching things that I could only fantasize about doing in my real relationship. Women being tied up, fucked in the ass, and begging to cum. Begging. I was masturbating to the freedom of BDSM. Coveting with my whole heart. And throbbing. Rubbing myself with my own precum, the slightest lubrication almost sending me over the edge, and holding on for just another minute. Knowing that I would cover myself in hot ropes of cum the moment I let go, knowing I would have to clean it up, knowing I would have to sneak into bed and pretend I was content to hold what was rapidly becoming a hollow relationship together. And then I saw something move out of the corner of my eye.

She was standing at the end of the hallway looking into the living room at me. I startled and ripped my headphones out of my ears.

""What are you doing?"" she asked.

""I, uh, I'm...""

""Oh my god, I didn't realize-"" she began to realize what was happening as I lowered my phone, to illuminate my member. She hurried back down the hall to the bedroom. I could hear her crying. And just like that it was over. I was soft and I felt guilty. I'm not even sure why. In that moment it was over for me. I couldn't even masturbate in my own home. But I had to act as a cleanup crew and pull this person back together. To tell her that there was nothing wrong. Because somehow that was the only answer she would take. As if in trying to have an orgasm for myself I was hurting her. This was part of the cycle too. The guilt. To keep it going. And so I went to comfort and reassure her.

Several weeks went by and it ended, I won't trouble you with how exactly but let's say it was similar to the masturbation event. Lots of crying. The semester was coming to an end, this being the spring. It ended on Easter, which seemed like a good sign. She started staying at a friend's, coming back occasionally to feed her cat or pick up things she needed. She was an emotional wreck. The screaming and crying, my god. But mostly the guilt. She ladled it on thickly. How she had tried and tried to do everything she could and I was a selfish piece of shit, blah blah blah. I was over it. Completely disconnected. After six months strong of neglect I just didn't have any feelings left to offer. I had been exhausted to the point that caring about it was too much work. I downloaded tinder and got ready to put my cock to work after a winter in hibernation.

I was closing up the back bar at the Copper Mule after work one night whistling a tune while sweeping around the pool tables and thinking about what I would do with a nice slut. Oh, I mused, if only I had a nice slut. Someone eager to please. I hung my dry mop up and locked the door to the back bar, my prick at a quarter mast as I ambled up to the front bar for my nightly shift beer. I spied a pretty bleached blonde girl at the end of the bar on her own and decided to sit a few stools down, where I could maybe sneak a peek at her cleavage. I wasn't confident I would be able to go home with her or even start a conversation, but in my state I just couldn't resist being close to a pretty thing like her. She was small, maybe 5'4, about a full foot shorter than me, but had nice round B or C cup tits and as I walked past to sit at the bar I noticed her ass and thighs were deliciously thick. Her lip was pierced, she had some visible tattoos peering out from under her sleeves, and black nail polish. Her shirt was low cut and I immediately got the cleavage I had been after. It was clear that she was not wearing a bra and her nipples showed through her shirt somewhat. They were pierced too. She had the immediate air of familiarity about her, but I couldn't place it. She was looking at her phone and hadn't noticed me sit down. I ordered a beer and sat back, watching whatever was on TV. My hand gravitated to my phone and I reflexively checked Tinder for the eighth time that day. There were a few new matches after my last bombardment of right swipes, but as I flipped through I noticed one in particular that stood out. It was the girl sitting at the bar next to me. Matched 6 minutes ago. She had swiped on me after I had sat down.

Needless to say my cock nearly broke my zipper. I tried to stay casual, viewing her profile. Her name was Gemma. There were a few pictures, the last of which featured her in fishnet stockings, which I loved, but Ann would never grant me the pleasure of seeing her in. Her bio read:

""Be a

Darling and

Send me a

Message, won't you?

Horror movies and chill. I'll let you make me breakfast in the morning. ""

It was thinly veiled and even a little cliche but the thought that I had a shot with an actual kinky girl had me completely erect under the bar. I leaned forward to hide it. Before I had a chance to decide my next move I got a notification. It was a message from her.

""You come here often?""

I smiled. So she was funny and forward. The jig was up. My cover was blown. I was going to have a conversation with this person whether I was ready or not. I looked up to find her already looking at me. She had dark brown eyes with little flecks of yellow in them. I chuckled and took a drink, bracing myself.

""I work here actually, and I was about to ask you the same thing.""

""Is that so? You weren't just going to ogle my profile and then go home?""

""Well, I wasn't planning on it. I didn't have a plan really, just sort of hoping for the best. Should I have hit you with a pickup line? You don't look receptive to that kind of thing.""

She smiled coyly. ""No, I think that would have been game over for you. I'm kinda picky. It was just too perfect, you sitting down right as I was admiring your profile.""

Oh shit. Oh shit oh shit. You can close this

, I thought.

She's throwing you total 'do me' vibes. Just keep it together

.

""I'm James,"" I offered, extending my hand.

She smiled again and took it. ""Gemma. But you already knew that. Are you newly single or something?""

She already had me figured out. ""Wh- why would you say that?""

""You just generally don't shake hands with someone on a tinder date.""

DATE!?

I thought. ""You just seem like you're kinda rusty.""

""Wow, you're actually spot on. How do you do that? Yeah I just got out of a long relationship, it's a total mess but I'm glad to be done. I just needed to get out of there.""

She laughed. ""I knew it. I'm a witch is how. Just looking for able bodies to sacrifice, you know.""

I laughed. ""Where do I sign? I'm able enough.""

""We'll see about that. Let's finish up our interview first.""

""Oh, so first it's a date, and now it's an interview?"" I laughed again, taking a sizable drink of my beer. I was treading water. ""That seems like a downgrade.""

""It's whatever you want it to be,"" she replied, locking eyes with me in a sudden intensity. We hung there for a second. Then she laughed and I realized she was teasing me. I felt like all my cards were showing. Could she see my erection?

Please god tell me she can't see my erection.

""No, 'interview' is much better. Remember, I'm looking for victims here.""

""Well by all means then,"" I stood up and gestured to a nearby table, ""should we move to a more professional setting?""

She smiled. ""Of course.""

She slid down from the barstool she'd been at, took her drink and her jacket, and sauntered ahead of me. She was wearing skintight leggings and for the first time I got a look at her magnificent ass. There was a small gap between her pants and the hem of her shirt and I could see her dimples of Venus. I watched her ass jiggle the whole way as she led me across the room to a small table against the wall and away from people.

""So, lover boy,"" she said as we sat, ""what are you looking for?""

""I mean, do you want me to be real about it?""

I'd like to see if you can squirt.

""Please. Lay it on me.""

I want to find out if you can deepthroat.

""Well I just got out of a long thing, like I said, and to be honest it was brutal.""

I wonder if you like getting fucked in the ass.

""I just need to get back in the game.""

I bet you like it rough.

""Meet some new people, try some new things.""

I wonder if I'd suffocate if you sat on my face.

She nodded. ""What was so brutal about it?""

""It was just all about her. She didn't care about what I needed or wanted. I don't really want to get into it.""

""You poor thing. Did she not cup the balls?""

I laughed. She had never once cupped the balls. ""No, she didn't. It's more than that though. I just want to try new stuff and she's kind of.....""

""Vanilla?""

""I was going to say boring.""

""Ouch.""

""Honestly I just don't fucking care any more. I put up with it for so long. I couldn't even masturbate in my own home. I'm just so over-""

She grabbed my hand and held onto it. ""I hear you. You have a right to be mad. You need what you need. If your partner can't satisfy your needs they have an obligation to allow you to seek release elsewhere.""

""Is that from something? It sounds like you're quoting something.""

She laughed again. ""Maybe, don't worry about it. So now you have to tell me what you're into.""

""What do you mean?"" She was still holding my hand in both of hers.

""What is it that she wouldn't do for you?""

""Oh that. I mean, anything really. I tied her up once, she tied me up a few times, and-""

She cut me off. ""Did you like it?""

""Like what?""

""When she tied you up. Did you like it?""

""Uh, well. Yeah, I did. I think I'm a switch. I'm usually on top but I like when a girl knows how to take control too.""

Her eyes brightened. ""Did she ever play with your ass?""

I was surprised. ""No, definitely not. I don't think I'd like that. We didn't really do anything beyond some basic bondage. It was pretty lame.""

She looked as if she was restraining herself. ""You haven't asked about me yet,"" she invited.

We talked on and drank on. With more social lubricant we got deeper into our fetishes. She was also a switch, but we both considered ourselves more dominant than submissive. There was clearly a lot she was into, and the more I asked the more she confirmed that notion without clarifying a whole lot. It felt like she was saving it for later. I had hovered in and out of a throbbing erection the entire time. We ordered more and more drinks, and before long we were both good and buzzed. And then it was one in the morning. The bartender yelled for last call.

""So how am I doing?"" I asked, laughing at a dirty joke she had told.

""In the interview?"" I nodded. ""You're hired, lover boy.""

I laughed on. ""Well maybe we should meet up again soon.""

She leaned back and looked at me over the rim of her glass. ""Or you could take me home and fuck me.""

I considered my living situation. I didn't know if Ann would be around, but I doubted it. I hadn't seen her in a week. ""That,"" I said, touching her leg, ""is a tempting offer.""

""Do you live far from here?""

""A block and a half.""

""Are there any good alleyways on the way?""

""What!?""

She laughed. ""Come on, take me home. Unless you're afraid I'll bite.""

She had given me an out. It was courteous. I was a little nervous about having sex with a new partner for the first time in two years, but I didn't have any real reservations. This girl was the whole package as far as I was concerned in the moment.

I stood up. ""Come with me, little lady.""

I led her out the door. She put on her leather jacket and we took off through the warming April air. We walked through a block, across a wide parking lot.

""Hey, wait,"" she said as we passed a parked van.

""What? You gonna throw me in here?""

She pushed me up against the side of it, hard, and kissed me. Thrusting her tongue into my mouth. I grabbed her ass. She grabbed my cock. I was terrified and aroused all at the same time. After so much time not being touched she had me as stiff as a diamond. I could feel a bead of precum on the tip of my cock. Her forwardness was hard to take in all at once.

""Mm. Big boy,"" she whispered in my ear. She had started unzipping my fly. ""You want to cum on my face? Should we go say hi to your ex?""

I closed my eyes, breathing heavily. She was brushing up against my cock through my underwear and I was twitching with excitement. Suddenly the thought of fucking her on the living room floor while Ann watched us shot into my head. Gemma moaning and coming like I knew she would while Ann got a good taste of how much better than her I could do. I snapped out of it, opening my eyes and grabbing Gemma by the waist. I picked her up, turned her around, and slammed her into the wall of the van. Her legs wrapped around me, pulling my cock against her slit. I bit her lip and pulled, rubbing my cock against where I approximated her clit to be. She sighed breathily.

""You're gonna look cute with my cock down your throat. Be a good girl and follow me home now."" I had no idea where this was coming from. I had never talked to anyone that way, nor been talked to that way. I guess after such a long time without a good fuck I really did have some pent up energy. I had always

wanted

to talk to someone that way, but it had always seemed dirty and wrong. But not now. Now I was free.

I set her down suddenly and walked off, wanting to tease her back. I pushed my underwear and dick back into my pants and zipped up. I heard Gemma call for me to wait somewhere behind me. I rounded a corner and saw my apartment window. There was a light on inside.

She must have left a lamp on,

I thought and continued. Gemma caught up and I grabbed a big handful of her ass.

We finished the walk and stumbled drunk up the stairs to the door. As I fumbled for my keys Gemma got down on her knees and began unbuckling my belt. She had my button undone and my zipper down and she was about to pull my cock out right then and there when we heard something behind us. It was Ann, standing frozen at the top of the stairs. I wasn't sure what to do. Dumb fucking Ann in her stupid bad t shirt who had bullied me into thinking my wants didn't matter and then made me feel guilty for it. Who had guilted me into a whole relationship. Who had turned love into pity long after the respect was gone. Who had never once so much as cupped my fucking balls. Suddenly I was overcome with lust. I wanted her to know what it looked like when a real woman sucked cock. I looked down at Gemma. She was smiling naughtily. I pulled my dick out and her expression changed to a mixture of shock and joy. She wanted it. I felt amazing. She opened her mouth and I stuck it in, facefucking her. I could hear her moaning through the wet sloshing of my cock as I rammed it further and further into her mouth. I looked past my prick. She had her hand in her tights. She was rubbing her pussy. I looked over my shoulder at Ann, beet red in the face. Not crying. Not leaving either. Just embarrassed beyond belief.",,2025-08-15T18:55:45.487452,3907,
https://www.literotica.com/s/gabys-cuckquean-adventure-pt-02,Gaby's Cuckquean Adventure Pt. 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"Hi, I'm back! If you don't know who I am, you should probably read Part 1 for context!

In Part 2 I will go a small step further and introduce you to some of my friends, all of them come with certain benefits, but let me know who of the girls YOU like the most (I guess I'm one of them as well, but don't be biased!). Have fun!

--

We didn't speak too much about that night for the next few days, Damien clearly didn't want to make me uncomfortable and I wasn't 100% sure how much he actually enjoyed it, until around a week later, where I finally found some courage. We were once again relaxing on our couch, cuddled up in a big ball, as I started to ask:

""Did you enjoy our play session last week?""

""Which one?"" He asked with a grin.

""You know, the one where you watched some porn!"" He was such a tease, I'm pretty sure he knew exactly what I meant.

""Oh! Yeah that was new, but definitely fun, I just didn't really know what you got out of it or how I could make it better for you..."" Do you hear this man? Perfection.

""You already tried a bit of degrading, you noticed how hard I came from that!""

""Yeah, that was wild, I'm just happy to see you happy! And if being a little rough achieves that... why not?""

""So... Do you want to try it again?"" I put on the cutest face I could make.

""What? Like right now?""

""Yeah..."" I gently slid my hand on his crotch. It didn't take as much convincing this time. That boy was already getting horny while I rubbed him through his jeans.

""Sooo more porn?"" he asked.

""No baby, this time I had something different in mind."" I pulled out my phone and clicked on a special folder I had prepared in the last few days. In there were some of my friends in more revealing photos. Mostly taken from Instagram or fit pics they had sent me, so nothing NSFW, but I still hoped the taboo nature would be enough for him. I handed him the phone.

""What's that? Is that Emma?""

""Yes babe, I thought you maybe wanted to look at my hot friends while I gave you a blowjob?"" I blinked my eyes at him like that was a normal question to ask your boyfriend.

""Phew, that's a little weird without their consent, but you do have some attractive friends, I can't deny that!""

Of course he now brought consent up! Even caring for my friends while I offered to blow him once again. ""Babe, I can guarantee you everyone in there finds you hot, they all would probably be happy if I told them about this."" Okay, I couldn't know that for sure, but I was pretty certain. Damien was my number one topic with pretty much all of my friends and almost all of them found him amazing and charming to be around. He tagged along to hang out with them when I asked him to, he stayed at home when I wanted to spend some alone time with them, which was most of the time just me bragging about him. And like I said, he was attractive and multiple of my friends agreed with me on that.

Back to the situation at hand! I already started to rub his big dick through his pants again. ""So yes, Emma, Clara are in there oh and of course Luna as well!"" His ears literally perked up as I said that, I knew how to get my man. Don't worry we'll talk plenty about these lovely ladies. ""But leave Luna for the finale, let's start with Emma, they are in order!"" I said as I pulled his pants down.

Maybe I should take a quick break here and actually tell you about the three lovely ladies I'm about to jerk my boyfriend to:

Emma is one of my best friends... period. To this day I don't know how, or why she's friends with me because she's literally perfection incarnate. She always loved sports and was the absolute ace of our highschool cheer squad and continued that passion into university. She's now doing a sports major and has worked herself all the way up to be the cheer captain of the local university. She's naturally blonde, and usually wears her hair in a long ponytail. She is 5'9"" without an ounce of fat in her perfectly attractive body, she's the kind of athlete you'd see at olympia and think 'Damn, her husband has to be the luckiest guy on the planet.' To accompany she has perky C-tits (I've seen them plenty in the shower), the most perfect ass on the planet (all her training pays off) and what makes her stand out a lot: she just knows how to present herself. Her sense of fashion and make-up skills leave her looking flawless every day, she's a literal idol at our university and just the best friend you could imagine.

Clara is... an interesting one. She's a rather petite brunette, around 5'4"" with a tanned body. She has rather small A-cups, but tries to make up for it with her butt and adoring pig tails. Apart from being a huge nerd for bizarre games, she's also like really kinky and openly sexual. I once walked in on her with a creampie still flowing down her thigh and she wasn't embarrassed at all. Clara calls her tails 'love handles' and will tell you about a million sex stories when you ask her. So she'd definitely be into this.

Last, but (as you could've guessed from Damien's reaction) definitely not least is Luna. Luna is a goth goddess. She has huge D-cups, is around 5'8"", super pale with tattoos contrasting her skin. Her hair is usually dyed black with a single colorful streak. I love Damien and I fully trust him, but I know how much Luna is his type. He is allowed to look, but still always does it with the utmost respect. I think she's probably my ultimate trump card in my big plan, with a chance to fuck her on the line, he'd probably be more inclined to go on this adventure with me.

Where was I? Oh, of course! I was stroking my boyfriend's gorgeous dick slowly up and down while he looked at my perfect cheerleading best friend. His eyes were fixed on a picture of her in her uniform, a short skirt and a sporty crop top that showed her toned abs. I could see his eyes leaving the screen less than the last time as he scrolled through my selection. I made sure to put some bikini pictures in there as well, and because Emma was so popular among boys, her Instagram feed was filled with a few 'thirst traps' making sure to keep their attention. She was bending over in one, showing off her sporty ass. Licking an ice cream cone seductively in another. And Damien was a creative guy, I'm sure my boyfriend could imagine her licking his big dick instead. To fuel his fantasy I did just that and slowly started to lick along his shaft. He looked at me with a loving smile and gave an approving nod, as I stopped to tell him to keep his focus on the phone he suddenly asked:

""Did I tell you to stop?"" I was taken aback, of course he didn't! He probably enjoyed my tongue on his dick and I just stopped for no good reason! The submissive in me was grinning happily at his question.

""Oh... no, sorry, I just wanted to tell you to focus less on me, should I continue?""

""Yes, and give a little more love to my balls."" I did just that and let his cock slide against my cheek until I was all the way at his balls. His manly scent was even stronger there as I kissed and licked away at them. I seldomly did that, but couldn't tell you why, it felt really fun. Okay it also felt really good that it was a 'request' from him, not an order yet, but still super sexy.

As I was basically worshiping his balls, he scrolled and exclaimed: 'Oh that's Clara! If I didn't know any better I'd say she put you up to this."" Damien knew what kind of girl Clara was, she also told all her stories around him.

""Do you remember the one time she told us about her toy collection?"" Of course I did, she was quite tipsy at a party and spilled her beans that she had gotten into HUGE dildos. ""Didn't she also mention that she trained deep-throating with them?"" My pussy was getting wetter as I anticipated where this was going. ""I bet with all that practice she gives amazing blowjobs. Think you can keep up?""

Has this perfect man read about submissives and cuckqueans in the last few days? Of course I could keep up. Faster than ever before I darted back from his balls and took his cock into my mouth starting a thorough blowjob. Listen. I know how to give head. My tongue swirled around his tip, I made sure to use plenty of suction and take him as far down as I could. This was one of my main weak spots. I couldn't deepthroat him as far as I would like. I bobbed my head up and down on his cock, using plenty of spit to lube it up properly. Damien groaned appreciatively while he continued to look at Clara. I have actual nudes from her, but I didn't include them to leave all the girls at the same playing field.

""Her pigtails do look kind of nice and I never noticed her cute face..."" He continued as I tried to impress him with my blowjob skills. Suddenly his eyes shifted back to me, fighting for my life to take a bit of him down my throat.

""I think it's cute how you're trying to compete. Do you think Clara would struggle this much?"" Fuck! I felt my juices running down and building a puddle between my legs. Of course she wouldn't. I tried extra hard and took him deep once again. I felt my pesky gag reflex complaining, but pushed through and managed to take his tip into my throat for the first time. That tickled another moan out of Damien. ""Mmmmmh, that feels good, but I bet her mouth feels even better, having such a tight throat all around my cock..."" I tried to impress him once again, but his man-rod simply was too big, I coughed and had to go up for air. In a pretty unsexy display I sat before him and caught my breath, which of course broke my gentle boyfriend out of character again.

""Hey, are you alright?"" He almost dropped my phone as he reached down to care for me.

""No, no I'm fine, you're just really big. And all your talk is really sexy..."" I said, catching my breath again. ""But since I'm afraid I really can't compete with Clara, how about you fuck me instead.""

Damien gave me a gentle kiss on the forehead and helped me lie down on the couch, in a classic missionary position, but I noticed one thing! My phone was missing and he hadn't even gotten to the best parts yet! ""Babe, what about the phone! Please keep looking at them while you fuck me!""

""Gabs... I'd love to but I'm pretty sure I can't scroll through a phone while I pound you, that's a little too much coordination for me."" What a cutie, luckily I had the perfect solution!

""Ah, don't worry about that!"" I grabbed my phone and held it right above my face, of course facing him and not me, so he could look at the pictures. ""Does that solution work for you? This way you can imagine fucking them instead of me.""

He was stunned for a little moment, and I already felt a monologue about how much he loves to look at me during sex coming up so I simply scrolled over to show him that the Clara pictures were done and Luna was next up. Her first pick was taken below her, she wore a sultry smile while she raised the black skirt she was wearing a little, her big boots and nylons probably just helped the case. Or I can only guess, but I felt my boyfriend's dick finally parting my needy cunt. It was so wet that he literally just slipped in and could go full pace, it seems I had worked him up quite a bit.

While that was a good sign I now had to focus on both holding the phone steady, scrolling at times and also the pleasure coming from my core. I was moaning and shaking under his heavy thrusts, which made the whole phone thing a bit hard. I don't know if Damien was in his own Luna world or felt really good, but I heard nothing but (very sexy) grunts from him for a while. Some encouragement was needed. ""Do you like what you see babe?""

""Fuck, yes, I'm sorry she's just really sexy.""

""AwwaaaAAH, don't be sorry babe! Fuck my pussy while you look at her, tell Luna how good she looks.""

""Fuck! Luna, you're really hot and you feel really good."" I felt the familiar feeling of an orgasm approaching. Time for more play acting! I tried to put on a slightly different voice, which is incredibly hard while you're getting hammered by the way.

""Oh? Do I baby? Does my goth pussy feel better than the one of your girlfriend?"" Luckily my stud understood the cue.

""Fuck yes, so much, I wish I could fuck you all the time!"" That paired with the really got sex did it for me. I howled into our room as I had a big orgasm, through which my boyfriend just continued fucking me, prolonging it for a good minute until I scrolled for the last time.

I kind of forgot I put that in there. But he was now looking at a picture of a top- and braless Luna. She was holding her breasts with one arm, thus hiding the nipples, but you still had a good view of her perfect pair of tits. Her expression was kind of cutesy or begging with the caption: ""They're so heavy, can you hold them for me?""

""OH. MY. GOD!"" My boyfriend let out a huge moan as he came inside my pussy, mixing his creamy load with my overflowing juices. While I failed my initial mission of just sucking him off, that creampie felt absolutely amazing. Exhausted I let my arms drop and he leaned down for a deep, romantic kiss.

Still inside me he said. ""I love you, you know that? That was all just fun and acting. Did you like it?""

I gave a small chuckle. ""What do you think big boy? Of course I loved it. Just like you!""

After cleaning myself up, we went back to being a big cuddly ball and I think we wanted to continue to watch our movie, but I wouldn't remember, since I drifted asleep on his comfy chest within seconds.",,2025-08-15T18:55:52.240892,2569,

Chapter 2

*****

""Iga! Get down here, I need you!"" I shout into the voicepipe. An odd fixture to be sure, but it's an old house. They crisscross too many rooms, but I always keep the one in the lab open to Iga's room. I suppose I could just use the phone, but I appreciate the direct simplicity.

I get back to work on arranging my electrodes until she arrives. I know it's late, but when I get focused and make progress, I'm like a hummingbird and can't slow down.

She finally stumbles into the lab, buttoning her shirt as she enters. Her hair is a mess, and a sheen of sweat is across her brow.

""I didn't wake you, did I?"" I ask. I'm sure I did, but it's worth it.

""Oh, no, wide awake. I was just in the middle of-"" she clears her throat, ""What did you need me for, Victoria?""""

I just grin and flip the switch. All at once, the body, or rather, the amalgamation of bodies, rises, and takes a step forward, and then another. The wires trail behind it, but it maintains it's balance.

Iga's eyes fly wide, ""It's... walking!"" she smiles at me and we both jump like excited little girls.

She walks up to the triumph of science, and it looms over her, naked and in excellent proportions. Not that it's excessively tall, but Iga is rather petite.

""Wow, can it-"" Iga's words are cut short as the monster, if we'll call it that, takes another step and the taut wires pull it off balance. It tumbles forward, on top of her, burying her face in it's ample breasts.

I gasp and rush forward to pull it off of her. I forget to turn the power off and it's attempts to walk forward only result in it grinding it's chest into her face over and over as she tries to fight it off. I realize 'world's first involuntary zombie motorboating' isn't something typical to think of as an accomplishment, but I can't help but appreciate the novelty.

We finally pull the monster free, and I power it down. We both laugh as we relax. Well, mostly I laugh.

""So how much can it do, now?"" she asks as we put the body back on the slab.

""Not a lot just yet. Just basic motor functions,"" I explain, ""But the body itself is in good shape. Just look at it. No signs of decay or rigor mortis. If it wasn't for the stitch marks, you'd never know it had been dead tissue just a few hours ago.""

""Do you still think we can initiate higher functions of the brain?"" she asks.

""I still need to do more tests, but I see no reason why not, at this point. I don't know if it'll be completely intact, we may not keep things like memories, but considering the experimental nature, that may be fore the best. The problem is finding the right one, but I'm onto something that might be promising.""

""Oh? Do tell,"" she says as we roll the body back into the freezer.

""A women's chess champion died the other day, drowned in a hot tub. If the damage to the brain is minimal, it might be the perfect opportunity,"" I realize how ghoulish it all sounds when I say it out loud, but I'm too excited to care, ""If I'm correct, she'll be at a morgue just over state lines.""

""Thinking of making another little trip?"" Iga snickers, ""Should we make sure to bring Eli?""

""Of course, we need all the help we-"" I pause, ""Oh, you mean because of that awful woman. Ha. Ha. Seriously, there's no way there's any other weird perverts running morgues like that. We just need to be more careful this time.""

""Why do you want to make this perfect woman of yours? Don't you worry that if it works, she'll wake up and steal your boyfriend?"" Iga teases.

""Nonsense. My poor little Iga, don't you know anything about boys?"" I pat her on the head, ""What they truly appreciate is brilliance, and this will be a display of that. Being physically sexy is one thing, but having the genius to create that is another! If anything, it's Eli that'll worry about men taking an interest in me after I show the world our discoveries. Not that I have eyes for anyone else.""

She snickers at me again, ""If you say so.""

""Where is Eli, by the way, have you seen him?"" I ask, pulling my gloves off.

""Yeah, he's up in my-"" she coughs a little, ""I saw him in the hallway outside my room as I was coming down.""

""Great. I need to share my excitement with him,"" I grin, meaning exactly what it sounds like.

""I'm sure he's all prepared to hear about your discoveries,"" Iga says in a sly tone.

""What makes you say that?"" I tilt my head to the side.

""Nothing! Just I'm sure he'd like to share your excitement,"" she laughs a little.

I shrug as I hang up my lab coat, ""By the way, have you heard any weird noises coming from the voicepipes? Scratching, rustling, thumping, a weird one that sounds like heavy breathing? I think we might have rats.""

""Old house, old tubes, probably just some loose joints,"" she assures me.

--

""Heeey sweetie,"" I say as I slide into bed and curl my arms around Eli, having found him lying on his side, reading. I walk my fingers from one hand up his bare chest like little spiders.

""Did you wash your hands?"" he asks, rather unromantically, without looking from his book.

""Is that any way for a man to greet the woman he loves?"" I poke my finger on his chin.

""For most men, no,"" he claps the book shut, ""But most men don't have women who are downstairs crossing lines that humans weren't meant to cross.""

I ignore him and try to slide my hand under the sheets like a mischievous child. A hand which he quickly grabs by the wrist, then wags a finger at me with his other hand.

""You know my rule. No D for you, until you've cleaned up properly,"" he boops me on the nose to emphasize his point.

I groan and slide out of bed and walk to the bathroom, ""You're so uptight!""

""Oh, yes,"" I hear him from the bedroom as I soap up my hands, ""I'm uptight because I don't want any horrible corpse pathogens crawling on my gentials.""

I make sure to wash up to the elbow to appease his hygienic demands. I walk out and display the front and back of my hands for his inspection. He gives an approving nod and I immediately pull my shirt off, over my head, and quickly shimmy out of my pants, working out of my undergarments as I slide under the covers.

I cuddle up next to him and give him a quick little kiss, then curiously rub my fingers over the top of his chest, ""You're a little sweaty, are you okay?""

""Hm?"" he seems a little surprised, ""Oh, no, I'm fine?""

""Now that I think of it, Iga was a bit sweaty looking when she came down. Is it too warm up here?"" I ask, worried for my baby's comfort, ""The heater could be acting up again.""

""No, it's fine,"" he laughs a little, ""I can't speak for Iga, but I guess I was just thinking of you,"" he gives me a little wink.

""Aww, that's the cheesiest, stupidest crap ever. I love you,"" I nuzzle up against his shoulder.

""Mmm... you actually smell really good tonight, baby. Not sure what it is, maybe i just like your sweaty smell,"" I nibble a little at his shoulder.

""Got me, I, uh, don't think I've done anything to make myself smell better. I'm surprised you can smell anything after being around all the chemicals down there, "" he leans down and kisses me, ""So what was the big breakthrough down in the lab?""

""I got it to, uh..."" I bite my lip, ""It can wait, can't talk with my mouth full.""

I dive under the covers like a cat and grab his cock like it's going to get away.

""Wait, Victoria, maybe you should let me shower first,"" he protests a little and acts like he's going to escape my love.

""Ot a hance mffter,"" I say, or try to say as I feel him swell up in my mouth. He quickly stops and relents to me. Fellatio is the the ultimate negotiator.

His skin is a bit moist down here, too. And smells even better. And the taste... unf. I mean, I know I'm a pervert, so that his musk is making me drenched isn't that weird. But I'm also a scientist, and it's driving me nuts that I can't put my finger on what that great smell is in particular, and why it has such a great effect on me.

I throw in all my skills and knowledge of anatomy. I give him good suction, swirl around the head, make sure I get the underside. I get him hard as a rock and writhing around in no time at all. He tries to hold back his moans, but I give my everything so that he can't. I take him as deep as I can. Still not deep enough, but I'll get there some time.

His fingers run through my hair, and then tightly grab a handful and pull me back, letting me know he wants to take over. I rise up and leave myself at his whims as he forcefully turns my body around and throws me down on the mattress. He lifts my hips up, but leaves my chest down, so that my ass is presented to him, with my pussy exposed to him.

I take a deep breath and clutch the sheets, preparing myself, only to feel the gentle rubbing of his cock's head against my entrance. I try to back my hips up, but he holds me in place.

""You're so mean!"" I whine as he rubs against my clit.

""Wow, you really do want it, huh? Dripping all over the place,"" he teases, before finally pushing in, slowly.

I moan out and pull at the sheets as he fills me up a bit at a time, then starts thrusting in and out, pleasuring his cock inside of me. My hands snake down below me and reach between my legs, but are quickly grabbed by the wrists and pulled away.

""So. Mean,"" I whine again, even more pathetically, ""Lemme touch it.""

""I don't know,"" he says, between grunts as he penetrates me, ""Do naughty little scientists who can't respect the natural order of the world get to play with their clits? Do girls who make unnatural abominations that transgress ethical boundaries get to cum?""

Fuck. I love when he gets wordy with his teasing, ""Y-yes. Sure they do. Please. Let me... Please!""

""Oh, I don't think they do,"" he leans forward, to speak right into my ear as he ravishes me.

I just whine and whimper in response. Just fucking can get me so close, but I need that little extra.

""You'll have to admit it,"" he says, ""Maybe I'll make an exception.""

""I'm... I'm sorry. I'm a dirty, wicked scientist... I... I make horrible abominations,"" he forces a long moan out of me, ""Please let me cum... I'll be ethical, I promise!""

He snickers, ""That's good... but not quite enough. Tell me about the dream again.""

""No!"" I shout in protest, ""Please don't, it's embarrassing!""

""That's fine, I'm almost there. When I finish, we can just stop,"" he picks up the pace. My insides are on fire.

""I... I was sitting... on the foot of the bed, and you were..."" I struggle to get the words out.

""What was I doing?""

""You were... were fucking another woman... right... right in front of me,"" it's hard enough to tell when I'm not having a cock slammed up into me.

""Go on,"" he says.

""And I asked you... asked you stop, but you wouldn't.""

""And why's that?"" he grins, nibbling at my shoulder.

""You said it was... too good... it was better,"" I mumble out.

""And then?""

""And then you came in her... and she came over to me... and she ordered me to lick her clean..."" I gasp out.

""Keep going.""

""I said I wouldn't, but-"" I jump as he slaps my ass to correct me. It makes my pussy clench, and I can tell he enjoys it.

""Tell it write, Victoria.""

""...I ...I don't say anything... I dive right in..."" it's hard to get such an embarrassing story out, ""I suck your cum out of her... every drop.""

His hands slide under me and toy with my nipples, ""And what did she say at the end?""

""That..."" I swallow hard, ""That I was a good girl.""

Teeth gentle press against my earlobe, ""And how did that make you feel?""

""V... very happy. I felt proud,"" I cry out, in between moans.

I can feel him smiling as he nuzzles against me from behind. He loves making me tell him this, he loves teasing me with it. Shouldn't have told him about the dream in the first place.

But then come those words, ""That's my good girl.""

He grasps my wrists and brings them between my legs, pressing my fingers to my own clit, fingering me with my own hands. I'm already so close.""

""You can cum for me,"" he whispers as his hips pound hard at me, and I feel his cock throb. I know I don't have much time as I feel him explode into me, flooding my body with his seed.

I work my fingers furiously at my clit, given more pressure by his hands. I peak just as he is subsiding, and moan loudly, bucking against him. So. Fucking. Good. I always get upset when he teases me, but I don't know what I'd do if he didn't. He holds me tight in place and lets me finish my orgasm as his thrusts slow, his hot cum leaking out of my pussy.

We both collapse there, catching our breath and holding one another. As my eyes open, I spot movement, and jump a little. It's just Iga. In our room. For some reason.

""Iga! What are you...?!"" I jump up and pull the covers to conceal my man's naughty bits from her.

""Sorry! Sorry! I just needed to grab something,"" she reaches under a chair and pulls out a pair of lace panties, ""I, uh, think our laundry got mixed up, and I was looking for these.""

I sigh, ""Fine, just knock next time, okay?""

""Will do, have a good night, Victoria,"", she says, then wiggles her fingers in a wave, ""You too, Eli.""

I let out a breath and collapse against his chest.

Wait, why were her panties under the chair, and how did she know they'd be... Oh, screw it, I'm tired.",,2025-08-15T18:56:25.131701,2530,
https://www.literotica.com/s/angels-first-visit,Angel's First Visit,Unknown Author,,,,,"Welcome to the private life of Aiden and Chastity, a young married couple living in the southern United States. Within their little circle of friends, they are the envy. They are the only ones still married, who haven't divorced and are never seen fighting in public.

Their reality is better, they could count how many times they've ever fought on one hand.

With that said, I must warn you, their personal life was full of secrets. During the week they lived life like any other couple, working and spending time with family and friends. Most weekends however, the two of them lived a completely different life. A life with freaky friends and special clubs for members only.

Within this hidden world, the two of them quickly found a home. They are both attractive, they both have great personalities, and they're both nice, which intrigued a lot of attention.

They decided to go to one of their favorite clubs, it sits right on the beach. It has a beautiful deck with hot tubs built in, and a great view of the ocean with the moon and tiki torches as your only light.

Shortly after they arrived, a female friend approached them.

""Hi guys."" as she leaned over to hug them both.

""Aiden, can I make a special request for tonight?""

""Sure, what's up?""

""Can I feel your Cat-Of-Nine Tails tonight?"" her face shying away from them.

Aiden had a reputation for being a safe dominant. It is normal for women to ask to feel his leathers. They knew he wouldn't hurt them.

""I think we can arrange that."" with a low giggle in his voice.

""Can I ask for one more thing?""

""Sure.""

""Can I feel it, between my legs?"" her face blushing in embarrassment.

Aiden smiles, ""Oh I think we can do that."" very happy to hear her request.

Aiden reached into his travel bag and pulled his cat out.

""Bend over."" in a stern voice. Pointing at the empty table next to them.

She bends over the table, placing her hands flat on the on the table beneath her stomach.

""Spread 'em."" Loud enough for anyone around to hear.

She spreads her legs.

Aiden begins to turn his cat in circles right behind her. A slow fan to make her feel the breeze of the leather chords spinning. Then slowly he begins to move in between her legs. Allowing every forth or fifth rotation to make direct contact with her crouch.

She jumps. It's not pain, only the surprise of not knowing when the next hit will come.

He begins to apply more pressure with each direct hit. Causing her to begin to squeal.

He stops letting his cat spin freely behind her and begins to hit her with every spin. He's hitting her harder and faster than before. The tips now hitting directly where her clit is throbbing under her jeans.

She slides her hands out from under her stomach and grabs the sides of the table.

Aiden continues his assault. Continuing to hit her harder than before. Each hit stopping the leather straps in their tracks right against her pussy.

She's moaning, now standing on her tip toes. You can see that she's beginning to feel the pain.

Aiden stopped abruptly, slides his hand between her legs, feeling her warm moist jeans.

""Good girl."" he whispers into her ear.

""Thank you, I loved it!""

Aiden grabs her hand to help her up off the table. Giving her a friendly hug, before she proceeds to run off and rejoin her husband, watching from the side.

When Aiden looked up he took notice of another girl he knew who asked if she could be next.

Aiden simply smiled, ""Take your position and wait.""

Smiling, taking his time to make a shot for Chastity and himself.

The girl was wearing a short pink plaid skirt, a white skin tight sleeveless mock turtleneck with lace design on the front that lets you see her cleavage bursting through top. She's wearing a pair of clear eight inch stripper heels with a platform on the front. She was clearly there for some attention. He was more than willing to give it to her and enjoy the show himself.

When she bends over the little table, she grabs ahold of both sides, and spreads her legs. She's not shy at all. She's bent over, her ass almost completely exposed, her pussy divulged for all to see. Her chest is pressed down on the table. Her ass, up in the air, highlighting her existence.

She's smiling, scanning the faces of everyone watching her.

Aiden lets her wait there for a couple minutes. He's enjoying the sight, he's sipping on his shot, laughing with Chastity and their friends.

""She's got a great ass."" he tells Chastity.

""I'd do her."" Smiling while sipping on her drink.

Aiden finishes his drink and places his glass back down on the table. He looks towards the girls husband, seeking the nod of approval.

Her husband simply stood there, off towards the corner with his arms crossed in front of him. He smiles and gives Aiden a nod of approval with a smile.

Aiden walks over towards the table, places his crotch up against hers. He places his left hand down on the table next to her face, allowing her to feel his cock throb through his pant against her pussy.

""Are you ready for this?"" he whispers in her ear.

""Yes..."" with nervous anticipation, lowering her head down on the table.

He pushes downward on the table, standing back up behind her, and begins to spin his cat behind her. Very fast, causing the breeze to raise and lower her skirt with each spin. He's leaning backwards as if to improve the viewing experience. A huge shit eaten grin.

Slowly, he bigs to spin his cat closer to her, causing the tips to begin hitting her, directly on her bare pussy. Each spin hitting her gently. Her skirt get's caught on one of the cords and rises up into the air, bending back onto her back, leaving her bare ass now fully exposed.

Aiden begins to hit her harder, not much, just a little more for her to feel.

He's smiling when he notices that the club lights are reflecting off of her pussy. She beginning to get wet.

He begins to hit her harder, causing his Cat to stop at the direct moment of impact. Her pussy is now starting to turn pink, her inner thigh beginning to twinkle from the lights reflecting.

She's soaking wet, he's just constantly hitting her. He takes notices, small bit of cum attached to the tip of his Cat, like a thin little taste fighting from being pulled away.

She begins to moan out, lifting her chest up off the table, her back arched in front of them.

He begins to hit her a little harder; a little bit faster.

Her knees begin to buckle. She moaning non-stop, fighting to keep herself standing in her hooker heels.

Aiden stops, he walks up and places his crotch against her, feeling her wetness make his pants moist, allowing her to feel is cock now hard, throbbing against her.

He places the cat down on the table with his left hand over hers.

""Now finish for me."" as he glides her right hand down between her legs, down between her soaking wet pussy and his rock hard dick throbbing against her. She begins to rub, roughly, she's so close to cumming.

He releases her right hand, still holding her left down on the table, his free hand reaching for a large chunk of her hair. Pulling her back up against him still rubbing on herself, moan in delight.

Her moans give way to screams, as Aiden is using her hair to thrust her back and forth, grinding his dick on her pussy, her fingers squeezing tightly between.

She's thrusting her fingers in between her legs faster than before. Without notice, she begins to squirt all over the floor, all over Aiden's crouch. She's screaming, shooting off in small loads, one after the other.

Aiden take's her head and shoves it back down on the table, her hand still thrashing against her pussy. There's a large mess on the floor, her shaking is causing the entire table to shake.

Suddenly, she stops moving, places her hand back on the table, and begins to breathe heavily, barely able to stand.

Aiden, slides himself back up against her, his dick back against her sensitive pussy. Each throbbing causing her to move forward a little. He places his right hand over top of hers.

""Is that what you wanted tonight?""

""Better!"" she gasps

""Perfect."" as he begins to lift her up from the table, crossing her arms in front of her leaning her back into his chest. Her head gently rolls back onto his shoulder. He softly kisses on her neck, tasting the sweat falling down from her hair.

""Are you ok to walk?""

""Yes, I'm good.""

""Good then go have fun now, you husband looks a little needy at the moment.""

She looks towards her husband, her head still resting on Aiden's shoulder.

Smiling, ""I think I can do that.""

Aiden releases her hands, she stands back up, and begins to slowly walk away. Her steps lazy, her heels dragging along the floor.

As she walks off, Aiden takes notice of a small line of ladies, eager to be next under his leather. The first girl in line, is none other, than the beautiful girl in the beautiful red dress. She's had a little bit of Aiden's attention ever since she strolled in. Her dress looks absolutely stunning on her. Like one you might see the ladies wear at a ballroom dance competition. It's tight on the top and flows all over the bottom with her every move. He skin is sun-kissed, her long strawberry blonde hair draped perfectly around her beautiful face, down to one side. Her body, ravishing. She hit's every physical desire Aiden has for a women.

Unfortunately, he has no idea who she is.

""Yesssssssssss?"" in a silly cute voice, as if to give her comfort.

""Can I be next?"" with a soft spoken voice, looking up to him.

""Assume the position."" pointing towards the table, a puddle still left from the previous girl's experience.

She slowly walks over to the table, stands there barefoot, her feet on both side of the puddle, careful not to step in it. She leans over, places her hands on the table, gripping both sides like she watched the previous girl do. Her chest down on the table.

She waits...

Aiden walks up to her side, places his hand on the spine of her lower back.

""Whose your husband?""

""I don't have one, I came with a couple of friends of mine, it's my first time here."" as if to explain why she should be welcomed.

""And you volunteered to get beaten by someone one you've never met?"" a small amount of shock in his voice.

""Uh huh."" hiding her face down in the table.

""Well, I don't normally do scenes with singles. I like that the married girls have their husbands there, ready to stop a scene if they think I've taken it to far.""

""Oh."" as she begins to slowly stand back up ""I'm sorry I didn't know.""

""No, don't get upset."" in a comforting voice.

""Hey Baby, come here for a moment."" looking over at Chastity sitting off on the side. Chastity gets up, and joins them standing next to the empty table.

""This is my wife Chastity. Your name is?""

""Angel."" With a small amount of sadness in her voice

""Well Angel, my name is Aiden. Now we are no longer strangers."" smiling again trying to give her comfort.

""Nice to meet you both."" An awkward smile on her face.

""Now, I'll make you a deal. I'll give you want you want; if, you can assure me that you will signal Chastity if you need me to stop.""

""I can do that.""

""Good, here's what we're going to do. You're going to keep your fist on the table with your thumb up."" Giving her the thumbs up sign.

""Then if you need me to stop, you're going to turn your thumb upside down and give the thumb down sign."" Giving her the thumbs down signal.

""Chastity will he watching very closely, if she sees you give me the thumbs down signal she's going to jump to your rescue. Can you accept that requirement?""

""Yea, I can do that.""

""Good."" as he kisses Chastity on the lips, motioning her to return to her seat.

""Assume the position."" he orders, stern and loud enough for everyone to hear. Angel smiling as she again assumes her position on the table.

Aiden leans over and whispers again in her ear. ""What do you want?""

""I want you to spank me, but not between my legs.""

""Then why are your legs spread? Put them together."" his hand resting on the table, his eyes glaring down at her bare feet. She begins to slowly place her feet together, first her left, stepping down in the now cold puddle, then her right.

""Why haven't you raised your dress yet? I can't spank you through your dress."" with an evil tone, attempting to guide her to his whim. She slowly starts pulling her dress up near the waist, exposing her ass in front of everyone.""

""And now your panties. Take 'em off.""

She reaches for her waist, standing back up and bending down at the knee to remove them. As she goes to completely take them off she has to step up from the puddle, now dripping on her own panties. She believes that this is all part of Aiden's scheme, to make her get the other girls juices on her panties.

Aiden's standing there with his hand out. He expects her to hand her panties over to him, which she does. They're quite warm and moist. A simple little red satin thong with a white cotton crotch. He can see and feel that she has already been wet tonight.

""Open your mouth!""

Angel, stands there in shock, as she slowly begins to open her mouth. Reality sinking in for her, Aiden begins to fold her panties into a small little bundle, with the crotch section ready to rest on her tongue. He places them in her mouth.

""Now bend over."" as he guides her back down onto the table. Pulling her dress back up to expose her bare ass to everyone.

""Don't forget about your thumb!""

""I'm going to use something a little different on you tonight, the cats not really a good tool for spanking with."" he whispers into her ear. He walks back to his travel bag and pulls out a leather strap. It's about 18 inches long and on one end it is cut into three separate slivers. It's a much better tool for spanking a beautiful girls ass.

As soon as everyone in the room noticed the new strap being brought out, they began to pay closer attention.

Aiden began striking Angel's bare ass, lightly, as to gauge her response to it. He was hitting her from the top of her ass to the top of her thighs. Slowly moving up and down and side to side on her. Attempting to give every inch a fair amount of spanking. It took very little effort before her skin began to turn pink. He hasn't even really started on her yet and her entire rear side is glowing.

""Give me your right hand behind your back!"" Aiden orders while still spanking softly on Angel.

She complies, placing her right hand behind her back, her left still resting on the table giving the thumbs up sign. He grabs ahold of her wrist and begins to hit her harder and with more direct force on her ass. She's starting to jump forward, she's not crying, just jumping from the pain.

Aiden notices that she is taking this without issue and begins to hit harder. He's hitting her harder than most could take, he ass is already the same color as her dress yet she keeps her thumb up. The sound of the strap hitting her ass can be heard by everyone in attendance. She's just jumping from the pains and starting to squeal from the sting, but her thumb is still up.

Aiden looks closely at her face while continuing his assault on her ass. He notices that she has a tear forming and about to roll down her cheek. He immediately stops and tosses his strap over to Chasity to put away.

This beautiful girl, bent over, fully exposed in front of everyone, was willing to shed tears before asking him to stop.

He grabbed Angel and stood her up placing her hands around his neck, pulled her panties out of her mouth and placed them down on the table.

""Are you ok little one?"" As he wiped her tears away with his thumbs.

""Yes, I'm good."" Slightly sobbing but holding back.

""Is your bottom ok?"" Still wiping away the tears.

""Yea, just sore.""

""Well thats good."" With a large smile as if to give her comfort. ""I didn't think you'd go that far."" He added still smiling.

""Neither did I.""

""Well, I'm going to ask if you'll sit next to my wife for a couple moments, so I can keep an eye on you, and make sure you're ok.""

She agreed and allowed him to escort her to the table to sit down next Chastity.

""Baby, can you make the three of us a shot?"" Aiden asked Chastity.

""Yes Sir."" As she pulled out three cups to pour them a shot.

He then reached into his travel bag and pulled out a little Dum Dum sucker. It was cherry to match Angel's her dress.

He looked over at Angel.

""Would the good little girl like a sucker?""

She smiled as she took it from his hand. She immediately opened it and started sucking on it. She thought this was her reward for being so brave, a reward she didn't see the other girls get. However, in reality, Aiden was worried about her blood sugar, her bottom now matched her red dress.

While Chastity made them shots and Angel sat their enjoying her sucker, Aiden looked back towards the line.

""Last one, I'm sorry ladies but I need a breather. I promise to make time for each and everyone of you.""

The next girl smiled and jumped up in front of Aiden.

""I want what she got!""

Like being spanked in public was as common as a Subway sandwich order.

She then jumped barefoot into what was left of the puddle on the floor, pulled her pants down, showing everyone she was commando tonight. She bent over the table and place her hand on the table with her thumb up. She had no idea why she had her thumb up, but the other girl did it and so will she.

Aiden just smiled shook his head in disbelief, looked over towards her husband and waited for the nod. He got it and it was time to go again.

He walked up behind her, placed his foot down in between her legs, on top of her jeans, causing them to soak up more of the puddle, staining them for when she puts them back on. He wanted her to experience more humiliation than the others.

He leans over her, ""I hope you know what you've signed up for little one."" he whispers in her ear. Her head just held tightly to the table, preparing for what was to come. He stands back up and removes his foot from between her legs and stands off to her side.

This time his mind was still on Angel. He started a lot harder on this girl, he wasn't quite in a hurry but he didn't want to spend all night doing this either. He didn't give her as much time as the others, no more than two minutes at max. By the look of her ass you wouldn't know it. Bright red, but no tears when he stopped.

He leaned over and whispered in her ear. ""I really like feeling you under my leather. I hope you'll give me the honor of another opportunity."" As if to make her feel special even though in his mind he just robbed her.

""I do too."" As she laughed her eyes giving that wicked evil look. He grabbed her hand, proceeded to kiss it while she stood up.

""Thank You."" He added as she pulled her clothes back on. You could see the various wet spot on her jeans, from her crouch down towards her ankles. Aiden was smiling, she simply turned around and back to her husband she went.

All that is left of that puddle on the floor, is a couple streaks that could be easily cleaned up with bar napkin.

Now he's done being the showtime experience, time to have some fun of his own.

""How's she doing?""

""Oh she's fine."" Chastity answers ""She was actually just telling me how much she likes your butt and that face you make when your beating on someone."" while giving an evil grin towards Angel.

Angel pushes her hands towards Chastity as to stop her from telling a secret, blushing in embarrassment.

Aiden similes, ""Stoppppppppppp..."" as if to be cute and innocent after beating on so many people.

He then grabbed his shot glass, offered it up for a cheers, to which the girls did too, ""To a fun night."" They then cheered their glasses together, Aiden and Chasity tapped their glasses on the table, which gave Angel a curious look, she had no idea why they did that.",,2025-08-15T18:57:06.425109,3651,
https://www.literotica.com/s/cuckquean-ch-06,Cuckquean Ch. 06,Unknown Author,,,,,"""Come with me,"" Lori said, heading for the bathroom, ""I need someone to attend to me.""

I followed.

Once again I had that feeling that his eyes were on me.

She sat on the toilet and smiled at me.

""You're liking all of this, aren't you?"" she asked as if we were sitting across the table talking about our kids or what had happened at the garden club.

She got that satisfied look we all get as I heard that hissing sound of a woman relieving herself.

""Well?"" she asked when I didn't answer.

I felt the blush spreading as I said, ""Yes. Well, it's overwhelming but, well, yes.""

She smiled and said, ""I am too. I was surprised, if we're being honest, at how much.""

She stopped talking for a moment, her face reddening a little, and the smell told me she was doing more than peeing.

She grinned at me and said, ""does it bother you that I'm enjoying degrading you?""

I had to think about that one.

""I guess,"" and suddenly I started laughing. The utter absurdity of what was happening struck me hard. Here I was, standing, watching my husband's girlfriend taking a shit, naked, and having a conversation. Well, she was naked and I was in now-three-day-worn clothes, stinking of sweat and sex, semen staining my dress and caked in my hair. I couldn't stop laughing.

""What?"" she asked, looking at me curiously.

""Oh,"" I said, kind of gasping for my breath the way you do after you've laughed that hard, ""it's just the absurdity of all of this.""

""Are you laughing at me?"" she said, and her smile had disappeared.

""No,"" I said, still chuckling, ""I'm laughing at

ME!

""

She smiled then, and I could see her body tense as it does when you're finishing your morning business, making that final push.

""Okay,"" she said, leaning back and parting her legs a little, ""wipe.""

I suppose I had known this was coming but I still had that little adrenaline rush deep in my belly.

When I hesitated she said, ""shall I call David and tell him you refuse?""

""No,"" I said, pulling off a couple of feet of toilet paper, the nice quilted stuff I always sprung for, and folding it into a pad.

She smiled and said, ""Good girl,"" as she spread her legs a bit more.

I wiped her pussy where she was wet and then, front to back as I had been taught as a girl, wiped back. After I wiped her ass I inspected the paper and when I saw the heavy brown stain dropped it into the water and pulled off another length.

When I finally had her clean she stood and went to the vanity. ""Yours?"" she asked, picking up a toothbrush from the little rack.

""David's,"" I said.

She put it back and picked up the other one. I watched as she used my toothbrush to brush her teeth.

""Go on,"" she said, an odd smile on her face, ""make breakfast and bring it up. We'll have it in bed.""

I heard her say, ""a little something before breakfast?"" as I headed for the kitchen.

I looked around, thinking, and got out eggs and bacon, set up the toaster, and loaded it with two English muffins cut in half. I broke a half-dozen eggs into a bowl, added a splash of milk, and began beating them with a fork, looking for that perfect color, the buttercup yellow my grandmother had taught me.

As I let the eggs come to room temperature I set the big frying pan and the flat skillet on the stove to warm.

I realized I was smiling and that made me laugh which made me smile more.

""You do know,"" I said to myself, ""that a psychiatrist would probably diagnose you as fucking nuts, do you not?""

And, of course, I was right.

Because on some level I really had no hope of understanding, I was happy.

Tired and dirty and stinking, preparing to serve my husband and his lover breakfast in bed, I was happy.

Doing such mundane domestic things, making breakfast, moving around the kitchen in which I had prepared thousands of meals, I was happy.

Even wondering what fresh humiliation, what new degradation awaited me, I was happy.

I put six strips of bacon on the griddle and then sprayed olive oil on the frying pan. I pushed down the lever to start toasting the English muffins. As the bacon got close to being done I poured the eggs into the frying pan. I added a sprinkle of cheese as I folded the omelet, spread butter onto the muffin, and laid the crispy bacon strips on two plates, finally, I laid the omelets on the plates making I nice presentation I thought.

I put the plates, silverware, and two big glasses of orange juice on the tray and headed upstairs.

As I cleared the door she was laying back, her legs spread and knees up while my husband had his face buried between her legs.

She smiled and waved me over.

""You trained him well, honey,"" she said, ""now feed me while he does what he does so well.""

So I did. I sat the tray on the little bedside table and scooted the chair I used when I did my makeup over beside the bed.

And I fed her.

Her control was amazing. I know how good David is with his mouth and tongue, and I could see her hips rock with what he was doing, but she maintained her control, opening her mouth for a bite, chewing, and then closing her lips when I wiped them with the napkin.

When the orgasm took her I thought for an instant I was going to have to Heimlich her. I had just fed her a bite of the omelet when she gasped her release. Her eyes got big and I could see her trying to breathe as her hips bucked through a second wave of the pleasure I knew he could give her.

She coughed, though, the little ball of egg and cheese flying across the room, and gasped a deep breath.

She was into the afterglow then, though, and opened her mouth.

So I finished feeding her the breakfast I had made.

When the plate was empty she belched, not a ladylike burp either, the kind of belch a teenage boy would be proud of, and patted David on the head.

""Breakfast, baby,"" she said and then smiled at me, ""while I get my dessert.""

When he leaned back, pushing himself to sit up on his heels, his face was a mask of her love honey. It was shiny and one long white thread hung from his chin. His hair looked like he had just stepped out of the shower.

He smiled at me, a happy, sort of ""good morning"" smile, scooted backward until he stepped off the bed, and walked over and kissed me.

And I'll be damned, but it was a good kiss.

Her scent was thick and her taste was on his lips.

I liked them both.

""Scoot,"" he said, patting Lori on her big hip.

She giggled, stretched luxuriantly, theatrically really, and started scooting down the bed.

He took her place, laying back with that same self-satisfied look she had earlier.

As I watched she squirmed around and took him into her mouth.

And I began feeding him his breakfast.

And there it was, that pressure in my belly, low, deep, making it clear in the way no words ever could, that I was happy with the choice I had made.

I had a conversation with myself as I fed him, wiping his lips after each bite, and trying to imagine the combination of sensations he was feeling, her mouth on his cock as his wife fed him.

Martha, this is crazy.

I knowwwwwwwwwww.

So quit.

I don't think I can.

Why?

I don't KNOWWWWW!

But none of that mattered. That damn pressure was building and past the mixed stinks of my body odor, old semen, womancum, and whatever residual soap I might have, I could smell my fresh arousal.

She was still on his cock as I popped the last bite of bacon into his mouth and put the glass of orange juice to his lips.

""Are you happy?"" he asked me and I couldn't help the smile.

""I am,"" I said simply.

""Come here,"" he said, and I stood and moved closer to the bed.

""Is this what you want?"" he asked, his hand lifting my dress and slowly moving up my leg.

""Yessssssssssssssssss,"" I said, completely unable to stop myself from drawing the alveolar sibilant out into a long hiss.

His hand moved to brush the tops of my thighs and my feet moved apart, again, with no thinking involved.

My breath caught as his fingertip touched my labia.

""Say please,"" he said, his voice soft and low, almost hypnotic.

""Please,"" I said and on some level, I was ashamed at the way my eyes overflowed and my nose started running but mostly I just didn't care.

""Tell me what you want,"" he said.

And the thing is, I didn't know how to answer that question. What did I want? More humiliation? A return to our previous life? A fucking threesome?

""Sorry, Martha,"" he said, and I thought I heard genuine regret in his voice, ""she who hesitates is lost,"" and he took his hand away making me sob, a brief bark of suffering.

""Sit,"" he said and I sat back on the little chair.

So I watched as Lori finished him. I could see the way he was responding in the growing tension in his body and the way his hips were rocking.

When she finished him she pushed back quickly off of the bed and came to where I was sitting.

I watched her approach, looking up.

When she bent over and started to open her mouth, his thick white semen starting to overflow, it seemed natural to open my mouth and accept her gift.

She bent and kissed me and then said, ""Jesus, get in there and shower. You smell like an overworked whore on a hot day.""

She climbed up onto the bed then and snuggled into David's shoulder. They both watched as I started undressing.

I got the dress unbuttoned and off of my shoulders and tossed it into the hamper.

I thought, ""fuck it,"" and turned to face them as I did the double-jointed thing all women learn with their first training bra, undid the six hooks of my bra, and shrugged it off.

""Damn,"" Lori said, ""now I'm jealous. Give those things a shake.""

I smiled and shimmied, making my heavy breasts swing side to side and, oddly, for the first time in years not ashamed of the way they sagged.

""Take it all off,"" she said. David said nothing, just watched.

So I got busy, aware of their eyes on me, feeling awkward and still, on some level, enjoying what was happening. I did the awkward two-step to get my shoes off and then the even more awkward dance to get my pantyhose and panties off.

Naked and, okay, oddly proud, I stood, waiting to see what was next.

""Go on,"" Lori said, ""shower but don't even look at a razor, got it?""

I nodded and she snapped, ""ANSWER ME!""

""Yes,"" I said, ""I've got it.""

I took my watch off, got the earrings out of my ears, and put them in my little jewelry box, my necklace joined it and I thought for a minute and took off my rings, leaving only my wedding band and engagement ring on my left hand.

I turned toward the bathroom but Lori's voice stopped me.

""Come here, Martha,"" she said.

But I didn't hesitate, I went.

""Give me the rings,"" she said, holding my hand out.

And oddly, this got to me more than all that had gone before. I felt that sudden rush, deep in my belly, as adrenaline coursed into my blood and those fight or flight reflexes all kicked in.

I looked at David but he just looked back at me, his face impassive.

""Please,"" I said, my voice breaking.

""Give. me. the. fucking. RINGS!"" she snapped, making each word a separate sentence.

And I felt something deep inside of me break. It wasn't a physical sensation, but somewhere deep in my mind, maybe in my soul, something broke.

I was sobbing, tears flowing down my cheeks almost blinding me, snot running from my nose, across my lips, and down my chin, as I took the rings off. I had put on weight and it was hard. I put my finger in my mouth and my snot and saliva lubricated enough that I could get the rings off.

I managed a soft, broken, ""please,"" although it came out more like ""p-p-p-p-p-please.""

She took my wedding set and tried it on the ring finger of her left hand but it was far too big.

It was loose on the bigger middle finger but it didn't fall off as she held it up in that way women have done since rings were invented, admiring it.

""Okay,"" she said, ""go on. Shoo. Wash your dirty ass and get back in here.""

I went.

I was crying, no, I was bawling. I was filthy. I stunk.

And deep in my belly, the pressure of sexual arousal was begging for release.",,2025-08-15T18:57:12.964527,2254,

https://www.literotica.com/s/trophies-ch-03,Trophies Ch. 03,Unknown Author,,,,,"""What the hell is the matter with you?"" Kendra yelled. ""I didn't give you that key so you could just waltz on in here whenever you pleased.""

Mr. Colins shook his head and gathered his surroundings. Roger and Kendra stood over him and he immediately sprang back to his feet.

""I was trying to get a hold of you. I thought something...""

""I was on a girl's trip with my daughter. I don't need to tell you everything about my life."" Kendra said.

""I understand that, but your husband...""

""My husband what? He's like a mosquito buzzing around and pissing you off but he'll never hurt me.""

""I apologize Ms. Blackwood."" Mr. Collins said.

""It's Mrs. West. And you know what, forget about the divorce. Ed and I will make do for now.""

""Kendra, what is going on with you?""

""You heard the lady, beat it asshole."" Roger said.

""Who the hell are you?""

""I'm her new man. Unlike you, I actually get invited over.""

""This is ridiculous. I will call you tomorrow to straighten things out."" Mr. Colins said. He quickly ran out of the man cave fearing another knock to the noggin.

Kendra froze in place as Ed came out of the next room.

""Hell yah Mr. W."" Rogers said with his hand up for a high five. Ed ignored him. ""So, is that how you were controlling the twins?""

Ed nodded.

""Can I try?""

Ed gripped his phone tight. His daughter's former lover was starting to learn too much. First it was the Decor camera, now it was the Kollar Tech items and furthermore he also knew Kendra's lawyer by name and face. And her lawyer knew him. Ed had a choice to make. Roger knew a lot but keeping him involved would inevitably make it impossible to get rid of him. At least now, he had only the faintest idea and if he tried anything, Ed would have no choice but to use a Kollar Tech item on him. If it came to that. There was just no benefit from having him around and Ed was tired of worrying about the stoner college kid. It was time to cut ties.

""You need to go now."" Ed said.

""Go? I still haven't finished with Mrs. W."" Roger said. ""I was looking forward to trying a few new positions.""

""Try them another time."" Ed said in a grumpy tone.

""Hey, did you forget that I brought you those two dime pieces. Saw you having a good time with them, too""

""I didn't ask you to do that. And you don't think fucking my wife is enough."" Ed said. ""Tell me, how many guys let you fuck their wife?""

Roger moved towards Kendra, but Ed blocked his path.

""I said go home, kid.""

Roger pushed Ed back. ""You know what. Fuck you man.""

Roger left the basement and Ed turned to his frozen, programmed wife. The interaction with the lawyer proved without any doubt that the devices worked. Even Kendra's nagging, self righteous voice was on full display. There was plenty to explore with the programmable item, but Ed had other things to tend to. Before someone came looking for them, it was time to let the twins go.

***

""Good job on the Berger investigation.""

Detective Melody Peele nodded her head in acknowledgement. It was one of her hardest and most satisfying cases to solve. Long nights, false leads, and dead ends littered the case work, but after a year, her intuitive nature and compounded evidence helped her put the final pieces together and catch Wrigley Berger in the act.

""Detective Peele, you have a visitor out front."" Another colleague said as he walked by.

Out front was one of Detective Peele's main contacts for legal questions and in return she had to field many illegitimate and oftentimes delusional legal inquires into people's lives.

""Mr. Collins. It's been a while. What can I do for you?"" Detective Peele asked.

""You know that Kollar Tech investigation you're putting together.""

""You mean the Kollar Tech investigation you asked me to put together?""

""Look, I know you think I'm crazy, but if you've never been to a Kollar Hotel, I don't know how else to explain it.""

""I have Mr. Collins. In fact, I've had a collar around my neck and was able to easily take it off."" Detective Peele said. ""So, I don't know what you have against this company, but your outlandish claims have no substance.""

One of her biggest regrets was taking Mr. Collins seriously and opening an investigation into Kollar Tech, a very large contributor to the city and, by proxy, her station. Questioning their ethics didn't seem like a big deal, but it had rustled a lot of feathers throughout her organization and Kollar Tech. She was brought in immediately to dispel any rumors through demonstrations of their products and told to wrap up the case quickly.

On paper she did just that. But off the record, she kept her own personal file of anything that may have come up including Mr. Collins accusations, of which there were many. The man had lost the benefit of the doubt when he cried wolf too many times. Detective Peele was good at being discreet, but putting her job on the line for someone who yelled whenever he imagined that there was a problem would soon see her out the door.

""I swear Melody. Something is up with one of my clients."" Mr. Collins said as he blocked the detective's path.

""I'm going to need more than a hunch.""

""I found her fucking another man.""

""Sounds like probable cause to dismiss your case."" Detective Peele said.

""No, she wouldn't do that. She was just letting him go to town. That's not how she...""

""For the sake of your own case, I suggest you stop talking. Look, I don't need to know your business, but having a client sleep with someone else doesn't sound like a problem and in your case, it sounds like jealousy.""

""Can you at least go talk to her and tell me if something doesn't seem off."" Mr. Collins said. ""If your gut tells you everything is fine, then this will be the last time I ask you for a favor. I promise.""

Detective Peele had a few cases on the go, but nothing urgent. If she could finally put this matter to bed, it would be a thorn out of her side for good.

""You promise?""

""I swear to God."" Mr. Collins crossed his hand over his chest.

One interview to never hear from the lawyer again. It was a no brainer.

""Email me the details, I'll follow up today.""

""Thanks Detective.""

Detective Peele nodded and went back to her desk. An annoying task, but she could already picture her life without the lawyer showing up and ruining her day.

**

The scene was just how he left it. The twins frozen while making their fake social media post and his daughter in the corner waiting like a doll. He wished he had more time with them, but with the rings on, he could summon them at any time. For now, it was getting late and there had already been too much excitement with Mr. Colins. It wouldn't surprise Ed if the sleazy lawyer called the police, although being able to control Kendra's actions was an easy solution to that problem.

Ed activated the rings and the twins fell in line at attention. If only he could keep them as slaves serving his every will. Two hot blondes at his beck and call, catering to his every need. Now that was a dream come true. But they needed to live their life too and continue to maintain their bodies and beauty. If anything, Ed could set it up to have one day a week of pampering. They could fit that into their busy schedules. And so would he, once he sorted out his wife and daughter and their new lives.

In the short-term, they were going make great slaves, but in the long-term they would make even better decorations. Just watching them stand at attention with their natural tendency to present their bodies in the most attractive way possible. Breasts pushed out, ass tight and accented by the heels and their faces contortioned into a sexy pout that said, 'take me now'. Their whole teen and young adult lives had been centered around social media and once they got the attention of millions of men, it only made sense that their default was to always look as sexy as they could.

After making out with each twin one last time, Ed opened the app to fully program them. Their memories of the day were modified so that they remembered buying weed and then taking a walk. There was an option to have them remember and not be able talk about their time at Ed's, but the less risky solution was to erase the memories completely. He didn't fully trust the software yet to be making that kind of a gamble.

Their personalities were kept the same because they needed to go about their normal lives without arising suspicions. However, as Ed scrolled through the behavior modifications, he came across a few interesting options. He couldn't always be around them, but he could start influencing changes in their lives. A smile spread across his face. Soon, he'd be watching their social media page with great interest.

***

Ed cut through his delicious chicken dish that had been prepared lovingly by his wife. Things were finally starting to look up now that he had reassigned roles to his once bitter family. Karla was now his loving wife and Kendra was his obedient, perfect daughter.

""To our loving family."" Ed said holding up a wine glass.

His new daughter and new wife clinked their wine glasses and drank up. Ed didn't just switch their roles mentally, he also made them wear each other's clothes. Kendra was dressed like a slutty young adult with her ripped denim booty shorts and low-cut crop top. The clothes were meant to be tight on Karla, so Kendra barely managed to fit into them. Her ass hung out and her tits were ready to pop at any moment under the pressure of the stringent bra.

Karla on the other hand, was wearing one of her mother's best dresses, had her face done up and of course, was wearing her mother's diamond engagement ring and wedding band. The role reversal even extended to their body language, with Karla sitting straight and proper while Kendra slouched over her plate.

This was the life and there weren't any drastic measures required to keep it that way. Kendra didn't have a job, or whatever she did as a job could easily be discontinued. Karla barely attended classes and could easily drop out of college. That took pressure off of Ed and allowed him to excel at work and then come home to two perfectly programmed angels that he could play with for his own amusement.

""Kendra, eat with your face.""

His former wife obediently put her fork and knife down and bent her face over the food, biting at the cooled chicken and mash potatoes without any help from her hands. Her face was messy in no time with bits of mashed potatoes around her mouth and on her forehead. Ed could barely keep his water down from laughing so hard. He turned to Karla who was quietly eating and watching her mother eat like an animal without a reaction.

""Karla sweetheart, eat with your tits out."" Ed said.

Karla put her fork down and fished her breasts out of her dress, so they were on full display. Without saying a word, she picked her fork back up and continued eating. The sight of the hot young blond and her perfect round tits mixed with the flashing of her expensive ring was getting Ed hard. Suddenly, his hunger disappeared and, in its place, came the sexual hunger, lust. It brought him back to the memories of when he and Kendra had first started out. Her young body curvy in all the right places.

Ed couldn't concentrate. He needed release.

""Karla...""

The doorbell rang. Frustratingly, Ed mockingly bit his fist at the sight of his daughter and the unfortunate interruption. The good thing was that he had all night to fulfill his desires. If Roger wanted to be a nuisance, Ed was going to give him a piece of his mind. With his daughter's tits back under wraps and Kendra sent to clean the kitchen, Ed hurried to the door to dispose of the distraction.

""Kid, what did I..."" Ed opened the door and stopped at the sight of a cop.

""Were you expecting someone else?"" the gorgeous cop said.

""Been getting a lot of foot traffic from door-to-door salesmen lately."" Ed said.

""Little outdated method, but who am I to judge."" she said.

""What can I do for you officer?"" Ed asked.

""Is your wife home?""

""No, she's...""

""Who is it honey?"" Karla said coming to the door.

Ed could see the confusion on the cop's face. Sweat starting dripping down his forehead.

""Who are you?"" the cop asked.

""I'm his wife, K...""

""Kendra. This if my wife Kendra."" Ed interrupted.

""Huh."" the cop shook her hand.

A loud clanking of dishes came from the kitchen.

""Is someone else home?""

""I think my wife just has something on the stove."" Ed turned to Karla. ""Honey can you go check on the food. Please.""

Thankfully, she still obeyed commands. Any back talk or questioning was only going only going to make matters worse. Karla nodded at the cop and left to her duties.

""I thought you said she wasn't home.""

Ed laughed. ""No what I meant was... we were going to... we were about to have sex.""

The cop smirked. ""Cockblocking is part of our job description.""

""You never said why you were here.""

""You know what, I can come back at a better time."" The cop handed him a card. Detective Melody Peele. ""You have a good dinn...evening, sir.""

""Thanks Detective Peele."" Ed said. He shut the door.

This had Collins written all over it. That pesky lawyer was probing too much into his business. Instead of a peaceful life with his wife and daughter, now he had to deal with a cop snooping around. There was only one way to resolve this. Ed went to his office and opened the top drawer of his desk. It was empty. There was nothing in it. The camera was gone!

***

""Yah, how old was the woman client of yours."" Detective Peele said. ""Uh huh... Thought so...I'll let you know when I have something to report.""

She hung up the phone. To go back right away would be stupid. Catching someone off guard always produced the best answers. She'd be back, but it needed to be when he least expected it.

***

""Shit...Shit shit shit.""

The room was a mess, and the conclusion was all but confirmed with the camera nowhere in sight. Roger had taken it. In the brief time he had while leaving the house, he had swiped the one thing Ed should have kept under lock and key when it wasn't in use.

Kendra was busy doing the dishes while Karla was waiting in the bedroom for after dinner sex. But there was no time for that now. He had to find Roger before the kid wreaked irreversible havoc. With the new tech items, it wasn't that Ed even needed the camera, but having a horny college kid running around was going to draw the worst kind of attention, especially from Michael and his company.

Ed grabbed his keys and headed upstairs. If he was going to find the little punk, he needed to know where he frequented. Thankfully, he had the best intel for that right under his control.

***

Karla was an open vault of information and gave Ed everything he needed to know to track down Roger. That's if he didn't veer from his usual scene. Under the influence of something like the camera, anything was possible.

The stoner's house was a typical middle income, one car garage home. According to Karla, Roger lived with his older sister and mother, but was constantly fighting with them. Even with Karla around, the women tried to gain her trust and use her against Roger. Ed understood his frame of mind better, but that didn't take away from the fact that he took the camera without permission.

Ed knocked on the door and there was no answer. He tried again. Nothing. Either they weren't home or there were other implications at play. Thanks to his daughter, he knew that there was a spare key to the house hidden in the backyard. Young lovers and their trust. Ed opened the backdoor and walked inside.

The house was clean, likely a testament to its two female occupants and one male occupant who preferred to be anywhere else. The lack of noise from anywhere in the house indicated Roger had already come and gone. Ed passed through the hall and into the kitchen. Someone had eaten dinner for one and left a mess. Not a good sign. Roger only had the camera, so ordering someone around wasn't something he could do.

The next stop was the living room where he found some female undergarments. The television was on, but it was on mute. The silence was eerie. Ed had to be careful if Roger was home. The last thing he wanted was to be frozen himself. Ed checked the bedrooms starting with the sister's and mother's, but still found no signs of anyone. The last bedroom to check was Roger's.

There was no room for subtly. Ed needed to use the element of surprise to catch him off guard especially if he was in the middle of a sexual act. He gripped the doorknob tightly and then plowed through the door. But like the rest of the rooms in the house, it was empty. Comic books were stacked high on shelves with a collection of video games, Star Wars paraphernalia, and superhero movies. This let Ed peer into the mind of a college kid and offered him insight on his target. He liked superheroes and he played a lot of video games.

Ed smelled the weed before he spotted it on the messy desk. Probably the least surprising thing he had found out about Roger. His laptop was locked so that was a dead end, and his desk was scarcely used. The closet was a mess as one could expect with a college kid. There were no leads, or any indication of what Roger was planning. If he even had a plan.

On his way out of the house, he passed by a door in the kitchen. The basement. Ed didn't like to admit it, but he and Roger were similar in many ways including their taste in comics. It stood to reason that Roger also liked to spend most of his time downstairs away from the nagging females in a place that they likely never ventured. He opened the door and slowly made his way down the stairs.

Ellie brushed her hair in the mirror. There was something that seemed off, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. The entire day had been a blur ever since she and Niki had gone to get weed. She wasn't much of a pot smoker, but the lack of memory was really putting her off doing it again.

The gold ring on her finger was rather peculiar. She couldn't remember ever buying it, yet she knew it belonged to her. Her eyes wandered up to the reflection staring back. All the time and effort she put into looking hot for her social media. Presenting herself as the perfect female full of confidence when that was far from the truth. It took a lot of work to maintain that image for her fans every day. But it was hard.

The door burst open, breaking Ellie's trance. Niki stormed in, already made-up and prepared for the day. She could tell her sister was seemingly out of sorts.

""El, you all right?""

""Um yah, just finishing up."" Ellie said. Her hands moved back to brushing her hair.

""Actually, I'm glad you haven't done your makeup yet. I could use a little relief.""

""Excuse me?"" Ellie said.

""Get on the bed, I want to ride your face.""

Aside from pretending during photoshoots, Ellie had never been closely intimate with her sister. But for some reason, the idea of her sister riding her face seemed completely acceptable. Normal even. She put down her hairbrush and walked over to the bed, laying down with her head at the edge. To her surprise, Niki took out her phone and started recording.

""Hiii everyone. As I said on my vanilla profile, I will be starting a new profile separate from my sister in which we get to see how far little Ellie will let me dominate her. Right now, I'm about to ride her cute little face."" Niki moved the phone closer indicating the camera was now on Ellie. ""Say that you can't wait for your hotter sister to fuck your face.""

""I can't wait for my hotter sister to fuck my face."" Ellie said.

The whole experience was starting to feel like something out of a dream. Of the two, Niki had always been the nicer one and now she was making Ellie the star of her own new channel. There had been no discussion or agreement about this new channel or its intended content. Yet here was Ellie, waiting eagerly for Niki to use her.",,2025-08-15T18:57:26.189622,3641,
https://www.literotica.com/s/carlys-wmaf-fantasy-pt-27,Carly's WMAF Fantasy Pt. 27,Unknown Author,,,,,"I thought I'd finished this story. And then I wrote a honeymoon chapter as kind of a ""for fun"" exercise. But then I was definitely done. And then my supporters begged me to finish out the honeymoon. But then I was DEFINITELY done. And then people asked me to keep writing and they kept giving me good ideas. So now I'm four chapters in to the next book of the Carly and Jay saga. Damn you guys! I'll be writing chapter 3,012 of this on my deathbed!!

Seriously though, the outpouring of support for this to continue has been really heartening. So I'll definitely keep writing the epic story of Jay and Carly for awhile longer.

My wife and I... and boy is that weird to type... My wife and I went straight to the airport from the reception. Neither of us wanted to hang around long. We were packed and already mentally checking onto the plane. As Carly said her goodbyes to her family, I took a moment with some of the girls.

""I'm going to miss you,"" I told Kyrsten as I held her close, our foreheads pressed together and our lips merely inches apart.

""Me too. You guys deserve some time alone though,"" she said back to me softly before giving me a quick kiss. ""Just come back with plenty of energy to fulfill your manly duties."" Her pink lips smiled up at me and I couldn't help but grin back.

""I promise,"" I told her before turning to Louise who was standing next to us with her hands behind her back looking very anxious.

""You aren't going to forget about us are you Mr. S?""

I smirked at the faux coquette voice she sometimes adopted. She knew the effect it had on me. ""Of course not, babe.""

""I just worry that a whole week with the new Mrs. S and you will realize how good you've got it.""

I laughed, ""A whole week of Carly reminding me that I need to seduce other women? She'll have me so brainwashed I'll be wanting to recruit half the island into a new age harem.""

Louise smiled and leaned in to give me a kiss, ""Only if I get to help, Mr. S."" I kissed her back and gave her a little smack on the ass causing her to yelp cheerily.

I looked over to Carly who was still deep in a discussion with her sister, Sherry. I turned to Victoria who was close by and gestured for her to come over. She practically hopped over to me sporting a beautiful smile across her pretty face. Victoria had changed a lot since she'd declared herself my ""work wife"". She'd become more open to things and also proven how attuned to my wants and desires she could be. She wore a little more makeup now. Dressed a little bit sluttier now. Acted a little more sexy now. Case in point, she came up to me and before I could say anything she daintily placed her hand on my shoulder, ""My feet are killing me Mr. S. These five inch heels are brutal."" She leaned forward to take off her shoe but never took her eyes from my face. Her dress gaped open giving me a view straight down her unencumbered cleavage and down her loosely draped dress to the treasure below. She repeated the show with the other shoe, again looking me in the eyes (or she would have been if my eyes could remove themselves from the bountiful valley she was exposing). I could see her lick her lips out of the corner of my eye which caused me to snap back and see her smiling at me, knowing that she'd caught my attention for her little show. ""What do you need, Mr. S? I'm happy to help with... anything.""

I smiled and stroked her cheek gently, ""I'm going to take you up on that in a week or so when I'm back. Meanwhile, I need you to take care of things at the office, okay.""

She frowned slightly but nodded, ""Of course, Mr. S. Are you still planning,"" she dropped her voice and looked around, ""on leaving soon?""

I nodded.

""Am I coming with you?""

""We'll talk about it... but if you want, yes,"" I said.

She smiled and the look of concern on her face washed away. I gave her a little kiss and shooed her off so I could gather up my new bride. Carly finished kissing her sister goodbye. A kiss that, on momentary reflection, might have been the most chaste kiss I'd ever seen the two give each other. She walked up to me and practically melted in my arms, hugging me tightly as our arms wrapped around each other. I kissed the top of her head and whispered, ""I love you.""

""I love you too, my Master. My husband. My love.""

""Carly... how would you like this honeymoon to play out? A last week of normal romance before a lifetime of sharing or a start to a grand adventure of permanent miserable arousal?""

I felt her shudder in my arms at the words and, as if that shudder wasn't enough, she whispered back, ""Whatever you want, Master. WHATEVER you want.""

I fished the keys out of my pocket and pressed them into her hand, ""You're driving."" I looked up and saw my parents talking to Sasha, my ex-girlfriend. ""Sasha. Time to start paying up,"" I said. She didn't hesitate. She waved goodbye to my parents and jogged towards me as fast as her heels would allow. My Mom got a funny look on her face but before she could say anything, Max walked up and introduced them to Starla.

Sasha walked up beside us as Carly and I were still hugging, ""Sasha, you're riding to the airport with us.""

""Yes, Master,"" she said without hesitation. The grin on her face was easy to read. She was happy to finally be asked to do something. I could see the curiosity and mischievousness in her eyes and was briefly reminded of the good times while we were dating. Carly and I waved goodbye to everyone and ran to the car, being showered with bird seed and laughing the whole way. Carly zipped around to the driver side while I reached back to beckon Sasha to join us. The people outside of our inner circle all watched in confusion while all of our friends simply laughed as I ushered Sasha into the back seat and then slid in next to her. I closed the door behind me and pulled Sasha down as I was already unzipping my pants. Carly put the car in drive and started out of the parking lot, adjusting the mirror so she could see my eyes. I winked at her and she blew me a kiss back just as Sasha's lips enveloped me.

My expression must have changed because Carly asked, ""Is she good, Master?""

""Oh yeah,"" I said, ""I'd forgotten how good at sucking cock she was.""

""Really? I had just assumed she was kind of a prissy, too-good-to-suck-cock, kind of girl.""

""Nope... for all her faults, that wasn't one of them,"" I said as I gripped her ponytail and controlled her pace. ""Maybe I should bring her on our honeymoon as my personal fluffer? To keep me hard for all the girls I'm going to be fucking.""

Carly laughed, ""If you want, Master. Though I'm happy to provide those services as well.""

""Sure... but then you could also have someone to lick your little pussy all week while you watch me make conquest after conquest.""

Carly shuddered at the thought but said, ""I'd prefer to not cum, Master. I would rather only ever cum from you for the rest of my life.""

""I love you, Carly.""

""I love you, too Jay.""

""But who said anything about you cumming this week?""

Her eyes got wide, ""You'd bring your EX-girlfriend,"" she said with emphasis, ""Make her suck your cock to get it hard for other women. Then you'd have her edge me but not let me cum while you made me watch?""

I nodded then leaned my head back as I continued pushing Sasha up and down on my shaft.

""That's so deliciously cruel, Master. I would be totally okay with that, you know.""

""I know, slut. And maybe my next honeymoon you can serve that role for Kyrsten. But I don't want this cheap whore on our honeymoon,"" I said. This time I held Sasha down on my cock until she started to sputter. When I let her up, she looked up at me with a worshipful, submissive look. Her eyes were a bit of a teary mess already.

""Thank you, Master. This worthless cunt doesn't deserve to share in your honeymoon, Master.""

I looked at Sasha and my heart went out to her. I had to remind myself that her biggest crime was being naive and getting manipulated. To manipulate her more seemed hardly fair.

""You do deserve happiness, Sasha. But not yet. Not with me yet.""

""Yet?"" she asked hopefully.

I laughed and guided her back down to my cock. ""We'll see."" She wordlessly engulfed my cock again, sucking it into the back of her throat with renewed passion and vigor.

""So Carly, how many women do you think I will hook up with this week?""

""I think the over/under for the group pool is 6, Master.""

""You guys started a betting pool for women I'd bed?""

""Yes, Master. The girls thought it would be an excellent idea. There's two grids that the girls made. One is number of new women and number of new girlfriends. I have 7 women and 1 new girlfriend. The other is number of orgasms given vs. received. I put that one at 30 given and 15 received.""

""You think I'm going to give 30 orgasms to 7 women this week?""

""You're a very generous lover, Master.""

Sasha murmured her agreement with that sentiment as she continued to bob up and down on my surging cock. ""How much is in the pool?""

""It's not that kind of pool, Master.""

""Huh?"" I said. The blood was rushing away from my brain and I thought I might have misunderstood.

""Well we all have pretty different income levels so we decided money wouldn't be fair to wager.""

""What did you decide?""

""The winner of the orgasm pool gets to be your plaything for a week. The other one gets to set you up on a date... I really hope I win the second one.""

I couldn't help but laugh. The idea that these girls were betting for sexual favors for me just seemed too preposterous for words. Of course, looking down at Sasha's dusky brown hair as she furiously tried to suck all of my cum from my balls reminded me I was living in the craziest timeline.

""Hrmm... which one of my sluts has the hottest group of friends with untapped potential?""

Carly frowned, ""You don't want me to win, Master?"" Her face looked sad but I could tell from her tone she was amused.

""Tell me, babe. If I wanted to have the hottest slut servicing me in the future, who do you think would do the best job of setting me up?""

""Hrmm... I don't honestly know, Master. Kyrsten or Rebeccah... oh... or Alex with all of her dancer friends. But they're not local... I guess neither are Kyrsten or Rebeccah's friends.""

""They'll be more local when we move down to Florida. Or maybe I should bet on the future. You, Kyrsten, Louise and Victoria will have to make all new friends in Florida. Who will have the hottest friends when we move down there?""

""So Victoria is coming too?""

I smiled, ""You caught that, huh?""

Carly nodded, ""That's good. I really like her. And she is head over heels for you. But to answer your question... Louise. She'll be going to school and can provide you with an endless string of eager to please coeds. Just imagine the parties we'll be having,"" she said. I did and the litany of mental images made the damn burst. I erupted without warning into Sasha's sucking mouth. She made happy, pleasant sounds as she slurped it all down, not letting any of it go to waste.

""You swallowed?"" I said. As good as her blow jobs had always been, swallowing was never her thing. She was disgusted by it. Or so she used to say.

Sasha sat up, wiping her mouth in the process and smiled a small, tight smile. ""Yes, Master. I was told I should always either swallow your cum or wear it.""

""Told by whom?"" I asked with curiosity.

""Uhmm.. Carly, Kyrsten, Louise, Sherry, Rebeccah..."" she said listing off my girls and not showing any signs of stopping.

""We're always looking out for our Master... Master."" Carly caught my eyes again in the mirror and smiled.

""Okay... then what does Louise have in the pool?""

""That's not really in keeping with the spirit of the bet, Master,"" Carly said. Her eyes sparkled in the rear view mirror and she squirmed a little.

""Does the idea of me cheating at the game, so that my girlfriend can win a bet that lets her set me up with other sluts to bed turn you on, Carly?

Carly's eyes rolled in her head and Sasha answered for her. My ex-girlfriend's voice was deep and breathy in my ear, ""It turns all of us on, Master. Do what you want to take what you want. That's all we desire.""

I slid my hand up Sasha's thigh until I felt the warmth emanating from her core. She resisted the urge to squirm towards my thick, teasing fingers. ""So tell me, Carly. What do I have to do to obligate Louise to be my little slut seeker while she's going to school?""

Carly composed herself and chuckled, ""I'm pretty sure she'd do that no matter what, Master. We all would.""

""Yeah... but I like the idea of her being required to.""

""7 girls, 2 girlfriends, Master.""

""Perfect. I'll shoot for that and if I don't get there, you'll take home the prize.""

""Mmm... No I'm going to be so torn when you're at 7 and 1, master. Whatever will my little bimbo head decide upon?"" She said the last with a sing song, vapid voice that made my cock twitch slightly. Sasha noticed and leaned down to nuzzle my cock a little more while we finished our ride to the airport.

When we arrived, it was, as always, a zoo. We got our bags and Carly gave Sasha the keys before leaning over to whisper something in my ex's ear. Sasha shuddered and blushed as her eyes flicked over to me. She smiled and nodded back to Carly who came over to join me. ""What was that all about?"" I asked as I wrapped my arm around her slender waist.

""I'll tell you if you want, Master... but I think it would be better as a surprise.""

""A sexy surprise?""

""Always, Master. You know how sneaky us Asians can be,"" she said with a playful smirk. I gave her ass a little pinch and she giggled before snuggling back into my shoulder as we walked. The rest of the airport trip and the flight were uneventful. Unfortunately, the flight was absolutely packed both on the first leg and the second. Fortunately, I was absolutely blown away by my wonderful new wife's honeymoon plans. I was a little surprised when our flights had us heading for Paris. When Carly handed me my final destination ticket that said ""SEY"" on it, my eyes bugged out a little. ""The Seychelles?"" I asked.

She nodded and smiled, ""Not just any old random Seychelles luxury resort either, Master. Only the best for you. North Island."" Her tone clearly indicated she'd know what that meant. I was baffled.

""Fill me in?""

""It's where William and Kate had their honeymoon?""

""So I'm guessing it's nice?""

""And private and only populated by super high end individuals. Only the best for my Master,"" she said the last a little too loudly and we got a funny look from a security guard. I had a momentary panic that we'd be arrested on human trafficking charges or something but Carly just giggled and waved to the man with a friendly, disarming smile.

""How much did this cost?""

""Less than you think,"" she said a little defensively as we handed our boarding passes to the attendant.

""Well... I'm thinking 50 grand.""

""Pretty close actually,"" she said, ""48 with the plane tickets. Although my new wardrobe pushed it over 50 if you make me count that.""

""You bought a whole new wardrobe... wait... you only had the one bag,"" I said in confusion.

""Of course, Master. It turns out sexy, slutty things pack very well.""

She looked at me with such a sweet, innocent expression that I had to lean over and kiss her. Our new life together was starting out almost as interestingly as our dating life had begun. We both slept on the flight from Paris to the Seychelles. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a car service that took us privately to a boat that took us out to our final destination. ""People usually take helicopters but a boat seems so much better, don't you think, Master?"" she asked me, not caring that the driver of our small seagoing vessel could hear. When she knew she had my full attention, she peeled off her shirt revealing the tiniest, sheerest bikini top I'd ever seen. It was white and nearly transparent. It barely covered her nipples but did nothing to obscure one's view of them. I momentarily forgot all plans of bedding other women and simply wanted to spend a week fucking this beautiful woman who was the love of my life. Carly's eyes twinkled knowingly before she flicked them slightly back to the boat's driver.

With all that had been happening over the last hour or so, I really hadn't even noticed. Apparently being in a tropical paradise really messes with your radar for these kinds of things because the driver was stunning. She looked young, maybe 22 or 23, with light brown skin that had been honed to a gorgeous bronze by the sun. She might have been latino or Indian, it was impossible to tell. She was wearing a tight blue polo shirt and short brown khaki shorts that showed off her gorgeous legs. She caught me looking and smiled before saying, ""You're very lucky, Sir. Is this your honeymoon?""

""That obvious?"" I said returning her smile.

""A safe guess more than an educated one, Sir. Honeymoons are about 40% of our clientele.""

""What's the other 60%?""

She shrugged, causing her small, pert breasts to rub against her shirt. I was grateful for the sunglasses I was wearing that she couldn't see my eyes flick down as I studied her. ""Bachelor and Bachelorette parties, the occasional family vacation or corporate retreat. We also get a fair bit of repeat business because people love it so much here.""

I can imagine, I said as I looked out at the gorgeous open ocean. The small town of Victoria seemed to exist almost purely to support tourists. Not surprising given how close to paradise this all seemed. I turned my attention back to Carly who sat there smugly looking at me and holding up a single finger. ""That's your first one,"" she was saying silently.

""What's your name?""

""Irene,"" our driver said over the loud roar of the speedboat's engine. ""Irene Adler.""

I raised my eyebrow, ""Like the Sherlock Holmes character?""

She laughed, ""My mom liked the character and thought nobody would ever notice.""

Her infectious laugh sounded lovely despite the competing noise, ""How's that working out?""

""It was fine for about 15 years. Rarely ever came up. Then Benedict Cumberbatch came along and suddenly everyone knows it.""

""Bummer,"" I said.

""It was right up until he came for a trip to visit last September. It was nice to have a conversation starter with someone like that.""

Carly and I busted out laughing, imagining the scene. Irene's blush indicated that maybe there was a little more to the story than she'd indicated but I didn't want to press. That was her business.

""How long have you been working here?""

""This is my first year. I wanted to have a gap year after college before going into the real world. This seemed like an amazing opportunity.""

""I bet. You probably meet all kinds of people.""

""Yes, Sir. Some of them have very interesting lifestyles,"" she said with a crooked smile as she nodded towards my wife who was sitting there watching us. She wasn't being at all subtle about her interest.

""Well we're no exception,"" I said, deciding to go with the direct route for once. Honesty being the best policy and all, ""We're hoping to have a pretty unconventional honeymoon.""

""How unconventional?"" Irene asked. She flipped her curly brown hair back to the other side of her face, giving me an unobstructed view of her beauty.

""No sex for my wife,"" I said. Carly simply smiled and nodded her agreement.

""I assume that restriction doesn't apply to you?""

""Why would it?"" I asked as I stepped just a little closer to her. I didn't want to loom over her but stood about a foot from her, drawing myself up to my full height. She was only about 5'4"" so it forced her to look up at me which she did without hesitation.

""It shouldn't, Sir. I suspect you'll find all kinds of interesting things... and people... to do here.""

""Are you the one that will show us around this week? I'd like to see more of you?""

=== PAGE BREAK ===

I thought I'd finished this story. And then I wrote a honeymoon chapter as kind of a ""for fun"" exercise. But then I was definitely done. And then my supporters begged me to finish out the honeymoon. But then I was DEFINITELY done. And then people asked me to keep writing and they kept giving me good ideas. So now I'm four chapters in to the next book of the Carly and Jay saga. Damn you guys! I'll be writing chapter 3,012 of this on my deathbed!!

Seriously though, the outpouring of support for this to continue has been really heartening. So I'll definitely keep writing the epic story of Jay and Carly for awhile longer.

""I'm going to miss you,"" I told Kyrsten as I held her close, our foreheads pressed together and our lips merely inches apart.

""Me too. You guys deserve some time alone though,"" she said back to me softly before giving me a quick kiss. ""Just come back with plenty of energy to fulfill your manly duties."" Her pink lips smiled up at me and I couldn't help but grin back.

""I promise,"" I told her before turning to Louise who was standing next to us with her hands behind her back looking very anxious.

""You aren't going to forget about us are you Mr. S?""

I smirked at the faux coquette voice she sometimes adopted. She knew the effect it had on me. ""Of course not, babe.""

""I just worry that a whole week with the new Mrs. S and you will realize how good you've got it.""

I laughed, ""A whole week of Carly reminding me that I need to seduce other women? She'll have me so brainwashed I'll be wanting to recruit half the island into a new age harem.""

Louise smiled and leaned in to give me a kiss, ""Only if I get to help, Mr. S."" I kissed her back and gave her a little smack on the ass causing her to yelp cheerily.

I looked over to Carly who was still deep in a discussion with her sister, Sherry. I turned to Victoria who was close by and gestured for her to come over.

I could see her lick her lips out of the corner of my eye which caused me to snap back and see her smiling at me, knowing that she'd caught my attention for her little show. ""What do you need, Mr. S? I'm happy to help with... anything.""

I smiled and stroked her cheek gently, ""I'm going to take you up on that in a week or so when I'm back. Meanwhile, I need you to take care of things at the office, okay.""

She frowned slightly but nodded, ""Of course, Mr. S. Are you still planning,"" she dropped her voice and looked around, ""on leaving soon?""

I nodded.

""Am I coming with you?""

""We'll talk about it... but if you want, yes,"" I said.

She smiled and the look of concern on her face washed away. I gave her a little kiss and shooed her off so I could gather up my new bride. Carly finished kissing her sister goodbye. A kiss that, on momentary reflection, might have been the most chaste kiss I'd ever seen the two give each other. She walked up to me and practically melted in my arms, hugging me tightly as our arms wrapped around each other. I kissed the top of her head and whispered, ""I love you.""

""I love you too, my Master. My husband. My love.""

""Carly... how would you like this honeymoon to play out? A last week of normal romance before a lifetime of sharing or a start to a grand adventure of permanent miserable arousal?""

I felt her shudder in my arms at the words and, as if that shudder wasn't enough, she whispered back, ""Whatever you want, Master. WHATEVER you want.""

I fished the keys out of my pocket and pressed them into her hand, ""You're driving."" I looked up and saw my parents talking to Sasha, my ex-girlfriend. ""Sasha. Time to start paying up,"" I said. She didn't hesitate. She waved goodbye to my parents and jogged towards me as fast as her heels would allow. My Mom got a funny look on her face but before she could say anything, Max walked up and introduced them to Starla.

Sasha walked up beside us as Carly and I were still hugging, ""Sasha, you're riding to the airport with us.""

""Yes, Master,"" she said without hesitation. The grin on her face was easy to read. She was happy to finally be asked to do something. I could see the curiosity and mischievousness in her eyes and was briefly reminded of the good times while we were dating. Carly and I waved goodbye to everyone and ran to the car, being showered with bird seed and laughing the whole way. Carly zipped around to the driver side while I reached back to beckon Sasha to join us. The people outside of our inner circle all watched in confusion while all of our friends simply laughed as I ushered Sasha into the back seat and then slid in next to her.

I winked at her and she blew me a kiss back just as Sasha's lips enveloped me.

My expression must have changed because Carly asked, ""Is she good, Master?""

""Oh yeah,"" I said, ""I'd forgotten how good at sucking cock she was.""

""Really? I had just assumed she was kind of a prissy, too-good-to-suck-cock, kind of girl.""

""Nope... for all her faults, that wasn't one of them,"" I said as I gripped her ponytail and controlled her pace. ""Maybe I should bring her on our honeymoon as my personal fluffer? To keep me hard for all the girls I'm going to be fucking.""

Carly laughed, ""If you want, Master. Though I'm happy to provide those services as well.""

""Sure... but then you could also have someone to lick your little pussy all week while you watch me make conquest after conquest.""

Carly shuddered at the thought but said, ""I'd prefer to not cum, Master. I would rather only ever cum from you for the rest of my life.""

""I love you, Carly.""

""I love you, too Jay.""

""But who said anything about you cumming this week?""

Her eyes got wide, ""You'd bring your EX-girlfriend,"" she said with emphasis, ""Make her suck your cock to get it hard for other women. Then you'd have her edge me but not let me cum while you made me watch?""

I nodded then leaned my head back as I continued pushing Sasha up and down on my shaft.

""That's so deliciously cruel, Master. I would be totally okay with that, you know.""

""I know, slut. And maybe my next honeymoon you can serve that role for Kyrsten. But I don't want this cheap whore on our honeymoon,"" I said. This time I held Sasha down on my cock until she started to sputter. When I let her up, she looked up at me with a worshipful, submissive look. Her eyes were a bit of a teary mess already.

""Thank you, Master. This worthless cunt doesn't deserve to share in your honeymoon, Master.""

I looked at Sasha and my heart went out to her. I had to remind myself that her biggest crime was being naive and getting manipulated. To manipulate her more seemed hardly fair.

""You do deserve happiness, Sasha. But not yet. Not with me yet.""

""Yet?"" she asked hopefully.

I laughed and guided her back down to my cock. ""We'll see."" She wordlessly engulfed my cock again, sucking it into the back of her throat with renewed passion and vigor.

""So Carly, how many women do you think I will hook up with this week?""

""I think the over/under for the group pool is 6, Master.""

""You guys started a betting pool for women I'd bed?""

""Yes, Master. The girls thought it would be an excellent idea. There's two grids that the girls made. One is number of new women and number of new girlfriends. I have 7 women and 1 new girlfriend. The other is number of orgasms given vs. received. I put that one at 30 given and 15 received.""

""You think I'm going to give 30 orgasms to 7 women this week?""

""You're a very generous lover, Master.""

Sasha murmured her agreement with that sentiment as she continued to bob up and down on my surging cock. ""How much is in the pool?""

""It's not that kind of pool, Master.""

""Huh?"" I said. The blood was rushing away from my brain and I thought I might have misunderstood.

""Well we all have pretty different income levels so we decided money wouldn't be fair to wager.""

""What did you decide?""

""The winner of the orgasm pool gets to be your plaything for a week. The other one gets to set you up on a date... I really hope I win the second one.""

I couldn't help but laugh. The idea that these girls were betting for sexual favors for me just seemed too preposterous for words. Of course, looking down at Sasha's dusky brown hair as she furiously tried to suck all of my cum from my balls reminded me I was living in the craziest timeline.

""Hrmm... which one of my sluts has the hottest group of friends with untapped potential?""

Carly frowned, ""You don't want me to win, Master?"" Her face looked sad but I could tell from her tone she was amused.

""Tell me, babe. If I wanted to have the hottest slut servicing me in the future, who do you think would do the best job of setting me up?""

""Hrmm... I don't honestly know, Master. Kyrsten or Rebeccah... oh... or Alex with all of her dancer friends. But they're not local... I guess neither are Kyrsten or Rebeccah's friends.""

""They'll be more local when we move down to Florida. Or maybe I should bet on the future. You, Kyrsten, Louise and Victoria will have to make all new friends in Florida. Who will have the hottest friends when we move down there?""

""So Victoria is coming too?""

I smiled, ""You caught that, huh?""

Carly nodded, ""That's good. I really like her. And she is head over heels for you. But to answer your question... Louise. She'll be going to school and can provide you with an endless string of eager to please coeds. Just imagine the parties we'll be having,"" she said. I did and the litany of mental images made the damn burst. I erupted without warning into Sasha's sucking mouth. She made happy, pleasant sounds as she slurped it all down, not letting any of it go to waste.

""You swallowed?"" I said. As good as her blow jobs had always been, swallowing was never her thing. She was disgusted by it. Or so she used to say.

Sasha sat up, wiping her mouth in the process and smiled a small, tight smile. ""Yes, Master. I was told I should always either swallow your cum or wear it.""

""Told by whom?"" I asked with curiosity.

""Uhmm.. Carly, Kyrsten, Louise, Sherry, Rebeccah..."" she said listing off my girls and not showing any signs of stopping.

""We're always looking out for our Master... Master."" Carly caught my eyes again in the mirror and smiled.

""Okay... then what does Louise have in the pool?""

""That's not really in keeping with the spirit of the bet, Master,"" Carly said. Her eyes sparkled in the rear view mirror and she squirmed a little.

""Does the idea of me cheating at the game, so that my girlfriend can win a bet that lets her set me up with other sluts to bed turn you on, Carly?

Carly's eyes rolled in her head and Sasha answered for her. My ex-girlfriend's voice was deep and breathy in my ear, ""It turns all of us on, Master. Do what you want to take what you want. That's all we desire.""

I slid my hand up Sasha's thigh until I felt the warmth emanating from her core. She resisted the urge to squirm towards my thick, teasing fingers. ""So tell me, Carly. What do I have to do to obligate Louise to be my little slut seeker while she's going to school?""

Carly composed herself and chuckled, ""I'm pretty sure she'd do that no matter what, Master. We all would.""

""Yeah... but I like the idea of her being required to.""

""7 girls, 2 girlfriends, Master.""

""Perfect. I'll shoot for that and if I don't get there, you'll take home the prize.""

""Mmm... No I'm going to be so torn when you're at 7 and 1, master. Whatever will my little bimbo head decide upon?"" She said the last with a sing song, vapid voice that made my cock twitch slightly. Sasha noticed and leaned down to nuzzle my cock a little more while we finished our ride to the airport.

When we arrived, it was, as always, a zoo. We got our bags and Carly gave Sasha the keys before leaning over to whisper something in my ex's ear. Sasha shuddered and blushed as her eyes flicked over to me. She smiled and nodded back to Carly who came over to join me. ""What was that all about?"" I asked as I wrapped my arm around her slender waist.

""I'll tell you if you want, Master... but I think it would be better as a surprise.""

""A sexy surprise?""

""Always, Master. You know how sneaky us Asians can be,"" she said with a playful smirk. I gave her ass a little pinch and she giggled before snuggling back into my shoulder as we walked. The rest of the airport trip and the flight were uneventful. Unfortunately, the flight was absolutely packed both on the first leg and the second. Fortunately, I was absolutely blown away by my wonderful new wife's honeymoon plans. I was a little surprised when our flights had us heading for Paris. When Carly handed me my final destination ticket that said ""SEY"" on it, my eyes bugged out a little. ""The Seychelles?"" I asked.

She nodded and smiled, ""Not just any old random Seychelles luxury resort either, Master. Only the best for you. North Island."" Her tone clearly indicated she'd know what that meant. I was baffled.

""Fill me in?""

""It's where William and Kate had their honeymoon?""

""So I'm guessing it's nice?""

""And private and only populated by super high end individuals. Only the best for my Master,"" she said the last a little too loudly and we got a funny look from a security guard. I had a momentary panic that we'd be arrested on human trafficking charges or something but Carly just giggled and waved to the man with a friendly, disarming smile.

""How much did this cost?""

""Less than you think,"" she said a little defensively as we handed our boarding passes to the attendant.

""Well... I'm thinking 50 grand.""

""Pretty close actually,"" she said, ""48 with the plane tickets. Although my new wardrobe pushed it over 50 if you make me count that.""

""You bought a whole new wardrobe... wait... you only had the one bag,"" I said in confusion.

""Of course, Master. It turns out sexy, slutty things pack very well.""

She looked at me with such a sweet, innocent expression that I had to lean over and kiss her. Our new life together was starting out almost as interestingly as our dating life had begun. We both slept on the flight from Paris to the Seychelles. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a car service that took us privately to a boat that took us out to our final destination. ""People usually take helicopters but a boat seems so much better, don't you think, Master?"" she asked me, not caring that the driver of our small seagoing vessel could hear. When she knew she had my full attention, she peeled off her shirt revealing the tiniest, sheerest bikini top I'd ever seen. It was white and nearly transparent. It barely covered her nipples but did nothing to obscure one's view of them. I momentarily forgot all plans of bedding other women and simply wanted to spend a week fucking this beautiful woman who was the love of my life. Carly's eyes twinkled knowingly before she flicked them slightly back to the boat's driver.

With all that had been happening over the last hour or so, I really hadn't even noticed. Apparently being in a tropical paradise really messes with your radar for these kinds of things because the driver was stunning. She looked young, maybe 22 or 23, with light brown skin that had been honed to a gorgeous bronze by the sun. She might have been latino or Indian, it was impossible to tell. She was wearing a tight blue polo shirt and short brown khaki shorts that showed off her gorgeous legs. She caught me looking and smiled before saying, ""You're very lucky, Sir. Is this your honeymoon?""

""That obvious?"" I said returning her smile.

""A safe guess more than an educated one, Sir. Honeymoons are about 40% of our clientele.""

""What's the other 60%?""

She shrugged, causing her small, pert breasts to rub against her shirt. I was grateful for the sunglasses I was wearing that she couldn't see my eyes flick down as I studied her. ""Bachelor and Bachelorette parties, the occasional family vacation or corporate retreat. We also get a fair bit of repeat business because people love it so much here.""

I can imagine, I said as I looked out at the gorgeous open ocean. The small town of Victoria seemed to exist almost purely to support tourists. Not surprising given how close to paradise this all seemed. I turned my attention back to Carly who sat there smugly looking at me and holding up a single finger. ""That's your first one,"" she was saying silently.

""What's your name?""

""Irene,"" our driver said over the loud roar of the speedboat's engine. ""Irene Adler.""

I raised my eyebrow, ""Like the Sherlock Holmes character?""

She laughed, ""My mom liked the character and thought nobody would ever notice.""

Her infectious laugh sounded lovely despite the competing noise, ""How's that working out?""

""It was fine for about 15 years. Rarely ever came up. Then Benedict Cumberbatch came along and suddenly everyone knows it.""

""Bummer,"" I said.

""It was right up until he came for a trip to visit last September. It was nice to have a conversation starter with someone like that.""

Carly and I busted out laughing, imagining the scene. Irene's blush indicated that maybe there was a little more to the story than she'd indicated but I didn't want to press. That was her business.

""How long have you been working here?""

""This is my first year. I wanted to have a gap year after college before going into the real world. This seemed like an amazing opportunity.""

""I bet. You probably meet all kinds of people.""

""Yes, Sir. Some of them have very interesting lifestyles,"" she said with a crooked smile as she nodded towards my wife who was sitting there watching us. She wasn't being at all subtle about her interest.

""Well we're no exception,"" I said, deciding to go with the direct route for once. Honesty being the best policy and all, ""We're hoping to have a pretty unconventional honeymoon.""

""How unconventional?"" Irene asked. She flipped her curly brown hair back to the other side of her face, giving me an unobstructed view of her beauty.

""No sex for my wife,"" I said. Carly simply smiled and nodded her agreement.

""I assume that restriction doesn't apply to you?""

""Why would it?"" I asked as I stepped just a little closer to her. I didn't want to loom over her but stood about a foot from her, drawing myself up to my full height. She was only about 5'4"" so it forced her to look up at me which she did without hesitation.

""It shouldn't, Sir. I suspect you'll find all kinds of interesting things... and people... to do here.""

""Are you the one that will show us around this week? I'd like to see more of you?""

=== PAGE BREAK ===

""I'm not but you definitely will see more of me. And Sir, feel free to engage in whatever activities you want. We pride ourselves on our discretion and... accomodation here and, as long as it doesn't bother guests, it won't bother the staff.""

""Really?"" I said as I leaned forward into her.

She sighed, her arousal obvious, ""Yes, Sir.""

""Good,"" I said then walked away from her. She actually gave a little disappointed whimper that was almost carried away by the rush of the wind. I grinned at Carly, my back to Irene and mouthed the words, ""She's definitely going to be one.""

""Hell yeah,"" Carly said with a smile. I sat down on the cushioned surface beside her and put my arm around her. We kissed, tongues dancing in each other's mouths as we made out on the boat trip. I remembered what Irene had said about the staff not being bothered by things. I wasn't sure if that was truly going to extend to all of the staff or if that was just Irene's way of giving me the greenlight with her but, regardless, I knew I could do whatever I wanted on this boat trip.

I snaked my hands down to Carly's small shorts and undid the draw string. She looked at me then spread her legs lewdly, knowing what I wanted. I reached into her pants and found her dripping gash. As I ran my finger through it, she gasped pleasantly. I started teasing and fingering her as I turned back to Irene. ""So you get a lot of kinky people here?""

Irene shifted and tried to compose herself but she couldn't stop flicking her eyes to where my hand was pleasuring my wife. Carly, for her part, wasn't making it easy. She was moaning and bucking her hips in passion, doing her best to send the clear message that I was good at giving women pleasure. I think Irene got the message. ""We definitely do, Sir. It turns out rich and famous people can be pretty kinky. But I also respect their privacy so don't expect any juicy details.""

I nodded, admiring her respect for boundaries, ""Well would you do me a couple favors?""

""Of course, Sir,"" she said perking up.

""Would you keep an ear out for anybody who visits this week who might be... interested in joining us?""

""Present company excluded?"" she said boldly.

""Definitely not. In fact, the second favor was to see if you'd join my wife and I for dinner tonight?""

She frowned, ""I can't tonight. We're checking in guests and it makes the day insane. But tomorrow night will work for me if that's alright.""

I nodded as Carly let out a shriek as if to let me know she was close to coming. I pulled my finger out and wiped her juices on the skimpy bikini top. The friction on her nipples gave her another round of shuddering and whiimpering, ""That would be great. We'll love... having you.""

It was Irene's turn to shudder now, obviously making no effort to hide her arousal anymore. She simply nodded back at us, not trusting her own voice at this point.

The rest of the trip passed in relative silence as Carly and I snuggled and quietly watched the approaching island resort. My wife had been right, it was absolutely stunning. Growing up in Florida and living in New York, I'd never seen anything like it. The water was blue and clear. The sand was white and... well... sandy but in a very different way than the beaches in Florida. The resort, if you can even call it that, was equally beautiful. Everything was absolutely perfect and I probably spent about 20 minutes with my jaw dragging on the floor in awe.

Irene helped us off the boat and got our luggage onto the golf cart sent to the docks to greet us. ""I'm headed back to the island to pick up the 5pm group,"" she told the man driving the cart for us. ""Let Danny know these two are here... I think they're in Villa 9 but maybe we should move them to 11,"" she said. The man nodded and then headed off.

""Why move us to a different villa?"" I asked, ""Something wrong with #9?""

The man coughed before carefully replying, ""Oh no, Sir. All of our villas are beautiful, hand crafted and in excellent working order. It's just that villa #9 shares an inlet with two other villas so they're a little less secluded. Villa #11 is our most isolated... uhmm... private villa, Sir.""

""Oh,"" I said and turned to Carly. We shared a laugh about our instant reputation at the resort. They'd already pegged us, probably correctly, as perverted sex fiends.

The man called into the radio, confirming the change of accomodations then zipped us over to our villa. If I thought that island was amazing, the villa put it all to shame. It was luxury incarnate. Two private pools and a hot tub, open air seating with a private section of beach. There was a huge master bedroom with food laid out waiting for us. Glass enclosed everything. ""We should make our new house like this,"" I said without really thinking about it.

""We can do that,"" Carly said as she took my arm in hers. I gave her a little kiss and handed the man a $20 for bringing us over. He looked at it a little disappointed. Clearly I needed to scale up my mental math for tipping when at a luxury resort. I watched him, just in case he decided to kick our luggage or something but he was quite professional. Once he departed, Carly and I got to unpacking. She was careful to keep me away from seeing her clothes, clearly relishing the opportunity to surprise me at every turn. She did, however, take off her shorts revealing the other half of the insanely revealing bikini. It hid nothing, just like the top. And now that both pieces were a bit damp, the top from the ocean spray and the bottoms from her obvious arousal, it was clear that they were essentially see through. I felt my cock stir.

""Are you trying to make it difficult to not fuck you this week, slut?""

She smiled at me, ""I'm just hoping to keep you aroused for your imminent conquests, Master. If it causes you to ravage me in a moment of weakness, I certainly won't complain.""

I grabbed her hair and bent her over, giving her ass cheeks two sharp smacks on each side. The redness was already obvious as she stood up, ""That's for being sassy.""

""Thank you, Master. Thank you also for marking me as yours.""

I chuckled and gave her a kiss, ""Now, let's go see if we can find someone to help me avoid fucking you.""

Carly smiled and looked over my shoulder. Before I could turn, I heard a little cough. I spun around and realized that we had company. It wasn't her fault, we'd been having our little bit of flirting in one of the open air areas of the villa. The new arrival stood there looking slightly nervous. She was a well built, busty redhead with skin that was defiantly pale despite the tropical conditions. Her fiery red hair, however, had succumbed to the sun and had an almost blonde hue to it. She was wearing the same blue polo and khaki shorts that Irene had worn but her large breasts were straining at the confines of the fabric.

""Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. I'm Lisa. I'll be your personal concierge for the week you're here. Anything you need, just let me know.""

""Groceries and stuff?"" I asked.

""If you want. Though we have an on-site chef who can cook anything you might want and deliver it.""

""Sounds great,"" I said, realizing that my stomach was rumbling. ""Maybe some stir fry?"" I asked, looking at Carly who nodded enthusiastically as she rubbed her belly. Lisa typed a message into her phone efficiently before looking up.

""Anything else?"" she asked. Something about the way she said it reminded me that she'd heard our conversation. Or at least part of it.

""Well... we were looking for one very specific thing,"" Carly said, beating me to the punch.

""Yes, Ma'am. I heard. How can I help you with that?""

""What did you hear?"" Carly asked as she walked towards the redhead. She suddenly reminded me of a predatory cat stalking a helpless deer. I remembered the first time we'd bedded a busty redhead together and I couldn't help but remember Kyrsten... at home... alone. I shook my head and tried to return to the moment as Carly circled her prey.

""I believe Mr. Simpson was... looking for some female companionship... to... uhmm... keep him distracted from you, Ma'am.""

""That's right,"" Carly said with delight as she looked at me from behind the girl's head and winked. ""Isn't that just so cruel of him. To want to fuck other sluts on our honeymoon?""

""Sl... sluts... ma'am?""

""Well sure, Lisa. Surely only a slut would fuck a married man on his honeymoon. Wouldn't you agree?""

Lisa swallowed hard. She was hard to get a read on. She clearly was interested, everything about her tone and body posture indicated that was the case. But she also seemed... not reluctant... that wasn't the right emotion. Overwhelmed. I think she wasn't expecting to get the full court press from Carly in quite this way. Her hard nipples seemed to indicate she wasn't upset by this, however. She slowly nodded then answered, ""Yes... ma'am... I guess she would have to be a slut.""

""What if she got a call from a co-worker then showed up at a married man's villa to seduce him under the pretense of being his personal concierge for the week?""

The woman's eyes widened, ""I... I...,"" she stammered.

""Oh don't you worry, slut,"" Carly said as she stroked the woman's hair from behind her. Her hands traced down Lisa's sides and pulled at the tucked in shirt hiding the two huge gems underneath. ""I read all about how the island works. People aren't assigned private concierges... are they?""

""No, ma'am.""

""So then what are you, Lisa?""

""I... I... I'm just the night manager. Irene said you two might be... interesting.""

""Uhhuh... is that all we are? Interesting? Look at him, Lisa. What word would you most use to describe him right now?"" she asked. Her fingers traced along the sides of LIsa's breasts as she worked the shirt higher.

""Delicious..."" she said wispily. Carly pulled Lisa's shirt over her head revealing a small triangle top bikini top and two large, white, beautiful tits. They were absolutely wonderful looking and I could only imagine what they felt like. Carly continued to strip the girl, teasing her with talented fingers that made the woman gasp and shake.

""He's going to fuck you. Not just today but any time he wants to for a week... understand?""

""Yes,"" she said quietly.

""I can tell you need to be used. And he'll use you just like you crave and I'll be cleaning out your cunt and taking back any of the cum you try to steal from me... got it?""

""Yes, ma'am,"" she said. It was so striking to see Carly, usually the most submissive of all my women, seducing almost to the point of domination this gorgeous creature in front of me. My cock was straining hard at my pants and Lisa was eyeing it lustily. The girl was practically panting from the teasing that Carly was hitting her with. ""And you're going to find him other pussy to fuck this week, aren't you?""

""Yes, ma'am... is.. Is he... good?""

""He's good at being bad.""

""Delicious..."" she said again almost too herself. Carly giggled from behind the girl who was now stepping out of her shorts revealing the tiny little bikini bottoms beneath.

I decided now was the time to takeover and I stepped forward. I grabbed the back of her head with a fistful of hair and kissed her forcefully. She yelped into my mouth before sinking into the kiss. Our tongues teased and explored each other. My mind drifted for a moment as I contemplated how different every woman tasted. Lisa's mouth had an almost cool freshness to it. As if she'd just drunk a bottle of ice cold water. I caught Carly's eye and she gave me a little fist bump before holding up her finger. I broke the kiss and smiled at my bride before dragging Lisa to the opulent master bedroom. ""Go sit over there and watch how I fuck this slut, lover.""

""Yes, Master,"" Carly said as she sat down in the chair I indicated. It gave her a perfect view of whatever debauchery I elected to pursue. I pulled a string on each piece of her bikini causing the two small pieces of cloth to fall open. Lisa gasped as I gripped her breasts before lowering my mouth to her obviously eager nipple. The large areolas encircled a large, thick nub that was hard and erect. I took it into my mouth, teasing her with my tongue and teeth as I listened for what seemed to most arouse her.

""Fuck that's good... Just use me, Sir. That's what I'm here for,"" she moaned huskily. I trailed my free hand down to her cunt. I was surprised by the slipperiness already there as she practically dripped into the palm of my hand. She gasped as my fingers slipped inside her. First one. Then two. Then a third. Her hips started bucking and thrusting involuntarily into my hand as my thumb lay across her clit. She humped and rubbed against it trying to get better friction.

I switched to the other breast for a moment while my hand pulled out of her cunt and played with the first nipple. I gave it a little pinch, then a twist. Then got a little more forceful as her moans of encouragement got louder. She seemed to really go crazy when I pulled on her nipples which gave me an idea. I grabbed each nipple roughly and pulled her over to the bed, leading her there and flinging her down with her hard little nubs. She practically shrieked in pleasure as I pounced down on her. Putting my body between her legs and forcing them wide. She accommodated eagerly, spreading her legs as I positioned my cock.

""Beg, slut,"" I ordered as I rubbed the cockhead along her gaping slit.

""Please... please fuck me... fucking pound me and use me and make me bow legged for a fucking weak,"" she screamed. I rewarded her by slamming into her hard. She rewarded me with a squeal of joy and locking her feet around my back. I glanced over at Carly who was sitting there watching with one hand teasing at her cunt. She blew me a little kiss and I slammed into Lisa in response. Carly licked her lips and I thrust again, harder than before. Each time Carly gave me a little encouragement, I slammed my cock deeper into the eager receptacle underneath me.

It wasn't long before Lisa called out, ""I'm cumming... fuck... I'm cumming.""

I fucked her through that first orgasm then pulled out and flipped her limp body over. I pulled her to her knees and slammed back into her hard. This time, I gripped her hair as I rode her. She seemed to revel in being manhandled and thrown around so I gripped her hips and pulled her to me, slamming her back into me instead of the other way around. When I realized my own orgasm was approaching, I turned to Carly and said, ""Get over here, slut. Get her off then clean her slut hole out.""

Carly didn't need to be told twice, she practically dove under Lisa and started licking the woman's clit. That was all it took for the redhead. She started cumming almost instantly which caused her cunt to grip me hard. I managed three more thrusts before succumbing to the pleasure and slamming into her hard as I filled her up. The teasing of the last 24 hours came to a boil and I felt like I shot a gallon of cum into her. As I pulled out, it dribbled all over Carly's face before she could attach her mouth to the woman and start sucking the thick white fluid from her cunt.

If this was the start of our honeymoon, I was sure it was going to be a good one.

Again, thanks for all the support in all the varieties you guys provide it.",,2025-08-15T18:57:33.025933,3647,3.0

By the time we left the apartment, the air had cooled into that perfect early-evening warmth--breezy, but still clinging to the heat of the day. The kind of weather that made skin feel electric.

I wore a slinky black dress Ella had loaned me. It was a little shorter than I'd normally go for, a little tighter--but after everything that had happened earlier, modesty felt almost laughable. Ella, for her part, wore a silky rust-colored slip dress that clung to her like a second skin, a silver choker resting delicately at her throat. A casual observer wouldn't have noticed it. But I knew what it meant now.

Alex looked like he always did--sharp but effortless. He carried himself like someone who already owned the room he hadn't stepped into yet. Watching them together in public--how normal they seemed, holding hands almost quaintly--was a strange kind of whiplash. If anyone passing us had any clue what we'd done together just hours earlier, they gave no sign.

The rooftop bar was just starting to fill. Music pulsed low from unseen speakers, and strings of golden light glowed overhead, casting everyone in a honey-colored haze. We grabbed a corner table with a view of the river and ordered cocktails without looking at the menu.

It was easy. Laughing, drinking, talking shit about mutual friends. For a while, we didn't acknowledge anything that had happened back at the apartment. It was like it had existed in a different dimension. I almost wondered if I'd dreamed it.

Almost.

But then I caught the way Ella sat.

Back straight. Knees close. Hands folded politely in her lap unless Alex reached for his drink--then she moved instantly to pass it to him. Not over-the-top. Just... intentional. Practiced.

And he never thanked her.

Not out loud.

His hand on her knee said enough.

By our second round, the mood had shifted.

Ella leaned against my shoulder when she laughed, her skin warm against mine. Alex's fingers were tracing little patterns over my thigh beneath the table, just light enough that it was maddening. When I looked over, he met my gaze with that same expression he always wore when I'd been caught staring--cool, steady, inviting.

""Shots?"" he said.

We didn't say no.

The liquor hit fast. Or maybe it was just the altitude. Or the way Ella's fingers had started to ghost along the back of my neck like she was tracing invisible lines only she could see.

""You two are trouble,"" I murmured, not quite looking at either of them.

""We haven't even started yet,"" Alex said.

The banter turned low and lazy. Laughter got slower, heavier. Ella let her hand rest just a little too long on my knee. When she leaned to whisper something in my ear, her lips brushed my skin--not by accident.

And then, under the table, Alex's hand slid higher.

I inhaled sharply, glancing around.

Nobody was paying attention. Everyone was too wrapped up in their own buzz, their own conversations, the skyline, the music.

""You're flushed,"" Ella whispered. Her hand joined his on my thigh, grazing just below the hem of my dress. ""Too warm?""

""A little,"" I managed.

Alex leaned in. ""Do you want to go somewhere cooler?""

I swallowed. ""Like back home?""

He smiled. ""Eventually.""

His fingers moved again. Higher. Testing.

I shivered.

Maybe no one else could see what was happening--but I could feel it. I was unraveling in public. And they were doing it together.

Ella's voice dropped to a whisper. ""How long do you think you can keep that poker face?""

Alex's hand was at the edge of my panties now. Ella's lips were grazing my shoulder.

My drink was full, but I couldn't taste it anymore.

I looked at them--both of them.

Trouble. Beautiful, patient, merciless trouble.

And I wanted to see what they'd do if I stopped pretending to behave.

Chapter 5

We didn't go home.

Not yet.

Instead, we slipped away--up a narrow, semi-hidden stairwell that led to a smaller rooftop lounge one level higher. It was quieter up there. Just a few couches, the ambient glow of string lights, and the low hum of music from below drifting up like a secret.

We weren't alone, but it felt like we were.

Ella sat between us on the cushioned bench, her dress slipping higher on her thighs with every subtle shift. Alex had one arm stretched along the back, fingers toying absently with the thin strap of her dress.

I was still catching my breath from the tension downstairs. Every nerve felt raw and too aware. I hadn't even realized how wound up I'd gotten until we sat again and the air hit my skin--cool and sharp.

That's when Ella twitched.

Just a little.

But I noticed.

A small gasp escaped her lips. She shifted in her seat, like trying to relieve pressure. Her cheeks flushed a slow, blooming pink.

""What was that?"" I asked, eyes narrowing.

Alex smirked but didn't answer.

Ella bit her lip.

""Ella,"" I said softly. ""What's going on?""

She turned to me, eyes wide, pupils huge in the low light. Her voice was barely audible.

""I'm wearing...a plug,"" she whispered.

I blinked, taking a beat to process. ""Right now?""

She nodded, trembling just slightly.

""In your...?"". She nodded again.

""She's had it in all night,"" Alex said, casually swirling his drink. ""Dinner. Cocktails. Everything.""

I looked at Ella. ""You've been walking around like this for

hours

?""

Her breath hitched again--another small, involuntary movement. ""Yes.""

Alex reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a slim black remote, and clicked something.

Ella's whole body jerked--subtly, but unmistakably.

""Oh my

God,

"" I breathed.

""She doesn't know when I'll turn it on,"" he said, tapping the button again. ""Or how long I'll leave it buzzing. Sometimes just a second. Sometimes longer. Sometimes I pretend I've forgotten I even have the remote.""

Ella let out a soft whimper and crossed her legs tightly.

""And you just... put up with it?"" I asked her, half in awe.

""I love it,"" she said, voice shaking. ""It keeps me in place. Keeps me focused.""

Alex clicked again.

This time, she gasped out loud--louder than she meant to. She covered her mouth quickly, eyes darting around the terrace.

A couple nearby looked over, then went back to their conversation.

Ella squirmed, her thighs squeezing together, a tiny whimper leaking from behind her fingers.

I leaned closer. ""Does it feel good right now?""

She nodded, unable to speak.

""Does it ache?""

Another nod. Faster this time.

""Poor thing,"" I said, starting to smile. ""You look like you're about to fall apart.""

Ella whimpered again, nodding like she was grateful just to hear it spoken aloud.

I turned to Alex. ""How long will you keep it going?""

""As long as I want,"" he said, eyes fixed on her. ""Unless you'd like to try.""

He handed me the remote.

I took it, heart pounding.

""Press the top button,"" he said. ""That's the strongest setting.""

I hesitated.

Ella's eyes locked on mine. She didn't say anything.

She didn't

have

to.

I pressed the button.

She shuddered--shoulders jerking forward, jaw clenched, hands digging into her knees as she rocked slightly.

I let it go after a few seconds, but her breathing stayed shallow.

""She's soaked,"" Alex murmured, casually tasting her on his fingers. ""She's been leaking through her panties for the last hour.""

Ella hid her face in her hands, but I could see the smile breaking through. She

loved

this. The exposure. The restraint. The helplessness.

And I loved watching her like this--unraveling at my fingertips.

""She's so easy to control,"" I whispered.

Alex looked down at her. ""Ella. Tell Emma why you wear it when we go out.""

She lifted her head slowly, breath still shaky, hands folding neatly in her lap.

""It's a rule,"" she said, voice soft and obedient. ""Any time we go out, I have to wear the plug.""

""Why?"" Alex prompted.

Her eyes flicked to mine, then back down again.

""So he can remind me,"" she said. ""Remind me who my hole belongs to.""

I exhaled--sharply. The words hit deeper than I expected.

She continued, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Even when I'm quiet. Even when I'm dressed up and smiling like everyone else. I still feel it. I always know it's

his.

""

I looked at her then--not with pity, or even shock--but with awe. With heat.

""And that turns you on?"" I asked, already knowing the answer.

She nodded. ""More than anything.""

I turned the remote in my hand, thumb hovering again over the button.

""Good,"" I said.

And I pressed it.

Ella gasped again, more breath than sound, and let her head fall onto my shoulder. Her whole body was vibrating--literally--but still composed. Barely.

Then she looked up at me, eyes glittering, and whispered, ""Come to the bathroom with me?""

Alex raised an eyebrow but didn't protest. ""Don't take too long,"" he said, not looking away from the skyline.

Ella just smiled.

We slipped inside, down the dim hallway and into the single-stall restroom. As soon as the door latched behind us, Ella leaned in and kissed me--soft, but electric.

""You're so mean,"" she whispered, grinning.

I kissed her back, harder. ""You

love

it.""

""I

do

,"" she whispered. ""But I was thinking...""

Her hands moved to the hem of her dress, hiking it up with practiced ease. She turned and bent slightly, just enough for me to see the jewel-like end of the plug between her cheeks.

""What if we gave him a surprise?""

I blinked. ""What kind of surprise?""

She looked over her shoulder at me, mischievous. ""We switch.""

My heart skipped.

""You want me to--""

""Just for a little while,"" she said, standing and kissing me again. ""He won't know. Not until he uses the remote.""

It was wild. Stupid. Hot.

""Do it,"" I said.

She bit her lip, eyes dancing, then turned around and braced her hands on the sink.

I knelt behind her, careful but swift. The plug slid out slowly. She moaned softly as it popped free.

My own heart was racing. I reached under my dress, pulling my panties down with a shaky laugh.

I laughed nervously. ""I've never had anything... you know. Back there.""

Ella tilted her head, stepping close again. ""We'll go slow. I'll help.""

Without breaking eye contact, Ella brought the plug to her lips and took the base of it into her mouth, swirling her tongue around the silicone like it was something far more obscene.

My breath caught. ""Ella--""

She pulled it out with a satisfied hum. ""Gotta make sure it's wet enough for you, babe.""

I was suddenly

very

aware of how exposed I felt. My dress clung to my thighs. My panties were damp.

She handed me a tissue. ""Just pull these down. Lean over the sink.""

My heart was hammering now, but I obeyed--slipping out of my panties, folding over the counter, bracing myself.

Ella dropped to her knees behind me. Her hands were soft on my hips, then sliding up to stroke the curve of my ass. ""You look so good like this.""

I started to laugh nervously, but then her tongue was between my thighs.

""Oh--fuck.""

She licked me slowly, deliberately, letting her tongue flick over my clit in gentle strokes. I could feel her nose almost inside of me. ""Just relax,"" she whispered between kisses. ""Let your body melt.""

And I

did.

She moved her mouth up to my asshole. My legs loosened, the tension in my lower back easing as her mouth worked me open, her fingers spreading me gently. Every flick of her tongue sent another ripple of warmth through me.

When I was panting and practically dripping, she pulled back just enough.

""Ready?""

I nodded, shaky. ""Yeah.""

She guided the plug to me, her other hand resting on my lower back. ""Breathe in.""

I did.

The pressure came slow, gentle--but insistent. I gasped, bracing harder against the sink.

""Almost there,"" she said softly. ""You're doing perfect.""

And then it slid past that last bit of resistance and settled inside.

""Oh my

God,

"" I breathed.

Ella stood, stroking my back, then kissed my shoulder.

""I feel... full.""

""Good full or bad full?""

I straightened slowly, getting used to the sensation. ""Good. Weird. But good.""

Ella knelt and gathered my panties for me, slipping them back up my legs like she was dressing a doll. I couldn't stop blushing.

""Welcome to the club,"" she said, grinning.

We checked our makeup, touched up our lip gloss, and headed back to the rooftop like nothing had happened.

Alex looked over as we slid into the booth again.

""Feeling better?"" he asked Ella.

She just smiled sweetly. ""Much.""

He raised the remote without looking, clicked it once.

The vibration lit up inside me like a struck match.

I

jumped.

Ella bit her lip to suppress a laugh.

Alex froze, eyes narrowing. He looked from her... to me.

I tried to keep my face neutral. I failed.

""You didn't--"" he started.

Ella sipped her drink with exaggerated innocence.

He looked down at the remote. ""You

did.

""

He leaned forward, voice low. ""Naughty girls.""

I tried to look contrite, but I was grinning too hard.

""You have

no

idea what you've just started,"" he murmured.

And suddenly, I couldn't

wait

to find out.

Chapter 6

The cab ride home was quiet in the way only heavy arousal can make a silence feel--charged, brimming, waiting. I sat in the back between them, warm from the drinks, warmer from the low, constant hum inside me. The plug was still in. Every bump in the road made me clench.

I didn't dare look at either of them for too long. I was already flush with heat, dizzy from how close I was to all of this unraveling again. When I felt the buzzing start again I yelped, but turned only to find the two of them making out, seemingly oblivious to me. I ached with a kind of competitive jealousy I'd never felt before.

When we got back to the apartment, Alex dropped his keys on the entryway table without a word and disappeared into the kitchen for water. I stayed in the living room, still unsure what would happen next--what

I

wanted to happen next.

Ella came up behind me, wrapping her arms around my waist. Her chin rested lightly on my shoulder.

""You were such a good girl tonight,"" she murmured, voice low and breathy. ""So brave. Letting me plug you in public...""

I laughed softly, eyes closing. ""You're not exactly shy either.""

""Mmm, no,"" she said, ""but that's different. I'm trained.""

She turned me around slowly and leaned in close. ""And now I want to watch you get wrecked.""

My heart stopped. ""What?""

Her grin was wicked. ""I want to see him fuck your ass.""

My breath caught.

""I want to watch it stretch,"" she whispered, lips brushing my cheek. ""Watch you squirm. Watch you

take

it.""

""Ella--""

""I want to see what your face looks like when he's all the way inside you.""

The rush of heat between my legs was immediate. I was too stunned to respond.

She pulled back, reading my expression. ""Too much?""

I shook my head slowly. ""No. Just... unexpected.""

She cupped my face gently. ""You can say no. Or not now. Or anything.""

But I didn't want to say no.

""I'm... curious,"" I admitted. ""And kind of wrecked already. But I want to.""

Ella's smile bloomed into something radiant. ""He's going to be so proud of me for helping you give this to him. He's always wanted it.""

She kissed me gently--no urgency, just affection--and took my hand to lead me down the hall. Alex was already there, sitting on the edge of the bed, watching us. Calm. Knowing.

""She wants to give you a present,"" Ella said sweetly, like a child bringing a drawing to show a parent. ""And so do I.""

Alex stood and came to me. ""You're sure?""

I nodded. ""Yeah.""

His hands were gentle as he helped me out of my dress, steady as ever. Ella knelt and pulled down my panties, then kissed the curve of my hip. Her hands were everywhere--soothing, grounding, warm.

Alex guided me to the bed and bent me gently over the mattress, hands running up my back. ""We'll go slow,"" he said. ""Let's get this plug out first.""

I nodded, heart racing.

Ella climbed beside me, stroking my hair. ""Breathe, baby. Relax. I'll be right here.""

Alex knelt behind me. His hands spread me, and I felt the careful tug as he eased the toy out.

I groaned softly--empty again. Exposed.

Then I felt his tongue.

He licked me slowly, between my cheeks, the flat of his tongue broad and warm and

deliberate.

""Oh my

God

,"" I whispered.

Ella giggled, kissing my shoulder. ""He's thorough.""

I moaned again when I felt his fingers--slick, testing, teasing. He worked me open gently, one finger, then two, while Ella stroked my arm and whispered sweet, filthy things in my ear.

""He's going to feel so big,"" she said. ""So deep. And you're going to take it all for us, aren't you?""

I nodded, unable to speak.

When I felt the head of his cock against me, I froze instinctively--but Ella kissed my temple and Alex whispered, ""Breathe,"" and the pressure came slow, deliberate.

And then--

He was in.

Stretching me.

Filling

me.

I gasped, tears springing to my eyes--not from pain, but from how full, how

invaded

I felt. How real it was.

He stilled. Let me adjust. Let Ella whisper how proud she was of me.

I couldn't believe it. My

friend, my former roommate, my sometimes wingman,

was inside me. Deep in my ass. Taking me in a way no one ever had.

And Ella just kept purring. ""You're such a gift,"" she whispered. ""Look at you. Letting him use you like this.""

Alex began to move--slow, firm strokes. It wasn't anything like the rough, impersonal way he had violated Ella's ass earlier. He was tender, hands delicately sliding down my back massaging. He leaned forward until his chest was pressed into my back, his cock balls deep inside of me, and softly kissed the back of my neck.

I groaned, the sensation unlike anything I'd ever felt. Intense. Overwhelming. Addictive.

Ella slid down the bed to kiss my belly, then lower, fingers teasing my clit as she looked up at me, glowing with pride.

I was past words now. Everything was heat and friction and fullness.

Alex was thrusting deeper now, more certain, more claiming. I could hear the slick sound of it, feel the way my body had given in, had

welcomed

him. The stretch no longer stung--it

thrilled.

Ella kept whispering praise between soft, maddening strokes of her fingers.

""You're so good like this,"" she said. ""So brave. Letting him in. Letting me watch.""

I moaned her name. I moaned his. I let it all go.

When Alex came, it wasn't loud. It was low, buried deep in his throat as he pushed in fully and spilled inside me, thick and hot. I gasped at the sensation, clenching instinctively around him, unable to process the intimacy of it.

He pulled out slowly, and I collapsed onto the bed, trembling, face pressed to the sheets, every inch of me open and used.

But Ella wasn't done.

I felt her move behind me, kneeling reverently. Her hands parted me, gentle but sure.

Then her tongue was on me.

I jolted. ""Ella--oh--""

She moaned softly like she'd been waiting all night for this. Her tongue moved in slow, worshipful circles. She pressed her lips to me and literally sucked up every drop of Alex's cum from my stretched hole.

""She

needs

it,"" Alex said behind me, voice almost amused. ""She can't stand to let it go to waste.""

Ella didn't answer. She just groaned, tongue dipping deeper, savoring, cleaning me with tender devotion. When she finished, she kissed the back of my thigh.

I whimpered into the mattress, too overwhelmed to move.

I reached for her hand, but discovered she had already moved on to cleaning Alex's cock. His eyes were on me while he patted her head like a pet, his still throbbing cock deep in her throat. He motioned for me over and we kissed.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

Chapter 4

By the time we left the apartment, the air had cooled into that perfect early-evening warmth--breezy, but still clinging to the heat of the day. The kind of weather that made skin feel electric.

I wore a slinky black dress Ella had loaned me. It was a little shorter than I'd normally go for, a little tighter--but after everything that had happened earlier, modesty felt almost laughable. Ella, for her part, wore a silky rust-colored slip dress that clung to her like a second skin, a silver choker resting delicately at her throat. A casual observer wouldn't have noticed it. But I knew what it meant now.

Alex looked like he always did--sharp but effortless. He carried himself like someone who already owned the room he hadn't stepped into yet. Watching them together in public--how normal they seemed, holding hands almost quaintly--was a strange kind of whiplash. If anyone passing us had any clue what we'd done together just hours earlier, they gave no sign.

The rooftop bar was just starting to fill. Music pulsed low from unseen speakers, and strings of golden light glowed overhead, casting everyone in a honey-colored haze. We grabbed a corner table with a view of the river and ordered cocktails without looking at the menu.

It was easy. Laughing, drinking, talking shit about mutual friends. For a while, we didn't acknowledge anything that had happened back at the apartment. It was like it had existed in a different dimension. I almost wondered if I'd dreamed it.

Almost.

But then I caught the way Ella sat.

Back straight. Knees close. Hands folded politely in her lap unless Alex reached for his drink--then she moved instantly to pass it to him. Not over-the-top. Just... intentional. Practiced.

And he never thanked her.

Not out loud.

His hand on her knee said enough.

By our second round, the mood had shifted.

Ella leaned against my shoulder when she laughed, her skin warm against mine. Alex's fingers were tracing little patterns over my thigh beneath the table, just light enough that it was maddening. When I looked over, he met my gaze with that same expression he always wore when I'd been caught staring--cool, steady, inviting.

""Shots?"" he said.

We didn't say no.

The liquor hit fast. Or maybe it was just the altitude. Or the way Ella's fingers had started to ghost along the back of my neck like she was tracing invisible lines only she could see.

""You two are trouble,"" I murmured, not quite looking at either of them.

""We haven't even started yet,"" Alex said.

The banter turned low and lazy. Laughter got slower, heavier. Ella let her hand rest just a little too long on my knee. When she leaned to whisper something in my ear, her lips brushed my skin--not by accident.

And then, under the table, Alex's hand slid higher.

I inhaled sharply, glancing around.

Nobody was paying attention. Everyone was too wrapped up in their own buzz, their own conversations, the skyline, the music.

""You're flushed,"" Ella whispered. Her hand joined his on my thigh, grazing just below the hem of my dress. ""Too warm?""

""A little,"" I managed.

Alex leaned in. ""Do you want to go somewhere cooler?""

I swallowed. ""Like back home?""

He smiled. ""Eventually.""

His fingers moved again. Higher. Testing.

I shivered.

Maybe no one else could see what was happening--but I could feel it. I was unraveling in public. And they were doing it together.

Ella's voice dropped to a whisper. ""How long do you think you can keep that poker face?""

Alex's hand was at the edge of my panties now. Ella's lips were grazing my shoulder.

My drink was full, but I couldn't taste it anymore.

I looked at them--both of them.

Trouble. Beautiful, patient, merciless trouble.

And I wanted to see what they'd do if I stopped pretending to behave.

Chapter 5

We didn't go home.

Not yet.

Instead, we slipped away--up a narrow, semi-hidden stairwell that led to a smaller rooftop lounge one level higher. It was quieter up there. Just a few couches, the ambient glow of string lights, and the low hum of music from below drifting up like a secret.

We weren't alone, but it felt like we were.

Ella sat between us on the cushioned bench, her dress slipping higher on her thighs with every subtle shift. Alex had one arm stretched along the back, fingers toying absently with the thin strap of her dress.

I was still catching my breath from the tension downstairs. Every nerve felt raw and too aware. I hadn't even realized how wound up I'd gotten until we sat again and the air hit my skin--cool and sharp.

That's when Ella twitched.

Just a little.

But I noticed.

A small gasp escaped her lips. She shifted in her seat, like trying to relieve pressure. Her cheeks flushed a slow, blooming pink.

""What was that?"" I asked, eyes narrowing.

Alex smirked but didn't answer.

Ella bit her lip.

""Ella,"" I said softly. ""What's going on?""

She turned to me, eyes wide, pupils huge in the low light. Her voice was barely audible.

""I'm wearing...a plug,"" she whispered.

I blinked, taking a beat to process. ""Right now?""

She nodded, trembling just slightly.

""In your...?"". She nodded again.

""She's had it in all night,"" Alex said, casually swirling his drink. ""Dinner. Cocktails. Everything.""

I looked at Ella. ""You've been walking around like this for

hours

?""

Her breath hitched again--another small, involuntary movement. ""Yes.""

Alex reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a slim black remote, and clicked something.

Ella's whole body jerked--subtly, but unmistakably.

""Oh my

God,

"" I breathed.

""She doesn't know when I'll turn it on,"" he said, tapping the button again. ""Or how long I'll leave it buzzing. Sometimes just a second. Sometimes longer. Sometimes I pretend I've forgotten I even have the remote.""

Ella let out a soft whimper and crossed her legs tightly.

""And you just... put up with it?"" I asked her, half in awe.

""I love it,"" she said, voice shaking. ""It keeps me in place. Keeps me focused.""

Alex clicked again.

This time, she gasped out loud--louder than she meant to. She covered her mouth quickly, eyes darting around the terrace.

A couple nearby looked over, then went back to their conversation.

Ella squirmed, her thighs squeezing together, a tiny whimper leaking from behind her fingers.

I leaned closer. ""Does it feel good right now?""

She nodded, unable to speak.

""Does it ache?""

Another nod. Faster this time.

""Poor thing,"" I said, starting to smile. ""You look like you're about to fall apart.""

Ella whimpered again, nodding like she was grateful just to hear it spoken aloud.

I turned to Alex. ""How long will you keep it going?""

""As long as I want,"" he said, eyes fixed on her. ""Unless you'd like to try.""

He handed me the remote.

I took it, heart pounding.

""Press the top button,"" he said. ""That's the strongest setting.""

I hesitated.

I moaned again when I felt his fingers--slick, testing, teasing. He worked me open gently, one finger, then two, while Ella stroked my arm and whispered sweet, filthy things in my ear.

""He's going to feel so big,"" she said. ""So deep. And you're going to take it all for us, aren't you?""

I nodded, unable to speak.

When I felt the head of his cock against me, I froze instinctively--but Ella kissed my temple and Alex whispered, ""Breathe,"" and the pressure came slow, deliberate.

And then--

He was in.

Stretching me.

Filling

me.

I gasped, tears springing to my eyes--not from pain, but from how full, how

invaded

I felt. How real it was.

He stilled. Let me adjust. Let Ella whisper how proud she was of me.

I couldn't believe it. My

friend, my former roommate, my sometimes wingman,

was inside me. Deep in my ass. Taking me in a way no one ever had.

And Ella just kept purring. ""You're such a gift,"" she whispered. ""Look at you. Letting him use you like this.""

Alex began to move--slow, firm strokes. It wasn't anything like the rough, impersonal way he had violated Ella's ass earlier. He was tender, hands delicately sliding down my back massaging. He leaned forward until his chest was pressed into my back, his cock balls deep inside of me, and softly kissed the back of my neck.

I groaned, the sensation unlike anything I'd ever felt. Intense. Overwhelming. Addictive.

Ella slid down the bed to kiss my belly, then lower, fingers teasing my clit as she looked up at me, glowing with pride.

I was past words now. Everything was heat and friction and fullness.

Alex was thrusting deeper now, more certain, more claiming. I could hear the slick sound of it, feel the way my body had given in, had

welcomed

him. The stretch no longer stung--it

thrilled.

Ella kept whispering praise between soft, maddening strokes of her fingers.

""You're so good like this,"" she said. ""So brave. Letting him in. Letting me watch.""

I moaned her name. I moaned his. I let it all go.

When Alex came, it wasn't loud. It was low, buried deep in his throat as he pushed in fully and spilled inside me, thick and hot. I gasped at the sensation, clenching instinctively around him, unable to process the intimacy of it.

He pulled out slowly, and I collapsed onto the bed, trembling, face pressed to the sheets, every inch of me open and used.

But Ella wasn't done.

I felt her move behind me, kneeling reverently. Her hands parted me, gentle but sure.

Then her tongue was on me.

I jolted. ""Ella--oh--""

She moaned softly like she'd been waiting all night for this. Her tongue moved in slow, worshipful circles. She pressed her lips to me and literally sucked up every drop of Alex's cum from my stretched hole.

""She

needs

it,"" Alex said behind me, voice almost amused. ""She can't stand to let it go to waste.""

Ella didn't answer. She just groaned, tongue dipping deeper, savoring, cleaning me with tender devotion. When she finished, she kissed the back of my thigh.

I whimpered into the mattress, too overwhelmed to move.

I reached for her hand, but discovered she had already moved on to cleaning Alex's cock. His eyes were on me while he patted her head like a pet, his still throbbing cock deep in her throat. He motioned for me over and we kissed.",,2025-08-15T18:58:06.835960,3401,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/wife-gives-coed-to-hubby-for-b-day,Wife gives Coed to Hubby for B-Day,Unknown Author,,,,,"Characters: Chad the husband. 6' 1"", well taken care of, light hair and owner of a successful construction business.

Melinda the wife. 5' 7"", dark wavy hair, a very toned figure topped by 32 C boobs that not only defied gravity but were the host to seemingly permanently hard nipples. CFO of the restaurant this tale opens up in.

Jennifer, 23yo bartender at Melinda's restaurant. 5' 1"" blonde with 34 D boobs that seemed even bigger on her otherwise tiny frame.

""Ummm, honey there's someone under our dinner table unzipping my pants, you know anything about that?""

Looking me dead in the eyes, my wife watches me for a moment, looks around our quiet corner of the restaurant and responds with ""I do dear, I assume you remember Jennifer the hotty bartender?""

My answer was stifled by the feeling of warm lips engulfing my cock, but I did indeed remember Jennifer. In fact the last time I was at this restaurant I had ordered my drink from her and she responded with ""Yes Daddy"" before fluttering her eyelashes and grabbing a bottle of Bourbon. I was unexplainably hard for the rest of the evening.

My wife continued to watch me as I nodded a yes to her earlier question.

""I love the torment, I know you want to cum in our little friend's mouth, but you also want to continue enjoying her efforts.""

Malinda was right, the enthusiastic mouth that currently engulfed my very hard cock felt heavenly and I was indeed getting close to cumming.

I was startled out of my reverie as the waitress asked if we'd like a second round of drinks.

I croaked a yes trying to not sound like there was a twenty something hotty hidden under the floor length tablecloth trying to suck my soul out through my cock.

The waitress wiggled away and my wife leaned in ""you should cum in her mouth before the waitress gets back, I bet Jennifer swallows your entire load""

That was Jennifer's cue to swirl her soft tongue across the sensitive underside of my dick.

""Happy birthday baby, she's yours for the night""

My eyes went wide as my cock hit the back of Jen's throat and I tried not to get loud as I pumped a load of cum into her enthusiastic mouth.

Malinda smiled a devilish grin as my eyes momentarily rolled back in my head.

My softening cock was carefully placed back into my pants and the zipper returned to its original state as my wife continued with her demonic smile.

""OK, Jennifer, the coast is clear, slide out and we'll meet you at the house later tonight""

The tablecloth swept open and Jennifer wiggled out from her hiding spot, winked at me and strutted out the back door of the restaurant.

""She's really fucking hot, isn't she?""

I was clearly caught watching Jennifer's poetic exit, but it seemed my wife shared my appreciation for her gorgeous curves.

Before I could speak, dinner arrived and my wife and I ate at an inappropriately quick pace, probably not really enjoying what was undoubtedly a lovely meal.

""You're hard to shop for, I feel like if you want something you go and get it, but I doubt you'd ever buy yourself a twenty three year old busty blond, so I took a chance, do you like my present?""

She asked as if the answer could go either way and punctuated the question by biting her lip and twirling her hair.

""I love the gift honey, certainly something I would never have purchased for myself, are you ok with this present?"" I asked, still a little concerned about adding a person to our bedroom antics.

""I'm very OK, with this gift, and I do hope you'll share?""

And there it was, I was getting hard again and knew dinner would need to be over very soon. We had done our fair share of kinky things, bondage, anal, toys (remote control vibe is a fan favorite) and even shared fantasies of adding partners, but I never imaged that one cold really happen.

Melinda smiled, knowing damn well what my answer would be and waving to our server for the check.

By the time we reached the car, we were kissing like teenagers, my hands all over her body and not so quiet moans escaping her mouth. She had neglected to wear underwear and it was not long before I had two fingers in her soaked pussy.

""Unggg, shit, I'm so wet. I can't wait to watch you fuck her, you should pound her from behind, she's young and flexible and told me she likes it a little rough,""

Melinda's eyes rolled back as she closed in on a much deserved orgasm.

""Cum for me baby, right here in the parking garage, pushed up against my car, teetering on slutty heels, I know you want to cum""

""Yes, yes, yesssssss....""

Melinda's full weight pushed against my hand as the rest of her body flopped into mine and I could feel her ragged breathing on my neck.

""We should go, before we get arrested."" I encouraged as I opened the door and let her nearly limp body ease into the passenger seat.

We pulled out of the parking garage and were home in twenty minutes. I'd never seen Melinda so worked up and during the drive, she alternated between rubbing my cock through my pants and showing me how she could put a finger on either side of her clit and make it extend even further.

Not entirely sure how we did not end up in a ditch. I pulled into the garage and hit the remote to close it before taking a very deep breath. I was liking the look of turning forty two and certainly the look of my 5' 7"" wavy brunette wife as she extracted herself from the car and strutted into the house.

""Jennifer, we're home, can you bring us some drinks?""

I followed closely as my wife requested beverages as if this were a common occurrence.

Jennifer appeared shortly after, ankle strapped stilettos clicking along the tile, a tiny skirt instead of the jeans I had seen her in last and a barely buttoned blouse that dared you to peak in and see her nipples. The topper was a 2"" thick leather collar that sported a large D ring and was bedazzled with the words Fuck Me across it.

""Hello Chad, hello Melinda. I was starting to get lonely"". Shared Jennifer as she handed us our drinks, having clearly made them before we arrived. It was starting to feel like Malinda and Jennifer had done some serious planning.

We both took hard swigs as Jennifer watched us and I wondered what was to happen next.

""Did you like my husband cumming in your mouth?""

Melinda broke the tension with a whopper of a conversational hammer.

""I did, his cock is the perfect size. Enough to own my mouth, make me gag a little, but not kill me. He was nearly in my throat when he came, did you enjoy that Chad? Did I do a good job sucking you off in the restaurant?""

I could probably cut diamonds with my cock at this point and to make matters worse Melinda pulled Jen in for a long hard kiss while feeling up her boobs. I stripped and sat in a chair to watch the unexpected girl on girl action,

""I see why men love big boobs, they feel amazing, Jennifer just moaned as my wife pulled at her hard nipples.

""I'm sorry to hog your gift honey, but she's just so beautiful. Are you ready to fuck our little hotty while your devoted wife watches?""

At this point they had also stripped, my wife had several fingers inside Jennifer and both women had their eyes closed, mouths open and moaning. Fuck this was hot.

My wife paused the action. ""I have a present for your present, Jennifer, why don't you lay over my husband's lap and let him feel your big ol boobs on his cock.

Jennifer complied and her warm, soft tits were soon grinding against my hard cock while she spread her own ass cheeks for my wife.

""Our little friend has never had a cock up her ass, so I told her we'd go slow, does the plug feel good baby? Do you like the feeling of something in your tight little ass?""

I watched as my wife concentrated on shoving a heavily lubed plug up this woman's ass. Jennifer's blond hair swung back and forth across her back, her boobs pushed into my cock and she moaned louder than any woman I've ever heard.

""I think she likes something in her ass, baby, listen to her, she can't get enough of this""

I couldn't take it anymore and grabbed a handful of Jennifer's hair, picked her up and threw her on the bed. Her body had barely settled in before I had my dick in her tight pussy. I could feel the plug on my nuts each time I bottomed out in her young pussy.

Jennifer's legs were wrapped around me as I pounded my cock into my forty second birthday present. Her hips arched up as she came.again and again. Each time she moaned a breathy ""thank you daddy"" into my ear.

At this point I'm not sure where Melinda was, although I could hear the buzz of a vibrator and her soft moaning somewhere in the room..

Jennifer screamed again and started begging ""I can't come again, I'm too sensitive, please give me a break, let me suck your cock.""

I pulled out to give her a break and she laid next to me panting wildly.

""Fuck Melinda, I haven't cum that many times in my entire life. How has he not killed you?""

Melinda responded with a long, loud moan that I knew was her cumming on her toy.

We all laid still for a moment catching our breath.

""I want to see it baby, I want to see you cum in her little ass""

With that Jennifer rolled over and slid her legs up. Pushing her pert ass up in the air while keeping her face buried in the sheets.

""Happy Birthday, but go slow Chad, I've never had a cock in my ass.""

Melinda came over and eased the plug out of her butt. Jennifer groaned as my wife reached over and kissed me hard on the lips while rubbing lube on my ridgid cock. I was still struggling to believe my gorgeous wife was helping me fuck this coed in the ass.

""Get ready Jen, my husband is going to put his dick in your ass, fuck you silly and probably cum up your butt""

Jennifer answered by wiggling her hips.

I repositioned myself behind her upraised ass and put the tip of my dick against her freshly lubed ass. My wife smiled at me and immediately looked down at my cock as I started to ease it in Jen's ass.

""Oh fuck, that's huge, oh god please go slow. Oh my god, there's a cock in my ass""

Melinda's mouth was soon on mine as I let Jennifer get used to the first few inches of cock.

""This is so hot, do you like a cock in your ass Jen? You look so fucking sexy taking my husbands dick in your ass""

Jen just moaned into the bed as I bottomed out in her butt.

""Fuuuuuck, I'm cumming, I'm cumming with a dick in my ass, god that's so slutty""

Melinda pulled her mouth off mine ""Cum in her ass baby, fill up her little tight with your cum""

That was it, I slammed my hips into Jennifer, throwing my head back and cumming hard enough that I was concerned I may not make it to see my forty third birthday, but not really caring.

The bed was soon a puddle of warm bodies, and the room filled with the sounds of heavy breathing before we all passed out.

I woke up to the sun peaking through the gap in the curtains and a warm mouth on my cock.

Melinda walked into the bedroom and smiled. ""Happy birthday baby, did you have fun last night?""

I could only moan as my dick hit the back of Jen's throat and her fingernails dragged across my taint.

Melinda pulled up a chair, sipped her coffee and played with her clit, never losing eye contact with me as I pumped whatever cum I had left down Jennifer's throat.

""She's good, isn't she? Look at her swallowing your cum like a pro. Can I have her when you're done?""

I could only nod as my balls contracted one last time and Jennifer pulled away licking her lips and wiping the last drop of cum off her face.

""Fun way to wake up, huh? I better finish off your wife before I go"" And with that she got off the bed and knelt in front of Melinda, pushing her face between her legs and forcing a guttural groan from my wife.

""Oh fuck baby, she's licking my clit, I've never had a woman touch me before, god this is hot. Fuck, she's making me cum. Oh god ahhhhhhh""

Melinda's hair flung back, her eyes rolled back in her head as she grabbed Jen's hair forcing her head into her pussy and making sounds I'm not sure I've ever heard from her as she pumped her pussy into Jennifer's face and through several orgasms.

We both laid back as Jennifer grabbed her clothes and kissed us both goodbye.

""Happy birthday Chad, thank you for taking my anal cherry"" and she blew me a kiss before walking out of our house.

Melinda looks at me and mouthed happy birthday before leaning over and kissing me with a brutal passion.

""How did you talk her into doing this?"" I wandered aloud.

""Jennifer finished up school last month, quit last week and is heading to a new job in Florida. She needed a deposit for an apartment, so we came to an arrangement. She's had a crush on you for the last two years so it wasn't too difficult to make it happen.""

""Wow... So what do you want for your birthday?"" I asked with a bit of trepidation.

""Well, Jen is back in town in October for her sister's wedding,I want what you had, except she stays focused on my pussy the whole weekend and maybe we add handcuffs to keep it interesting. Think you can handle that?""

Did not see that one coming, but there was no chance I would have ever said no to seeing Jen back in our home.

Stay tuned for Melinda's bondage birthday. I'm kinda wondering who gets tied up, but I suspect it'll be good no matter what.",,2025-08-15T18:58:40.555968,2482,

As I hobbled out of the doctor's office, I was in a daze. I wondered to myself how I would manage six months of bedrest that was the mandatory recuperation time for the surgery my doctor promised would finally end the excruciating back pain I had been suffering for the past year. At 42, I had been an active, happily married personal trainer before the accident that changed my life. I knew that this surgery was necessary for me to regain some semblance of the great life I knew was still within my reach. I hadn't worked one day since the equipment malfunction ended my career one year ago last week. I was mentally beginning to make some of the arrangements necessary for me in to get back to the land of the living. My spirits were starting to lift a bit!

I kept these thoughts to myself as my husband settled me back into the bed at home. He was in a bit of a rush to get back to work, so he kissed me and said, ""We'll discuss this later. Try not to worry, babe. Everything is going to be fine! You are going to get better soon! I love you!""

My name is Jillian Rossan and my husband Thomas and I have been very happily married for sixteen years. He is six years older than me, a professor of literature at our local university and quite possible the most handsome man I've ever seen! I fell in love with him when he came to my gym for a training session and have never wavered in that feeling for one moment since. We were married eight months after meeting and fall more in love every single day. He's 6'2"" of broad shouldered, blond haired, blue eyed, well built, masculine perfection. It's not just my opinion either; most women who meet him get some form of a crush on him, from minor to very, very major. He is faithful and has never once given me reason to mistrust him. I'm extremely fortunate to be married to such a loyal and loving man, especially considering the fact that he's surrounded by fawning nubile coeds all day long.

At 5'7"", 120 lbs. with long dark wavy hair, lots of curves and firm 36 D's, I attract my share of attention, too. But many men with attractive women by their side stray. My husband constantly remarks how fortunate he is to have a wife who is not only beautiful, but quite passionate, too. We are well matched in terms of our libido and our sex life, pre-accident, was very active. We were accustomed, even after 15 years of marriage, to some form of sexual activity at least once a day. Then this accident changed everything. I have been in too much pain to feel sexually motivated and he, of course, is too kind to push the issue. I've taken care of his needs (ugh! I hate even saying it that way, but that's the way it is) by giving him hand jobs and even what passes as a blow job now and then, but it isn't the same. He never complains and, in fact, reports that he's quite content and just wants me to get better. It hurts him to see me in such pain and he is willing to do whatever it takes to help me improve. Being a very close couple, we've spoken openly about these issues on numerous occasions.

When he arrived home from work that evening, I had a nice dinner, delivered from our local restaurant, warming in the oven and some nice music playing in the background. We had to discuss details of what would happen during my convalescence. Perhaps it shouldn't have surprised me when he said that he had already contacted my doctor's office and received a list of qualified nurses to assist at home during my recovery. In addition, he posted a notice at his school's nursing program requesting any student interested in earning additional income by working as my personal care assistant during this period of time to contact him. He would conduct interviews and then have me involved in the final selection process. I felt such a tremendous rush of love for him and a sense of relief at the same time. I was so accustomed to be the one taking care of everyone that it was unusual for me in this position. I knew I had to get used to being taken care of temporarily!

Over the next few weeks, we interviewed several people and settled on an RN and a girl from the school to assist with all personal, non-medical needs. It was beginning to look like this could really happen and I was very happy! Thomas and I both felt as if our life would eventually return to normal.

The surgery was a success, but the recovery, as expected, was grueling. Having Linda, the RN we hired, at the house, was a tremendous help in the days after the procedure. She was competent and capable. As I recovered, she came to the house less often. Rachel, the young lady we hired to assist in the non-medical issues, became more important in our lives. At 21, she was a student in the nursing program so Thomas could not vouch for her as she was never one of his students. We checked her references and all were wonderful, so we were satisfied. Thomas arranged for her to be a live-in and she was there when I arrived home from the hospital. Fortunately, she fit into our lives easily. My surgery took place over the summer, so she was not taking classes and had plenty of time on her hands. Thomas was teaching summer classes, but his schedule was lighter than normal so he had more time to spend at home, too. I was anything but lonely during my recovery period!

Rachel and I became fast friends. It was great to have someone with knowledge of medical issues. She was also very high energy, kind and genuinely wanted to help. I liked the fact that she was into fitness. At her age, it was easier to keep fit, but she and I had a lot of discussions about what exercises worked best and it helped me to feel as if I my expertise was not going to waste. She didn't need to lose weight or get in shape. Trust me, Rachel was in perfect shape. This girl had a nearly perfect body! She was 5'1"", 100 lbs. with 32 C's. To give you the full picture, her long dark red hair hung down to her waist, she had the prettiest green eyes and her skin was alabaster. I could tell that appearances were important her. She and I went through my work out clothing and I loaned her some of my outfits for her exercises.

I also noticed during this time that Thomas and Rachel were become fast friends. In the mornings, I liked to sleep in as I often had great difficulty sleeping at night. Thomas and Rachel often went running together and then come back for showers. After showers, Rachel would come in and prep me for the day. We would all have a light breakfast of fruit and juice together and we would get on with our day, Thomas went off to school and Rachel and I would begin whatever we were up to that day. Some days, when there was no school, Thomas spent the day at home with us. After about three weeks of this, I noticed that Rachel seemed to be flirting a bit with Thomas.

Since my surgery, Thomas and I had maintained our routine of hand jobs and sometimes, when I had a really good day, a blow job. He seemed very horny lately, I must admit. It was still inconceivable for me to think about resuming intercourse due to the pain, but I wanted very much to see that he was satisfied. I insisted on the hand jobs or Thomas would have been happy to take care of himself when the need arose. I had a lot of time on my hands these days and suddenly an idea came to me! If Rachel was flirting with Thomas, I wondered if he was attracted to her. If I could confirm my suspicions (because what man wouldn't be attracted to her?), I might be able to use her flirtations to my advantage. I knew Thomas had to be bored with the hand jobs and I thought I might be able to spice them up a bit! I'm sure having cute little Rachel around all the time contributed to the increase in his libido.

I knew from our endless hours of discussion, that Rachel had recently broken up with her latest boyfriend. I also knew that she was attracted to older men. We openly discussed her flirtations with some of her teachers at school. I told her about some of the girls that had come on to Thomas and how faithful he was, but I also let her know that I was not at all jealous. In fact, I told Rachel that having her around the house was great for both of us and that I welcomed her flirtations with Thomas because of my limitations.

She blushed as she admitted that she often wondered if she was being too obvious about her attraction toward him. When I assured her that it was perfectly natural, we discussed the parameters. I had absolutely no problems with my husband's ego being stroked, but I was not sure I was prepared for anything physical to occur. I encouraged her to continue on as she had been and let her know that we would all openly discuss the ""rules"" for this as we went along. As long as we kept it in check and she realized that my husband and I were very much in love and this was just for fun, we should have no problem. Rachel thanked me for opening up this topic and said that she had been feeling very guilty for her attraction toward Thomas, but now realized that it was natural. She could see how very much in love we are and stressed that she had no desire to ever come between us as she truly was growing to love us both.

The next morning was a Saturday, so there was no rush to get ready for school. When Thomas and Rachel came back from their run, I asked him to come back to bed after his shower. He immediately agreed. He came to bed with nothing on and I began to caress him. As I ran my hands over his beautiful body, I asked him about his run. He said that it went well. I asked him, casually, what Rachel wore when they ran, as I stroked his long hard cock. He began to describe to me, in minute detail, the tight pink workout bra that he could see through her tight white shirt and the very short black shorts she had on. As he spoke, his voice took on a very far away quality and I could tell he was watching her run ahead of him in his mind.

""Thomas, tell me how Rachel's ass looked in those tight shorts,"" I breathed in his ear.

""Oh, babe, that ass is amazing. It is so tight. Her buns are so high and when she runs you can see just a bit of her naked ass peeking out,"" he moaned.

I continued to stroke him slowly and felt the pre-cum leaking out of his hard, throbbing cock. I moaned back, ""Um, baby, I bet she looks so hot. She runs a little ahead of you, doesn't she? She wants you to get a glimpse of her bare ass under those short running shorts, doesn't she?""

""Oh, please. I need to cum so badly. I don't think she knows that I'm staring at her gorgeous ass. She's so beautiful, babe. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be looking at her, should I? I've been jerking off in the shower every day after we get back, but this is so much better. I love to feel your hands on my cock, Jillian. I love you!"" he whispered.

""Thomas, I want you to look at her. I want you to fantasize about what it would be like to touch that beautiful body. She wants you, baby. You know it. I know it. She flirts with you outrageously. She dresses like that in front of you to turn you on. She knows we can't have sex and yet she flaunts her sexy body in front of you, sweetheart. You are a very attractive man. I understand that she wants to tease you and play with you. I'm not upset, baby. You should flirt with her. You deserve a little playing around now and then. Just no sex, baby. Flirting and playing are okay, but you can't penetrate her. Okay?"" I moaned.

I felt myself getting turned on as he moaned, ""Oh, no! Baby, are you serious?"" His cock was leaking profusely and he was thrusting into my hand. In all the time I had been giving him hand jobs, I had never seen him this horny. Just introducing open discussion about Rachel and giving him permission to flirt with her had opened up a whole new world for him. It made me so happy to see him excited for the first time in over a year, truly excited. He erupted in my hand and I felt his cock throb for what felt like an eternity. It was amazing for both of us!

I whispered in desperation, ""Get my toy box. I need you to make me cum. Get my vibrator and make me cum, quickly! I am really, really horny!""

Thomas reached under the bed, grabbed my vibrator (luckily the batteries still worked!) and he placed it on my dripping clit and in mere seconds I began to have multiple orgasms. The thought of Rachel and Thomas flirting and playing turned me on very, very much. In my mind, I pictured the two of them touching, playing and kissing each other. I felt like I couldn't stop cumming! For some reason, thoughts of the two of them together turned me on very, very much!

Maybe we were coming back. The extra excitement cost me in terms of additional pain later in the day, but I took a pain pill, stayed in bed and was not sorry for the experience. It was well worth it. My husband walked...scratch that...strutted around for the rest of the day.

https://www.literotica.com/s/my-naive-boyfriend-ch-02,My Naive Boyfriend Ch. 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"It was a few months before I had any more trouble with Clara. Well, I was pretty sure she and David were still sending nude pics to each other regularly. He'd changed his phone notifications so that picture previews would no longer appear, so I wasn't sure exactly what they were texting each other. But they were texting each other quite a lot. I figured if it was just pictures, though, there wasn't much to get upset about. I mean, he could find pictures of naked women all over the internet, I just happened to know the woman they belonged to. Plus, he was much hornier all the time, and I was hardly one to complain about my boyfriend pounding the hell out of me every night.

All that changed, though, when Clara started her massage class. She bugged David to let her practice on him, and at first he resisted. He may be naive, but I think some part of him realized that being alone with her while she rubbed his half-naked body was probably not the best idea. She eventually suggested that I come along and get a massage too, and that sealed it. I could be there to make sure no lines were crossed as well as get a massage of my own.

When we arrived at Clara's apartment, though, she had just started giving our other friend Bridget a massage. The massage bed was set up in the living room, and Bridget lay on it underneath a towel that covered her from her otherwise bare shoulders to the middle of her thick thighs. Acres of her tanned, naked legs stretched out to the end of the table. It was funny seeing Clara hunched over her, because while Clara is a petite, pale redhead, Bridget is a tan, brunette Amazon. Clara was smoking hot, but Bridget oozed more matronly sensuality. She was taller than me, almost as tall as David in fact, with a pear-shaped body. Her thin chest supported medium-sized boobs. Her stomach was mostly flat, and then her hips flared out into a wide booty and thick, succulent thighs. The towel did little to hide the substantial hill of her butt, just like the yoga pants and skinny jeans she typically wore.

David and I said hi as we entered, and Clara immediately ran to David, her large, round breasts bouncing unsupported underneath her thin tank top. She leapt into his arms and wrapped her smooth, pale legs around his waist as she hugged him tightly, pressing her chest tightly into his. She grabbed his head and kissed him on the cheek, though it looked like it was more on the corner of his mouth. Then she dropped down and gave me a light hug. Bridget waved from the massage bed, saying she was only in panties underneath the towel, so couldn't get up to hug us.

David and I took seats on the living room couch. Clara joked that David probably didn't want to hear all of their girl talk and turned the tv to a basketball game. I couldn't stand watching sports, but I was glad he would at least be distracted from the sight of Clara, in a tank top and tight shorts, rubbing the half-naked Bridget. We had a direct side-view of the table and could see Bridget's stunning, curvy silhouette under the towel, but as long as she stayed mostly covered, I thought the basketball game would keep David occupied.

It worked, at first, as Clara massaged Bridget's shoulders and neck, but then she rolled the towel back down to Bridget's waist. Her entire naked back was on display, and as Clara started rubbing oil into it, I snuck a peek at David and saw him intensely watching the proceedings. Bridget's boobs weren't the size of Clara's, but they were bigger than mine and definitely a good handful, which caused them to bulge out from her sides where they were pressed into the table. She cooed and moaned softly as Clara worked on her back, and I could feel David squirming in his seat next to me.

Clara finished massaging Bridget's back and moved down to her legs. Her thighs jiggled and swayed as Clara rubbed and shook the immense amount of flesh on display. I could see David watching out of the corner of my eye, and I wanted to chastise him, but didn't want to call him a pervert in front of the other girls. I really thought he and I would be together long-term, so didn't want them thinking he was a gross, leering weirdo. I reminded myself to talk to him when we got back home.

""Ok,"" Clara said, finishing up her legs. ""I'll have to do your butt.""

Bridget giggled and said ok and Clara grabbed the towel and pulled it off her body. We got a momentary side view of Bridget's prone, naked body interrupted only by the thin band of her panties stretching across her hip. Then, Bridget shrieked and grabbed for the towel, momentarily lifting her chest up off the table and showing us one bare breast capped by a hard, pink nipple, before flopping back onto the table. She struggled to throw the towel back over herself.

""What are you doing?!"" Clara said between laughs.

""You're showing David my panties!"" Bridget said.

""He doesn't care,"" Clara said. ""Plus, your panties will have to come off.""

""What?!""

""For the full experience,"" Clara continued, grasping the sides of Bridget's panties. ""Trust me, it's worth it.""

""But they'll see me!"" Bridget said.

""You're such a prude,"" Clara said. She grabbed the towel from Bridget and bunched it up on the side of the table between Bridget's butt and us. ""There, now they won't be able to see anything.""

She was right. Seated on the side like we were, the pile of towel blocked our view of her from her waist to the top of her thighs.

""Fine,"" Bridget said, then rolled her head to face us. ""No getting up to go to the bathroom though, you two!""

Clara pulled Bridget's panties down her legs and off her body. I could hear David gulp next to me. We couldn't see any of her private parts, but the knowledge that Bridget lay there completely naked and exposed weighed heavily in the air. Clara drizzled oil across her large, soft cheeks and massaged it in.

""Just to warn you,"" Clara said. ""I'm about to do something that's not part of normal massages.""

""What,"" Bridget said. ""Undress me in front of our friends?"" We all laughed.

""Very funny,"" Clara said. ""But no. My teacher is one of the foremost advocates of sphincter massage.""

""My butthole?!"" Bridget shrieked. Clara said yes. She then went into a long explanation of how humans keep tension in every muscle, especially in our cores. That included our anuses, which can be incredibly tight, but due to shyness, almost never get massaged.

""So you're just gonna rub up and down my crack?"" Bridget asked.

""That's how we'll start, yes,"" Clara said, and made her first pass across Bridget's rear entrance. I couldn't see, of course, but yelp Bridget let out could only mean one thing. Clara shushed her and did it again, and this time Bridget stiffened, but didn't yelp.

""See? So much tension,"" Clara said as she continued rubbing. Bridget soon started emitting the soft coos and moans she had during the best parts of the massage.

""I can see what you mean,"" Bridget said. ""That actually feels really good now.""

""Good,"" Clara said. ""Then you're ready for the second part."" She stopped rubbing and pressed her hand forward into Bridget. Bridget shrieked loudly and lifted her chest off the table, giving us another view of her quivering breasts as they hung from her chest.

""What are you doing?!"" Bridget said.

""This is the second part of the sphincter massage,"" Clara said.

""You're fingering my butthole!"" Bridget protested, then realized she was baring her chest for us and flopped back onto the bed.

""It'll start to feel really good again,"" Clara said. ""Just give it a moment.""

David and I watched from the couch as Clara sawed her finger in and out of Bridget's anus. Clara was right and soon Bridget's grunts turned into soft moans. I swore I could even see Bridget pressing her ass back into Clara's fingers, though I couldn't be sure.

""You're right,"" Bridget cooed. ""That feels wonderful.""

""The first time my teacher did it to me, I almost came,"" Clara said.

""I can see why,"" Bridget said, before turning her face to David and I. ""Oh, sorry guys.""

""Don't worry,"" David said. ""Just enjoy yourself.""

""Yeah it really is wonderful,"" Clara said. ""I wish someone could give me one everyday."" Bridget moaned in agreement.

It was over a minute later, and Clara went to wash her hands in the kitchen. When she came back, she told Bridget to roll over.

""Ok, will you hold up the towel?"" Bridget asked.

""What for?"" Clara said.

""Uh, my boobs?"" Bridget said. Clara shrugged. ""David's here?""

""He's seen boobs before,"" Clara said.

""Yeah, but not mine,"" Bridget said. She must not have realized she flashed us twice already, though rolling over for the remainder of the massage would certainly be different from a quick flash.

""Oh, he doesn't care,"" Clara said. ""He and I have been trading nude pics for a couple months now.""

I froze. I didn't want my other girl friends knowing what she and David had been up to, but I guess that cat was out of the bag now.

""What, really?"" Bridget said. ""You're so naughty. Natalie, you're okay with this?""

I just shrugged. I'd come to terms with it, but didn't want to explain myself to my friend.

""Well I don't see why you sending him pics of your tits means I need to be naked in front of him,"" Bridget said.

""Fine,"" Clara said. ""If you're so shy, then I'll join you."" Before any of us could respond, she grabbed the bottom of her tank top and pulled it over head. Her huge tits, capped with hard, light pink nipples popped into view and bounced around as she pulled the tank top off her arms and threw it to the ground.

""Good god, girl,"" Bridget said. ""Fine. He'll be distracted by your huge knockers anyway."" And with that, she rolled over. The towel was still piled at her side, and her hips were so wide, that we got a good view of one oiled buttcheek and her naked buttcrack as she rolled over. Then she lay back down, her breasts falling back somewhat into her chest, but still sticking up off her body slightly. Her nipples were as hard as Clara's.

If it weren't for the loud basketball game in the background, you'd be able to hear a pin drop as Clara started massaging Bridget's shoulders. Clara's tits hung away from her body as she leaned over the table and shook back and forth as she rubbed Bridget's flesh. After a moment, she moved on to Bridget's chest. Well, her breasts to be more accurate. After covering her top half in oil, she rubbed and squeezed Bridget's chest, eliciting more soft moans and giggles from the prone girl.

After that, Clara massaged Bridget's tummy briefly before moving down to her thighs, then legs. I expected Clara to start talking about the benefits of experimental labia massage, but after she was done with Bridget's feet, she declared the massage over. Bridget thanked her and pulled the towel over her front before sliding off the far side of the table and wrapping the towel around her.

""Which one of you is next?"" Clara said, pointing at me and David. I thought she'd put her shirt back on now that Bridget was covered, but she just stood there, hands on her hips, her eyes and bare breasts staring straight at us.

""Me!"" David said, jumping up and walking to the table. His crotch passed right by my eye level and I could see his big dick was rock hard inside his jeans. Bridget took his place on the sofa next to me, still only wearing the towel.

""Ok, get undressed and I'll get another towel,"" Clara said, disappearing into the hallway. David took off his shirt and jeans, then stood waiting as Bridget and I stared at his tight, hard butt in his boxer briefs.

""All I could find was this one,"" Clara said, returning with a small hand towel. ""But luckily we won't have to worry about your boobs.""

""Should I take these off?"" David asked, pointing to his underwear. Clara absentmindedly licked her lips as she stared at his crotch. If he was still as hard as he was a moment ago, there's no doubt his boner bulged obscenely in his tight boxer briefs.

""Yeah,"" she said. ""Lose 'em and lay face down."" He quickly shucked his underwear, baring his sexy butt to me and Bridget. I heard Bridget gasp next to me as my boyfriend suddenly made himself nude in front of her. I thought I heard a gasp from Clara too, who no doubt saw his big boner bounce into view. He made no attempt to cover it up as he stepped out of his underwear and onto the table. Bridget and I caught a quick glimpse of it standing proudly away from his body before he lay fully down.

Clara laid the small towel across his butt and drizzled oil on his back. Then my phone started ringing. It was my boss.

""My boss is calling,"" I said. ""Can I mute the tv?""

""What?!"" Clara said.

""My boss is calling!"" I repeated.

""Take it in my room,"" she said. Not wanting to argue, and having to answer quickly before it went to voicemail, I just followed her order and to the bedroom. I wanted to get through the call quickly, so I could get back to supervise my naked boyfriend and almost naked friends, but my boss was in a chatty mood. She had tickets to the hockey game that night, but the people she was going to go with cancelled. She had one extra ticket along the boards next to her, and then two separate tickets a little farther up, and wanted to know if I wanted to come along with two friends. I'd always loved going to hockey games, so I agreed. She was going out to dinner, though, so I had to go to her house now to pick up the tickets.

I hung up and went back into the living room. David was now laying on his back, his boner tenting the small towel in an absurd way. I noticed Bridget now had her towel tied around her waist instead of her chest, her oiled breasts proudly on display as she stood right next to David's head. I ignored it, she'd already had them out for a while during her massage anyway. Clara's naked chest also seemed covered in oil, though, which seemed strange. Her hard, glistening nipples distracted me a moment before I explained the situation to them. Bridget hated hockey and begged off, but Clara and David were both free tonight and said they'd love to go.

""Hurry up and get dressed,"" I said to David. ""We don't have much time to get to her house to get the tickets.""

""Do I need to go along for that?"" he said. ""My massage is only half done.""

""You drove us here,"" I said.

""You can take a quick über back home and then drive,"" he said.

""And then I can finish up the massage and we'll meet you at the stadium,"" Clara added. I wanted to protest that I didn't want to leave the three of them alone and mostly naked, but it felt mean. It'd mean I didn't trust David and wanted to ruin his massage. I said a quick goodbye and left, hoping David would behave himself. He certainly acted liked he loved me, he and my friends just had a habit of getting naked in front of each other. I stewed on this as I rode home and then drove to my boss' house to pick up the tickets.

Unfortunately, my apartment and Clara's apartment were both a lot closer to the stadium than my boss' house, so it took me forever to get out there and back to the stadium again. But even with that, I was left waiting until the game was about to start before David and Clara showed up. They apologized, saying they lost track of time.

We had a brief disagreement over who should get what seats. I, of course, wanted to sit with David, even if taking the two seats together meant sitting farther away from the action. But Clara protested that she didn't want to sit next to my boss and David said I should get the best seat because it was my connection that got the tickets and that I was the biggest hockey fan of the three of us. I was feeling a little lonely for David, but ended up agreeing with them. If the worst thing to happen at the game was me seeing an NHL game right along the ice, I could manage.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst thing that happened at the game. My team won, and my boss and I had a good time cheering them to the win. That part went so well I thought she might even think about promoting me soon. But that was overshadowed by what happened during the intermission after the second period.

The team put on a few games during the intermission, like a puck shot challenge and some trivia game. But then they did the kiss cam. The cameramen found couples in the crowd and projected them onto the huge screen hanging over the ice. The couples were then expected to kiss. And of course, just my luck, one of the ""couples"" they found was David and Clara.

It took them a moment to realize they were the ones on the screen. I expected them to just blush and wave. But they just looked at each other a moment, shrugged, and then dove into a passionate kiss, wrapping their arms around each other. I thought I saw David open his mouth too, to French kiss her, but the camera quickly cut away. I looked to their section, but couldn't pick them out of the crowd. I burned with jealousy. My boss asked me what was wrong, but I couldn't tell her it was because I just caught my boyfriend making out with my friend. I lied that I had to go to the bathroom, and went to compose myself.

I had calmed down about it by the time the game ended. What were they supposed to do? They were on the kiss cam and they kissed, it wasn't that big a deal. And I couldn't be sure that it was anything beyond a dramatic closed-mouth one for the camera. So I decided to just pretend I hadn't seen it when we met up outside.

Since David and I had cars there and Clara didn't, she asked him to drive her home and he agreed. I wasn't thrilled they were going to spend more time alone, but couldn't give a good reason to tell them they couldn't. She did need a ride home, after all, and I wasn't dying to spend time with her after everything that'd happened today. So I drove home alone and waited there until David got back. It took a surprisingly long time. Clara lived maybe five minutes away, but he didn't get home until like a half hour after I did.

I used that time to get ready for bed, and waited under the covers for David to join me. I thought he'd jump into bed with me right away and fuck me senseless, but he took his time getting ready for bed before turning the lights off and slipping in next to me. I tried to initiate sex with him (I'd spent all day thinking about him half-naked with my friends and I needed some release), but he declined, saying he was tired from the day.

""Can you at least tell me what happened?"" I asked.

""What do you mean?"" he said.

""I took the call from my boss, briefly checked in a little while later, and then met you at the stadium two hours after that,"" I said. ""So how was the massage?""

""Oh right,"" he said. ""Well the massage started normally after you took the call in the other room. She massaged my back and legs for a while.""

""Like with Bridget?""

""Yeah,"" he said. ""Except Clara was up on the table with me.""

""Why?""

""She said my muscles were stiffer because I was bigger. Actually, because I was 'big and muscly' was what she said. Anyway, she had to get on the table to get more leverage. But then Bridget started teasing that she just wanted to rub her boobs on me.""

""She was rubbing her boobs on you?"" I asked.

""Not at first,"" he continued. ""She was pushing really hard and I guess her boobs were probably swinging around from the exertion and I could feel her nipples graze against my back. I guess her boobs were feeling really heavy then, though, cause she leaned further at let them rest against my back as she worked. And that's when Bridget started teasing her about it.""

""What did she do?""

""She asked if her boobs were bothering me, pressed into my back like that. I said no. It did feel kinda weird because I could definitely feel their weight pressing against me and her nipples digging into my back, but I know that they're really a pain for her to haul around so I wanted to help.""

""Yeah, I'm sure they're such a big hassle,"" I said sarcastically. Clara loved her big boobs.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

It was a few months before I had any more trouble with Clara. Well, I was pretty sure she and David were still sending nude pics to each other regularly. He'd changed his phone notifications so that picture previews would no longer appear, so I wasn't sure exactly what they were texting each other. But they were texting each other quite a lot. I figured if it was just pictures, though, there wasn't much to get upset about. I mean, he could find pictures of naked women all over the internet, I just happened to know the woman they belonged to. Plus, he was much hornier all the time, and I was hardly one to complain about my boyfriend pounding the hell out of me every night.

All that changed, though, when Clara started her massage class. She bugged David to let her practice on him, and at first he resisted. He may be naive, but I think some part of him realized that being alone with her while she rubbed his half-naked body was probably not the best idea. She eventually suggested that I come along and get a massage too, and that sealed it. I could be there to make sure no lines were crossed as well as get a massage of my own.

When we arrived at Clara's apartment, though, she had just started giving our other friend Bridget a massage. The massage bed was set up in the living room, and Bridget lay on it underneath a towel that covered her from her otherwise bare shoulders to the middle of her thick thighs. Acres of her tanned, naked legs stretched out to the end of the table. It was funny seeing Clara hunched over her, because while Clara is a petite, pale redhead, Bridget is a tan, brunette Amazon. Clara was smoking hot, but Bridget oozed more matronly sensuality. She was taller than me, almost as tall as David in fact, with a pear-shaped body. Her thin chest supported medium-sized boobs. Her stomach was mostly flat, and then her hips flared out into a wide booty and thick, succulent thighs. The towel did little to hide the substantial hill of her butt, just like the yoga pants and skinny jeans she typically wore.

David and I said hi as we entered, and Clara immediately ran to David, her large, round breasts bouncing unsupported underneath her thin tank top. She leapt into his arms and wrapped her smooth, pale legs around his waist as she hugged him tightly, pressing her chest tightly into his. She grabbed his head and kissed him on the cheek, though it looked like it was more on the corner of his mouth. Then she dropped down and gave me a light hug. Bridget waved from the massage bed, saying she was only in panties underneath the towel, so couldn't get up to hug us.

David and I took seats on the living room couch. Clara joked that David probably didn't want to hear all of their girl talk and turned the tv to a basketball game. I couldn't stand watching sports, but I was glad he would at least be distracted from the sight of Clara, in a tank top and tight shorts, rubbing the half-naked Bridget. We had a direct side-view of the table and could see Bridget's stunning, curvy silhouette under the towel, but as long as she stayed mostly covered, I thought the basketball game would keep David occupied.

It worked, at first, as Clara massaged Bridget's shoulders and neck, but then she rolled the towel back down to Bridget's waist. Her entire naked back was on display, and as Clara started rubbing oil into it, I snuck a peek at David and saw him intensely watching the proceedings. Bridget's boobs weren't the size of Clara's, but they were bigger than mine and definitely a good handful, which caused them to bulge out from her sides where they were pressed into the table. She cooed and moaned softly as Clara worked on her back, and I could feel David squirming in his seat next to me.

Clara finished massaging Bridget's back and moved down to her legs. Her thighs jiggled and swayed as Clara rubbed and shook the immense amount of flesh on display. I could see David watching out of the corner of my eye, and I wanted to chastise him, but didn't want to call him a pervert in front of the other girls. I really thought he and I would be together long-term, so didn't want them thinking he was a gross, leering weirdo. I reminded myself to talk to him when we got back home.

""Ok,"" Clara said, finishing up her legs. ""I'll have to do your butt.""

Bridget giggled and said ok and Clara grabbed the towel and pulled it off her body. We got a momentary side view of Bridget's prone, naked body interrupted only by the thin band of her panties stretching across her hip. Then, Bridget shrieked and grabbed for the towel, momentarily lifting her chest up off the table and showing us one bare breast capped by a hard, pink nipple, before flopping back onto the table. She struggled to throw the towel back over herself.

""What are you doing?!"" Clara said between laughs.

""You're showing David my panties!"" Bridget said.

""He doesn't care,"" Clara said. ""Plus, your panties will have to come off.""

""What?!""

""For the full experience,"" Clara continued, grasping the sides of Bridget's panties. ""Trust me, it's worth it.""

""But they'll see me!"" Bridget said.

""You're such a prude,"" Clara said. She grabbed the towel from Bridget and bunched it up on the side of the table between Bridget's butt and us. ""There, now they won't be able to see anything.""

She was right. Seated on the side like we were, the pile of towel blocked our view of her from her waist to the top of her thighs.

""Fine,"" Bridget said, then rolled her head to face us. ""No getting up to go to the bathroom though, you two!""

Clara pulled Bridget's panties down her legs and off her body. I could hear David gulp next to me. We couldn't see any of her private parts, but the knowledge that Bridget lay there completely naked and exposed weighed heavily in the air. Clara drizzled oil across her large, soft cheeks and massaged it in.

""Just to warn you,"" Clara said. ""I'm about to do something that's not part of normal massages.""

""What,"" Bridget said. ""Undress me in front of our friends?"" We all laughed.

""Very funny,"" Clara said. ""But no. My teacher is one of the foremost advocates of sphincter massage.""

""My butthole?!"" Bridget shrieked. Clara said yes. She then went into a long explanation of how humans keep tension in every muscle, especially in our cores. That included our anuses, which can be incredibly tight, but due to shyness, almost never get massaged.

""So you're just gonna rub up and down my crack?"" Bridget asked.

""That's how we'll start, yes,"" Clara said, and made her first pass across Bridget's rear entrance. I couldn't see, of course, but yelp Bridget let out could only mean one thing. Clara shushed her and did it again, and this time Bridget stiffened, but didn't yelp.

""See? So much tension,"" Clara said as she continued rubbing. Bridget soon started emitting the soft coos and moans she had during the best parts of the massage.

""I can see what you mean,"" Bridget said. ""That actually feels really good now.""

""Good,"" Clara said. ""Then you're ready for the second part."" She stopped rubbing and pressed her hand forward into Bridget. Bridget shrieked loudly and lifted her chest off the table, giving us another view of her quivering breasts as they hung from her chest.

""What are you doing?!"" Bridget said.

""You're fingering my butthole!"" Bridget protested, then realized she was baring her chest for us and flopped back onto the bed.

""It'll start to feel really good again,"" Clara said. ""Just give it a moment.""

David and I watched from the couch as Clara sawed her finger in and out of Bridget's anus. Clara was right and soon Bridget's grunts turned into soft moans. I swore I could even see Bridget pressing her ass back into Clara's fingers, though I couldn't be sure.

""You're right,"" Bridget cooed. ""That feels wonderful.""

""The first time my teacher did it to me, I almost came,"" Clara said.

""I can see why,"" Bridget said, before turning her face to David and I. ""Oh, sorry guys.""

""Don't worry,"" David said. ""Just enjoy yourself.""

""Yeah it really is wonderful,"" Clara said. ""I wish someone could give me one everyday."" Bridget moaned in agreement.

It was over a minute later, and Clara went to wash her hands in the kitchen. When she came back, she told Bridget to roll over.

""Ok, will you hold up the towel?"" Bridget asked.

""What for?"" Clara said.

""Uh, my boobs?"" Bridget said. Clara shrugged. ""David's here?""

""He's seen boobs before,"" Clara said.

""Yeah, but not mine,"" Bridget said. She must not have realized she flashed us twice already, though rolling over for the remainder of the massage would certainly be different from a quick flash.

""Oh, he doesn't care,"" Clara said. ""He and I have been trading nude pics for a couple months now.""

I froze. I didn't want my other girl friends knowing what she and David had been up to, but I guess that cat was out of the bag now.

""What, really?"" Bridget said. ""You're so naughty. Natalie, you're okay with this?""

I just shrugged. I'd come to terms with it, but didn't want to explain myself to my friend.

""Well I don't see why you sending him pics of your tits means I need to be naked in front of him,"" Bridget said.

Her huge tits, capped with hard, light pink nipples popped into view and bounced around as she pulled the tank top off her arms and threw it to the ground.

""Good god, girl,"" Bridget said. ""Fine. He'll be distracted by your huge knockers anyway."" And with that, she rolled over. The towel was still piled at her side, and her hips were so wide, that we got a good view of one oiled buttcheek and her naked buttcrack as she rolled over. Then she lay back down, her breasts falling back somewhat into her chest, but still sticking up off her body slightly. Her nipples were as hard as Clara's.

If it weren't for the loud basketball game in the background, you'd be able to hear a pin drop as Clara started massaging Bridget's shoulders. Clara's tits hung away from her body as she leaned over the table and shook back and forth as she rubbed Bridget's flesh. After a moment, she moved on to Bridget's chest.

""All I could find was this one,"" Clara said, returning with a small hand towel. ""But luckily we won't have to worry about your boobs.""

""Should I take these off?"" David asked, pointing to his underwear. Clara absentmindedly licked her lips as she stared at his crotch. If he was still as hard as he was a moment ago, there's no doubt his boner bulged obscenely in his tight boxer briefs.

""Yeah,"" she said. ""Lose 'em and lay face down."" He quickly shucked his underwear, baring his sexy butt to me and Bridget. I heard Bridget gasp next to me as my boyfriend suddenly made himself nude in front of her. I thought I heard a gasp from Clara too, who no doubt saw his big boner bounce into view. He made no attempt to cover it up as he stepped out of his underwear and onto the table. Bridget and I caught a quick glimpse of it standing proudly away from his body before he lay fully down.

Clara laid the small towel across his butt and drizzled oil on his back. Then my phone started ringing. It was my boss.

""My boss is calling,"" I said. ""Can I mute the tv?""

""What?!"" Clara said.

""My boss is calling!"" I repeated.

""Take it in my room,"" she said. Not wanting to argue, and having to answer quickly before it went to voicemail, I just followed her order and to the bedroom. I wanted to get through the call quickly, so I could get back to supervise my naked boyfriend and almost naked friends, but my boss was in a chatty mood.

""Do I need to go along for that?"" he said. ""My massage is only half done.""

""You drove us here,"" I said.

""You can take a quick über back home and then drive,"" he said.

""And then I can finish up the massage and we'll meet you at the stadium,"" Clara added. I wanted to protest that I didn't want to leave the three of them alone and mostly naked, but it felt mean.

But even with that, I was left waiting until the game was about to start before David and Clara showed up. They apologized, saying they lost track of time.

We had a brief disagreement over who should get what seats. I, of course, wanted to sit with David, even if taking the two seats together meant sitting farther away from the action. But Clara protested that she didn't want to sit next to my boss and David said I should get the best seat because it was my connection that got the tickets and that I was the biggest hockey fan of the three of us. I was feeling a little lonely for David, but ended up agreeing with them. If the worst thing to happen at the game was me seeing an NHL game right along the ice, I could manage.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst thing that happened at the game. My team won, and my boss and I had a good time cheering them to the win. That part went so well I thought she might even think about promoting me soon. But that was overshadowed by what happened during the intermission after the second period.

The team put on a few games during the intermission, like a puck shot challenge and some trivia game. But then they did the kiss cam. The cameramen found couples in the crowd and projected them onto the huge screen hanging over the ice. The couples were then expected to kiss. And of course, just my luck, one of the ""couples"" they found was David and Clara.

It took them a moment to realize they were the ones on the screen. I expected them to just blush and wave. But they just looked at each other a moment, shrugged, and then dove into a passionate kiss, wrapping their arms around each other. I thought I saw David open his mouth too, to French kiss her, but the camera quickly cut away. I looked to their section, but couldn't pick them out of the crowd. I burned with jealousy. My boss asked me what was wrong, but I couldn't tell her it was because I just caught my boyfriend making out with my friend. I lied that I had to go to the bathroom, and went to compose myself.

I had calmed down about it by the time the game ended. What were they supposed to do? They were on the kiss cam and they kissed, it wasn't that big a deal. And I couldn't be sure that it was anything beyond a dramatic closed-mouth one for the camera. So I decided to just pretend I hadn't seen it when we met up outside.

Since David and I had cars there and Clara didn't, she asked him to drive her home and he agreed. I wasn't thrilled they were going to spend more time alone, but couldn't give a good reason to tell them they couldn't. She did need a ride home, after all, and I wasn't dying to spend time with her after everything that'd happened today. So I drove home alone and waited there until David got back. It took a surprisingly long time. Clara lived maybe five minutes away, but he didn't get home until like a half hour after I did.

I used that time to get ready for bed, and waited under the covers for David to join me. I thought he'd jump into bed with me right away and fuck me senseless, but he took his time getting ready for bed before turning the lights off and slipping in next to me. I tried to initiate sex with him (I'd spent all day thinking about him half-naked with my friends and I needed some release), but he declined, saying he was tired from the day.

""Can you at least tell me what happened?"" I asked.

""What do you mean?"" he said.

""I took the call from my boss, briefly checked in a little while later, and then met you at the stadium two hours after that,"" I said. ""So how was the massage?""

""Oh right,"" he said. ""Well the massage started normally after you took the call in the other room. She massaged my back and legs for a while.""

""Like with Bridget?""

""Yeah,"" he said. ""Except Clara was up on the table with me.""

""Why?""

""She said my muscles were stiffer because I was bigger. Actually, because I was 'big and muscly' was what she said. Anyway, she had to get on the table to get more leverage. But then Bridget started teasing that she just wanted to rub her boobs on me.""

""She was rubbing her boobs on you?"" I asked.

""Not at first,"" he continued. ""She was pushing really hard and I guess her boobs were probably swinging around from the exertion and I could feel her nipples graze against my back. I guess her boobs were feeling really heavy then, though, cause she leaned further at let them rest against my back as she worked. And that's when Bridget started teasing her about it.""

""What did she do?""

""She asked if her boobs were bothering me, pressed into my back like that. I said no. It did feel kinda weird because I could definitely feel their weight pressing against me and her nipples digging into my back, but I know that they're really a pain for her to haul around so I wanted to help.""

""Yeah, I'm sure they're such a big hassle,"" I said sarcastically. Clara loved her big boobs.",,2025-08-15T18:59:17.932709,3675,2.0

""It's too nice of a day to waste inside. What do you think about heading over to the park?"" Beth asked, looking away from the window and into the eyes of her boyfriend.

""And what exactly will we be doing at the park?""

""I don't know, read a book? We've got plenty of those. Besides, don't you want to get some fresh air?""

Hold up. Don't you mean you think it's too nice of a day to waste inside? Because if you ask me, I think it's a perfect day to sit inside our air-conditioned apartment and watch the game with an ice-cold beer. It's a really important game, Babe,"" said Kevin, tilting his head to the side, as if his concluding sentence could sway her thoughts.

""What if we only stayed for like an hour?"" she said with her cute little pout.

""Don't do the face. You know you have an unfair advantage?""

She nodded as she continued pouting.

She wouldn't relent. Once she had an idea in her head, it was game on. He was wrapped around her little finger, so he complied.

""Alright. Okay. I'll watch the game on my phone.""

But now that they were at the park, she was regretting her decision. With her head resting in his lap, she noticed his phone was no longer in the proximity of his face.

That's when she observed him out of the corner of her eye. She followed his focused gaze and saw a curvaceous stranger.

She was walking along the path in a summer dress that covered her ass. She paused at a bench not too far from where they were lounging. Before she could set down her tote bag, a strong breeze lifted the hem of her dress, showing off her nude thong along with her ass. He licked his lips and pressed them together.

The woman sat down and pulled out a book. She diverted her attention and locked eyes with Kevin, throwing him an encouraging smile.

Noticing that Beth was looking up at him, he shook his head from his trance. He grinned down at her, not wanting to discuss the brief exchange, and kissed her forehead. He continued to sneak an occasional glance at the woman until Beth reached a boiling point.

Beth couldn't shake the thoughts that suddenly consumed her. Jealousy and curiosity crossed her, wandering her mind until she settled on a thought she couldn't let go. She wondered how she would react if she caught them in a compromising situation.

""Kev?"" she asked, walking her fingers along his thigh.

""Hmm..What's up?"" He said, feigning interest in the game.

""What do you think about her?""

""And who might you be referring to? He asked. He swiveled his head from left to right and shrugged his shoulders. His clueless act was terrible.

She rolled her eyes. ""You've got to be kidding me. For godsakes, be fucking honest with me. You can't sit here and tell me that the woman over there isn't hot as hell,"" she said, pointing in her direction.

""Beth, you know it's not polite to point,"" he said, yanking her hand down.

""What? She can't see me.""

""Beth, my sweet, I don't have a clue what you're accusing me of.""

""Huh, well,"" she said, pointing at his bulge, ""if that isn't a good indicator, I don't know what is.""

He tried his best to conceal it.

""That obvious, huh?""

""Uh, yeah. Why don't you ask her what's up?""

""What are you getting at?""

""Let's see if you still got it.""

""Wait. Are you giving me a hall pass?""

""If that's what you want to call it. You better get to it before you lose your chance.""

""You mean you want me to get her to sleep with me? Is this some twisted trap?""

""Not in the least. Bring her back to our place. I've got some grocery shopping to do before I get back. Stall her with some small talk. I want to watch.""

The bulge in his pants pulsated in response.

He stood up and looked back at Beth for one more nod of approval. ""Get to it. I'll be home in about 30 minutes,"" she said with her last bit of encouragement.

She folded up the blanket and watched her boyfriend tentatively walk over to the woman.

Beth half hoped the woman would refuse to speak to him, like there was some woman-to-woman honor code. But the buxom stranger was definitely not a part of that unspoken rule. She invited him to sit next to her and turned towards him. She arched her back in an imperceptible motion seen by Beth, so he could enjoy the view of her cleavage from a much better vantage point.

Beth had set things in motion. There was no turning back. If she couldn't handle what was about to transpire, it would all be her fault, but if she could, what kind of girlfriend would that make her?

Her heart skipped a beat with a giddiness she hadn't expected.

She meandered around the grocery store and took her time in the wine section. Her mind flitted between rage and wonder, before she finally settled on a pinot grigio.

Her phone buzzed and illuminated with a text from Kevin, ""Otw home,"" with a winky face emoji.

When she arrived home, she walked to their partially cracked bedroom door. Beth could hear them whispering, unable to make out their words.

As if on cue, Kevin pulled the woman close to him and gave her ass a couple of two-handed smacks while they kissed. She unzipped his jeans and took his cock into her hands. But rather than seek his own pleasure, he turned her around, giving her soft staccato kisses along her collarbone and neck.

While nibbling her earlobe with his teeth, he traced his fingers along her sides, eliciting soft giggles from the beautiful stranger. With his hands over the fabric of her dress, he pulled down the front of her dress, exposing her creamy breasts.

Walking towards the wall, he ripped off her thong and spread her cheeks. He teased her wet pussy with his tip, giving her a little taste of what was to come. She pushed against the wall, wagging her ass out, aching for him to please her.

""Oh God, fuck me. Fuck me now.""

""Say please.""

""Please,"" she said between moans. ""I want to feel your cock inside me.""

""Say it again.""

""Ahh, please, please fuck me,"" she begged.

""Remember, Beth's watching.""

The other woman released a low, sensuous moan with her eyes closed while he shoved his throbbing cock into her. Her eyes widened as she pushed her ass back against him, rocking her pelvis to meet his thrusts.

""Damn, you're so fucking wet. Your pussy's so tight,"" he said, slapping the firm curve of her ass.

""I love how big and hard you are inside me,"" she said, leaning back against his chest.

Kevin spanked her ass harder, pressing his cock deeper inside.

""Don't stop. Please, don't stop, I'm about to..."" she moaned, over and over.

""Do you want me to cum in you?""

""Yes, I want you to fill my wet pussy,"" she said as she reached her orgasm.

He held her hips as he pounded harder into her. She covered her mouth and tried to suppress a scream as her orgasm subsided.

""I'm about to,"" he groaned.

He clasped her waist and unloaded his seed into her. He held her to him and kissed her lips gently before pulling himself away, leaving her pussy dripping with his cum.

Beth leaned against the wall, trying to catch her breath. She felt like she was going to faint. Her heart was racing. She could feel the heat of her arousal rising in to her cheeks.

As she fanned herself, she considered rewarding Kevin with another hall pass. Perhaps their guest wouldn't mind staying for dinner and possibly dessert?",,2025-08-15T18:59:52.963482,1342,

I now have an editor, so you all shouldn't need to put up with my typos and poor/dyslexic editing skills anymore.

:)

* * *

Sarah stared out across the immense Bolavine River as the barge that she, Amy, and Ellis were on sailed towards a dock at a port city along the river. She had found herself spending rather a lot of time on the deck watching the peaceful lapping of water against the barge's side, or the tiny little waves made by the wind, or the wakes left by a large ship passing. She found it peaceful, serene, and a great comfort with what was going on in her life right now.

""Illuminar -- blessed be You -- thank you for taking care of me."" She looked up at the bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds that only accentuated the blueness and vastness of the sky. ""Now please, please protect Fiona and Conner. Take care of them and make sure that Lady Ekthros can't hurt them. Please do something so that she'll never be able to hurt them ever again. I don't know what, but I know you can come up with something. Please?""

She closed her eyes, savoring the gentle breeze that was drifting in from the river. It smelled wonderful. The boat was gently rocking and she found the motion both calming and relaxing.

""Sarah?"" Amy's voice came from behind her a few minutes later.

""Hey."" She smiled at her traveling companion and possibly her future co-wife if the artistic girl had her way. She wouldn't mind that.

""You've been up here a lot the past two days."" Amy pointed out as she joined Sarah at the railing.

""Yeah, I've been thinking and praying."" She replied. ""I like the wind and the motion of the ship, plus this is quite a sight."" She indicated the Bolavine River, which was narrower than usual at this spot at 'only' half a mile wide. It was a bit wider if you included the natural bay that they were sailing into though.

""It is nice; I wish I had enough supplies to paint it properly."" Amy smiled as she looked at the river. ""Do you usually spend so much time praying?""

""Um, I used to."" Sarah frowned at herself. ""I guess it was easy to forget in Karnas because life was easy. I think I got out of the habit but I want to get back into it.""

""I admire that. I always forget to pray unless something really bad happens. I kind of feel bad about that.""

Sarah gave her a sympathetic smile. ""I can relate. What happened..."" She wanted to say 'with lady Ekthros', but couldn't with the woman's threats. ""...in Karnas made me realize that I need Illuminar's help more than ever right now.""

""I think it's ironic that the most devout person I know is... well, you know.""

""Possessed?"" Sarah whispered so that no one would hear, even though almost no one was around.

Amy nodded.

Sarah got a small smile on her face. ""But wouldn't someone with my problem need Illuminar more?""

Amy nodded slowly and then cocked her head to one side. Her dark brown hair fell straight down, though it was kept out of her face by a cloth ribbon that she'd tied like a headband with an artistic knot. ""You're different.""

""Oh?""

She nodded. ""You seem... peaceful. Relaxed.""

""I'm really not right now."" Sarah replied, thinking of her concerns about what Lady Ekthros might do to both Fiona and Conner.

""But you look like you are."" Amy replied. ""I remember when we met and you seemed almost as scared as I was."" She hesitated. ""I'm still that scared sometimes.""

""Hmm."" Sarah thought about that for several moments before replying. ""I am different than I was, aren't I?""

Amy nodded. ""Very.""

""Good different?""

Amy nodded again.

Sarah thought about that for a moment. Her talk with Ethan a few weeks ago had given her a new way to see herself so that she didn't think she was worthless anymore. Fiona had pointed out that she didn't need to be afraid. And then everything with Lady Ekthros... Hmm, she had been through so much lately that it didn't seem real.

""I'm not sure why."" Sarah said honestly. ""I should be a mess right now, but I'm not.""

""I'm glad."" Amy said and then added hesitantly. ""I've... I've never done anything like this before. Leaving everything behind, especially with someone I just met, and traveling to another country to meet someone that I've never met but might marry. It's scary.""

Sarah put her arm around her friend and smiled. ""Don't worry, Rindrin isn't so bad.""

Amy chuckled nervously but seemed to take comfort from having Sarah's arm around her. ""I'm not worried about him, just..."" She bit her lip. ""Thank you for being so strong; I don't think I would be okay if you weren't.""

Sarah couldn't help but laugh. ""Strong? Me?""

Amy nodded.

The innkeeper's daughter slowly shook her head, wondering what strange world she'd found herself in where someone was calling her strong. Her of all people.

""Well, I'm glad I can help."" She smiled at Amy.

""Oh, I forgot."" The artistic girl said after a moment. ""Ellis says that we should be ready to disembark soon. He's getting the animals ready.""

""Okay, let's go then."" Sarah slipped her arm off Amy's shoulder and offered her hand, which Amy took. Together they headed back to their hammocks to collect their things.

* * *

""So basically, we're just here to drop me off."" Selene summarized to Luminar Kossel after Ethan had explained the orc situation and how Lord Kalus was taking a week to train the orcs in preparation for the upcoming battle. Most of the crew was there listening as well.

""Yup."" Ethan agreed. ""After that, we're heading right back to Dotmier to finish dealing with the orc situation while Selene can hopefully deal with Gonorran and the portal situation.""

""Efficient."" Luminar Kossel nodded once. ""I'll wait in this area for you to return from Dotmier. As Elder Goman wrote in the letter, I did bring Gonorran's portal and its control podium in case Miss Dawson is successful so it can be used to return all the men and equipment to Earth once the portal on Earth has been destroyed.""

""Good."" Selene said. ""I wouldn't want all the Earth tech to stay here, not to mention the stranded people.""

""Yes, it can be quite disconcerting to suddenly be stranded so far from home."" Luminar Kossel replied.

""So, Kendra tells me that you once worked for the agency that's behind this?"" Selene asked.

""Indeed."" He replied. ""Tell me what happened to bring you here and I'll help to prepare you for your mission as best as I can.""

She did.

She recounted the story, giving as much detail as she remembered.

By the time she had finished, Luminar Kossel had a wry smile on his face. ""Smithbond eh?""

""Yup, though I don't know his real name.""

""I think I know the man."" Kossel stroked his chin. ""He was a newer recruit serving under me when I left and it sounds like he's just as incompetent as ever.""

Selene cocked her head to one side as her mouth fell open. ""You're kidding.""

Luminar Kossel leaned an elbow on the railing of the Argo and looked back at her, an amused smile on his face. ""He's not too tall but he's well built, he likes taking off his sunglasses dramatically not long after meeting someone, he seemingly has no conscience but does have a brutal streak, and he incessantly quotes movie lines?""

""That does indeed sound like Smithbond."" Selene replied. ""You're saying he's incompetent?""

""Yes."" Luminar Kossel stated matter-of-factly and then slowly shook his head. ""I can't believe they put that bungling fool in charge of anything, much less a major operation. That's a perfect example of someone being in the right place at the right time.""

Selene stared.

""Incompetent?"" Ethan said. ""It sounds like he got everything he wanted and he took Selene apart in hand-to-hand combat. I've seen her fight and that's impressive.""

Luminar Kossel shrugged. ""Maybe he's gotten better, most people do after so many years, but he's only slightly better if he is at all."" He looked at Ethan. ""Based on what Selene has said, he's still utterly incompetent.""

""How do you know?"" Beth asked.

""Yeah, I'd like to know too."" Selene added.

""First, let's start with his attempt to onboard you, and remember that I used to work for them."" He looked at Selene. ""Instead of having you kicked out of the FBI, why didn't he have your boss call you and tell you to work with him? Wouldn't you have done so eagerly with orders from your boss?""

""Absolutely."" The former agent nodded.

""Then after the mission was over, he could've offered you a chance to work with them by

promoting

you from the FBI with an honorable discharge. If it would've been framed that way and he had been decent about it, wouldn't you have wanted to work with him?""

""I would've jumped at the chance."" Selene nodded. ""Again, assuming he had been decent.""

""That's how they recruited me from the Special Forces and how I recruited others."" Kossel said. ""I think you can see it's a better way to handle it.""

""I can."" She agreed again.

""That's strike one."" Luminar Kossel continued. ""The second strike was sending agents to pick up your friends, Jason, Melinda, and Hailey. That would've been

far

better handled with a soft touch. A single agent, maybe two, and a phone call personally from the governor asking them to cooperate would've done the trick.""

""From the governor?"" Ethan stared.

The luminar shrugged. ""It worked every time I tried it.""

""How many times?"" Ethan asked.

""How many governors?"" Selene added.

""Enough."" Their guest smiled. ""Beating Selene senseless to bully Hailey into revealing what she knew was, well, senseless. Yes, he accomplished the objective, but at the cost of alienating

all

of his most valuable sources of information. Besides, threatening a pregnant woman?"" Kossel shook his head. ""That's out of line unless she's an enemy asset, and even then..."" He shook his head again. ""Clive overplayed his hand.""

""Clive?"" Selene asked. That couldn't be Smithbond's name... could it?

Luminar Kossel smiled. ""Special Agent Clive Eustace Humphrey.""

Selene started chuckling, then laughing. ""No wonder he pretended his name was something else.""

Everyone else was chuckling as well.

""Do you have any operational advice?"" Kendra asked.

""Perhaps, Mrs. Ejder."" He winked at her.

She blushed.

""Although, I must admit that the sight of you in a dress is something I never thought I'd see outside of an undercover mission."" The luminar continued. ""Marriage suits you.""

""She's a wonderful wife too."" Ethan said with undeniable pride in his tone.

Kendra blushed even deeper. ""The mission. Do you have any advice?""

""Same old Kendra."" Luminar Kossel replied with something not unlike fatherly pride in his voice. ""The mission always comes first.""

""When my best friend is going to another world without backup, yes it does."" The dragon huntress's tone was even, but fierce.

Selene felt her heart soar for a moment at her friend's response... then she remembered that she was going to leave the Argo if the mission was a success.

Luminar Kossel smiled. ""Kendra, it is truly a wonderful thing to see you with friends and family.""

A smile formed on her face but it lasted only a moment. ""What about Selene's mission? Do you know anything that can help her succeed, and more importantly, come back safely?""

""I do have some thoughts, but perhaps we should discuss this over a late lunch?"" He looked up at the sky. ""Or perhaps a very early afternoon tea.""

""Either is fine."" Ethan replied. ""The inn in the outpost nearby is usually pretty deserted and the cook is great.""

*But are you referring to her food?* Alana thought to everyone with a sly tone.

Judging by his emotions, Ethan would probably be blushing if he was human. That led Selene to a thought; Ethan could sense her emotions as well. Given what had happened lately, and especially her guilt about the whole birthday thing...

Hmm.

She made a quick adjustment to her mental defenses to prevent him from sensing what she was feeling.

Yeah, that was a good idea.

""Which outpost?"" Luminar Kossel asked. ""I only know of one nearby and it's usually rather busy.""

""Busy?"" Selene frowned, then walked to the other side of the Argo and looked over the railing. Sarah's inn was still reasonably far away, but not so far that she couldn't see a half dozen horses in the small paddock attached to the inn's small stable.

""That's... strange."" She said after a moment.

""I wonder why the business picked up."" Ethan mused after joining her at the railing.

""Me too."" The Brazilian woman replied. ""Pretty much no one wanted to stay there because of Sarah, so I don't see how it would get busy as long as...""

Oh.

She looked at Ethan and saw the same realization in his eyes.

""Maybe she married that blacksmith?"" Ethan said after a moment. He was obviously trying to be casual, but he was also completely failing. His posture was unnaturally stiff and his 'natural' tone sounded rather forced.

""I don't think so."" Selene replied. ""I last saw her, what, just under three weeks ago?""

""Nineteen days, so yeah."" Ethan replied.

She chuckled. ""Not that you're counting or anything.""

For a second time in as many minutes, she was sure Ethan would've turned beet red if he could blush.

""And that's nothing to be ashamed of."" Alana said as she joined them at the railing. ""He's going to have seven wives; there's absolutely nothing wrong with him wanting a specific woman to be one of those wives.""

""Thank you."" Ethan said to his first wife.

""It seems strange that the inn is busy."" The wood elf said after a few moments. ""Perhaps that warrants a closer look.""

""Let's go."" Ethan said, turning towards the stairs to the lower decks where they kept the rope ladder.

""Ethan."" Alana called out to stop him. ""Maybe you shouldn't go.""

Selene had been thinking the same thing but was glad the wood elf had voiced it first.

""Why?"" He replied, a slightly dragon-tinged edge in his tone.

""That's why."" Alana replied gently. ""You and Selene haven't, uh, 'spent some time together' in over a week and it's definitely showing. Can you think of a worse idea than introducing an irate dragon to an unknown situation?""

""Isn't that how Beth died in Arcanum?"" Selene added.

""Fine."" Ethan almost snapped, then looked at Selene. ""Downstairs, now.""

""I beg your pardon."" She raised her eyebrow.

The corner of Ethan's mouth twitched up slightly, like a dog's sometimes does when it's about to growl. Moments later he looked at Alana, then his expression slowly softened.

He took a deep breath and then looked at Selene. ""I'm sorry. I was being a total ass.""

""Yeah, your dragon side does that."" She sighed. ""I forgive you and you aren't wrong."" She wasn't looking forward to 'holding his wing', but it seemed likely that Sarah wasn't at the inn and they needed to investigate; he needed to be calmed before that happened.

Ethan took a deep breath and let it out slowly, then turned to Selene. ""If you would be willing, could we retire to the lower decks for a few minutes?""

""Sure."" The Brazilian woman replied, rather anxious to get to the inn and see what was going on.

* * *

Ethan sat in the storage room below the captain's cabin with the door ajar just enough that he could slip one of his wings through it so Selene could hold it. She had really nice hands. Well, she had really nice

everything

actually -- the woman was so beautiful that it was sometimes hard to believe -- but the Brazilian woman wasn't occupying his thoughts right now.

Sarah was.

What had happened?

The way that the innkeeper's daughter had told it, no one came to the inn because of her. If all of a sudden the inn was quite busy, then there was one obvious conclusion...

""Yeah, I'm worried too."" Selene's very feminine voice came from the other side of the door. ""That's why we're doing this, right?""

Ethan looked down at his almost entirely flaccid cock. Concern for someone you cared about did tend to have that effect. Having one of his wives there would surely help, but also made it hard to release the testicle that only worked for Selene.

""Yeah."" He finally replied to Selene's question. ""I suppose I promised to finish a certain story, didn't I?""

""Um, about that...""

When she didn't explain, he checked his bond with her to figure out--

Oh.

She had blocked him from sensing her emotions.

Huh.

He frowned for a moment, remembering how Alana doing that had led to him being unaware that she had been ambushed by Kendra when they had attacked Havorleth's lair to free Taloni. He almost told Selene that she should unblock him, but then reconsidered. Alana was his wife, but Selene wasn't. Further, Selene was about to leave the Argo and go to Earth so it shouldn't cause any problems. He wasn't happy about it, but he didn't think now was the time to address it. He made a mental note to talk to her about it after they checked out the inn and hoped that he wouldn't forget.

""You were saying."" Ethan prompted after several long moments.

""You put a condition on it, that I keep my fingers to myself, and I... uh, didn't.""

""Oh?"" He frowned.

That didn't sound like Selene at all.

She had been

really

into the edging/denial thing and he found it hard to believe that someone with enough willpower to train the way she did would cave. Plus, his dragon instincts told him that she would never be properly happy and sexually fulfilled unless she was being 'forced' to edge regularly. Maybe not for long periods, but regularly for short periods was something she craved.

For her to cave?

Hmm.

That didn't sound right.

""Yeah, I was really horny one night and couldn't resist."" She said in a tone that was almost too neutral.

He looked at the door and his frown deepened. That

definitely

didn't sound like Selene.

""Okay."" He said again, not sure what else to say. He had almost been looking forward to that and every once in a while had thought about which direction to take it.

*Ladies.* Selene thought to everyone. *I'm going to temporarily close my connection to the group chat; can you all help Ethan 'get there' faster so we can go check on Sarah's inn?*

There was a resounding chorus of 'yeses' from wives.

*Okay, peace out ya'll.* Selene closed her connection to the group chat, though her connection with him remained open.

*Something is bothering Selene.* Kendra thought to everyone.

*I noticed.* Alana added. *She's been out of sorts for a few days now.*

*And I don't think it's her impending mission or departure either.* Rachel added. *That's probably part of it, but I would wager that isn't even half of it.*

*The birthday thing.* Kendra piped up. *That's when it started. It seems like that bothered her deeply for some reason.*

*I noticed that too.* Rachel agreed.

*But why?* Beth asked. *She always said that she didn't want to marry Ethan and wanted to break the bond and go back to Earth. Why would it bother her if she got some confirmation from Illuminar that that's what she should do?*

*It's likely

because

she got that confirmation.* Ethan mused. *I'll bet that in her mind, the birthday thing was Illuminar telling her that she

can't

marry me and -- if she's like most Americans -- she doesn't like not having a choice, even if it's about something that she already didn't want to do.*

*Wait, she doesn't like that Illuminar is guiding her away from something she doesn't want?* Taloni was obviously confused judging by her tone.

*She doesn't want anyone telling her what to do.* Rachel explained.

*Except that she does.* Kendra interjected. *That's something I've noticed; she doesn't mind being told what to do. I think a part of her likes it.*

*I noticed that as well.* Rachel agreed.

*I have too.* Alana added.

*It would make a lot more sense if you grew up on Earth.* Ethan replied. *We Earthlings don't tend to like God telling us what to do.*",,2025-08-15T18:59:59.599683,3455,
https://www.literotica.com/s/sissy-cuckquean-mark-and-sandy,"Sissy Cuckquean, Mark and Sandy",Unknown Author,,,,,"Mark and I were spending a relaxing Sunday together, ""hey pretty sissy"", he says. My cock is locked in a chrome cage, a pink panties cover it and wrap my ass in lace. On top I wear a strappy vest top, blue striped with some pink stitching in the hems. ""Sandy is coming around soon, I told her you're a cuckquean and she's up for cheating."" I feel my cock stretch against the cage.

""Mmmmh Mark that's so cute of you "", I say and kiss him hard, his tongue slips into my mouth and we make out hungrily. We only stop when Sandy arrives, for me to let her in. ""Hey Sandy thanks for coming, this will be such fun.""

""I know,"" she replies, ""Mark's so hot, I'm going to love this, you cucky little thing."" We embrace tightly.

The three of us move to the bedroom. Sandy starts to make herself more comfortable, and I turn to Mark and we kiss again. But I get soon down on my knees and undo his trousers, and ease him out of them along with his underwear, exposing his dick which I have ridden so many times before. But not today, now I kiss it, feeling it soft, but a gentle pressure resists against my lips. I lick his shaft, as his cock grows, until I can slide the head between my lips, sloppily sucking him into my mouth. His hardness excites me and again my dick swells inside the little trap, and my boi pussy twitches wanting Mark to take it.

""Get up,"" he commands. I obey, then he slides his hands into the top of my thong, running them smoothly over my ass as he takes down my panties, his hands feel so good on my curves. He holds my key and unlocks the small padlock. ""Say please sissy.""

""Please Daddy.""

With my ass bare, he removes the cock cage and gently releases my sacks from the ring. ""Mmmmh thank you Daddy."" I feel free and ready to be cucked.

Now his hand is on my boi clit, and I sense myself responding, his hand wrapping me gently, as my erection grows within, obediently. Gentle teasing strokes, Mark's hand feels good on my dick, I feel weak and ready to cum, I could cum for him so easily. ""Good girl you want this, I can tell"". He is right I do, I want it so badly. Mark kisses me on the lips, and lets go of my cock, ""I'm going to fuck Sandy now.""

""Mmmmh yes please,"" I beg.

Sandy is already on the bed, in bra and panties set, she wiggles her hips at Mark invitingly. He crawls over her, and pulls at her panties sliding them off, I slide mine down too, and kneel at the bed side. Mark's cock is hard and ready, I watch it approach her pussy, Sandy uses two fingers to guide Mark's manhood towards her waiting hole. As Mark takes her my ass clenches in jealousy and I start touch myself, feeling my cock against the skin of my hand.

Sandy thrusts up towards Mark taking him deep, her pussy stretched by his pounding dick, ""mmmh yes babe', she moans.

I stroke, horny for her pleasure wishing Mark was fucking me, but so turned on that he is fucking someone else, right in front of me.

My cock is so hard, and I try to slow down, my clit wet and sticky with ooze. Aching for Mark to be inside me, instead he is pounding Sandy. And she is fucking him back, her hips thrusting firmly around him, taking him, ""it's what you want isn't it Sissy,"" she torments me, ""to give a man what he wants, taking him deeply. Watch me bitch, watch me take his cum, my pussy, so much sweeter than your sissy cuckquean hole.""

I nearly loose my load, her words are cruel, Mark's dick is deep in her sweet hole, and I want denial, her sweet pussy, not for me, his beautiful cock, not for me. I'm so hard stroking my cock, a little quckquean bitch.

They drive together fast, sweating desperate for one another, fucking and fucking, until suddenly he is cumming, ""god yes"", says Mark, ""so fuck..i..ng gooood"". Then I begin to ejaculate, my rock hard cock, and my denied ass, cumming so hard. As Mark pumps his cheating load into Sandy, my load pumps out, ""oh god it feels so good to be with you and be denied, mmmmh fuck yes.""

They kiss through his orgasm, warmly embracing, meanwhile my mess dribbling out of my cock. I try to clean up a bit. I tuck my clit back behind my little panties. Mark withdraws from Sandy, leaving her full and wanting to cum. He walks up to me and strokes his fingers through my hair, gripping and moving my head towards his subsiding erection, ""kiss it."" I pucker my lips and kiss, then sloppy, letting my tongue wrap around the cock which I sucked so sluttily earlier and which fucked Sandy good, but not me, ""mmmh I love it Mark"", tasting Sandy's pussy on him. ""Good girl"", he praises, I feel his hand move slightly, a firm rub of my head. I relax under his control. ""Sandy needs you now, crawl to her"".

Dutifully I crawl towards her, she also uses a hand on my head to guide me towards her. To her pussy, but she stops me just short, and looks up to Mark, who is now behind me. I hear the sound of lube, on his fingers, and in anticipation my rosebud twitches, I move my hips, pushing out my ass, making small encouraging circles with my butt. So available.

His fingers touch in my crack, sliding down to the hole, tingling I push back involuntarily, ""whore"", I think to myself. And he is on my rosebud, circling it and it feels amazing, ""please fuck me"", I beg still moving my hips.

""No cucky,"" says Mark, ""no sex for you"" only jerking and fingering,"" my bud clenches, excitedly, denied. ""Ok Daddy, please, push in, I want your fingers, teasing me, in me.""

""Sssh baby girl, sssh.""

I feel pressure and then his finger enters me, just a little, ""Mmmmh daddy.""

His finger makes circles and my boi pussy feels good. He continues running his finger around my sissy hole, inside and outside, and I love it.

Sandy wiggles her legs wide open, and I lean in and kiss her pubic bone, slowly kissing my way towards her pretty pussy. Warmth. Dampness. I kiss over her clit and my tongue explores her crack, which parts, and my tongue meets her wetness. I run my tongue to her clit briefly, and then slide towards her hole to clean the cum oozing out. The cream pie, all for sissy. Then I work her clit with my tongue, Mark matches me, working my hole with his fingers, I'm so turned on, my ass getting played with while my tongue plays with Sandy's clit.

Again my tongue works towards her vagina, more of Mark's seed has made its way to her entrance, sucking and slurping, more cream pie. Then more work on Sandy's clit, while she wriths on my tongue, groaning and humping my face. But not too fast we don't want her to cum before I have properly cleaned her cunt.

My role as service sissy carries on, clit, cream, cleaner and cleaner. My mouth vacuums up Mark's load. The load I helped generate earlier with my cock hungry mouth warming him up.

Sandy's vag gradually seems to stop flowing cream, ""ready?"", I ask.

""Let's do this""

I kiss her clit passionately, winding my tongue around it more frantically. She thrusts and bucks, ""oooh yes sissy eat it.""

""Yes Miss Sandy"", I affirm, greedy licking her sex, riding her thrusts, until, ""Yeees fuck yes bitch!"" she exclaims. Now I know she is climaxing, her using my mouth just as she pleases, while Mark caresses my asshole and I ride waves of pleasure from end to end, two sissy holes, whore mouth to whore ass.

Sandy's bucks slowly subside and she goes still, expelling a final moan. I kiss her sex deeply one last time. Mark stops touching mine. Waves of desire and denial run through my cuckquean body. Sandy and Mark, lovers, both satisfied, me unfucked, but still loosing my load. We all take showers, Sandy first then Mark and I share, his manly hands on my body, we clean intimately. And then rest and chill, all together, peacefully

https://www.literotica.com/s/divine-poker-ch-03,Divine Poker Ch. 03,Unknown Author,,,,,"I've enjoyed writing this story. I realized as I was writing A Divine Gift that the power was just too open ended to make for a good story. It was sort of the Superman problem. A nice lesson for an author. So this is sort of revisiting the same world with a powered down and more limited protagonist. Hopefully you guys enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed writing it.

---

Kennedy and I hit it off very quickly. Turns out we had a lot in common. We'd come from relatively sheltered backgrounds but neither of us had succumbed to the ""wild oats sewing"" that was so prevalent in Las Vegas.

""I just needed to get away, you know.""

I nodded, her husband had been a real piece of work but he'd made her sign a pre-nup that had ended up protecting her more than him as it turns out. Kennedy's family wasn't rich but they were pretty well off. And her ex-husband's embarrassment over the way he was caught got her to trade a non-disclosure agreement in exchange for a pretty healthy alimony check.

""Don't tell anyone though. I've already broken the NDA just by telling you,"" she said, leaning forward conspiratorially.

I made a zip and lock motion on my mouth and said, ""Your secret is safe with me, ma'am.""

She giggled then her soft brown eyes tracked behind me, suddenly distracted. I knew the look. I glanced over my shoulder and instantly saw the objection that stole her attention. It was a blonde waitress who was absolutely stacked. ""She'd look good with her legs wrapped around you,"" Kennedy said.

It had taken some getting used to but Kennedy had a very odd sexuality brought out in her by God's quirky rules. She got off on dating someone and watching them with other women. Plus she liked girls herself. In truth, while I'd kissed Kennedy and we'd had intimate moments including sleeping together our first night. I'd yet to actually have sex with her. She seemed more turned on by the idea of me rejecting her in favor of other women. Okay, I say it had taken some getting used to but, honestly, I still wasn't used to it yet. It was weird. Hot... but weird.

Kennedy raised her hand and the waitress walked over, ""Hi, I'm Harper, how can I help you?"" she asked in a happy, perky voice. Something about it struck me as affected but this was no place to bore into her psyche.

""I just want a diet soda... what about you, honey?"" Kennedy said, batting her eyes at me and stroking my hand.

""Two, I guess. Too early to start drinking,"" I said.

""We have screwdrivers and mimosas,"" Harper said helpfully.

""That's fine. Thank you though,"" I said. She looked slightly deflated, probably anticipating a small tip, but walked away without further incident.

""Wouldn't you like to just bury your face in those big ol' tits of hers?"" Kennedy asked.

I looked her dead in the eye and said, ""I'd rather titty fuck her. I don't think yours are big enough for that.""

Kennedy rolled her eyes and moaned, squirming in her seat in frustration. One of the things I'd learned is that she really seemed to like it when I compared her unfavorably to other women. She drew the line at outright insults and she was very defensive about her intelligence. But mentioning a girl's bigger tits or tighter pussy got her really turned on. Still, I was finding it to be a slightly frustrating situation. She seemed like a really cool girl that I enjoyed hanging out with but her lack of interest in actual intimacy had me feeling weirdly rejected. I know... I know... It sounds ridiculous but trust me, when you like a girl, you want to have physical intimacy with her and even if she's actively throwing other girls at you, it still feels a bit like rejection. Like she's friend zoning you. A feeling made all the worse and more confusing by her insistence in calling me her boyfriend.

We got our drinks and made small talk. Kennedy told me about her ex and all the difficulties she had with him. He seemed like a real piece of work. Abusive and manipulative and, apparently, disloyal and dumb.

""It just pisses me off, you know. I mean... come to me and tell me, right? I'm your wife. Talk to me!"" she said. She paused for a moment, lips wrapping seductively around her straw as she took a sip of her drink. She looked up at me through long eyelashes, teasing me with her every glance and gesture. ""I mean... I've never done anything like that before. But it was hot, you know. I'm sure if he'd asked me, I'd have been up for it.""

I took my own sip, thinking about her words, ""You've never been with a girl before?""

She blushed and looked away for a moment, ""I mean... I've thought about it... I guess... I never did it before because it just didn't do much for me. But thinking about him bringing her home and fucking her is just so damn hot.""

""Too bad it went the other way,"" I said. Kennedy looked at me and a cute, crooked smile formed across her lips.

""I wouldn't say it's bad at all. I'd rather find out my asshole husband was also a liar sooner rather than later,"" she reached across the table and stroked my hand. ""Besides, I'd rather have an open, honest relationship with a man like you. I think you get me, Phillip.""

It seemed like whatever had happened to her fundamentally changed the way she was looking at men, sex, relationships... everything. When she talked about her ex, you could hear the difference. I looked at her and decided if she wanted an honest relationship then I needed to be honest with her too.

""Kennedy, can I tell you two things?""

""Sure.""

""First, I like you. And I'm glad you want to be my girlfriend,"" I said.

""Me too,"" she said, staring at me with a weirdly adoring look. It was, frankly, unnerving.

""And don't get me wrong... your little... you know... kink... is hot.""

""You like that don't you, stud,"" she said leaning forward. ""You like that your girlfriend gets off watching you fuck little blonde sluts?""

My eyes darted up to Harper who was two tables away but she apparently didn't hear us. I looked back at Kennedy and said, ""Yes... but I think a boyfriend and girlfriend should share some sort of physical intimacy, don't you?""

Kennedy looked at me then looked away. When she turned back, she looked almost scared. ""Phillip, I don't know if I'm ready for that.""

I was taken aback. Of all the reasons to give me, that wasn't the one I expected. ""Truthfully, Kennedy, I'm not either. I know this is going to sound weird but I'm a pretty traditional guy.""

She laughed but then stopped when she saw the look on my face. ""Nothing about the last 48 hours has seemed very traditional to me. You some kind of bible thumper?""

Now I chuckled, ""No... definitely not. My parents were, I guess... or are. I've had my eyes opened to a lot of worldly delights... especially since meeting Jaime and now you. You'd probably call me a lapsed Catholic... if I was Catholic.""

""So you want me to be... what?""

""My girlfriend. I like you. I want to get to know you... and... well... I want to get to KNOW you if you know what I mean."" Kennedy looked at me and blushed, averting her gaze again. She bit her lip then looked back at me, seeming to make up her mind about something. I watched as she pushed her plate over to my side of the table then sexily slid out of her side and onto mine. She snuggled up next to me, pressing her warm, smooth legs against mine as she nuzzled under my arm, guiding it over her shoulder.

""Better?"" she said, purring into my ear.

""Yes,"" I said, my eyes unable to tear themselves away from the wide expanse of cleavage that her tight, black v-neck was revealing. She looked up, seeing where my eyes were and smiled.

""See something you like?"" she asked. Her finger reached up and pulled the v-neck down slightly, revealing the lacy white bra underneath. I could see her nipples poking through.

""Very much,"" I said. Then I considered her kink that I'd apparently given her somehow and whispered, ""A woman's got to keep her man happy or he might stray.""

She let out a little squeak of a whimper before whispering back, ""What if I want my man to stray? Doesn't that mean I should hold out on him? Keep him horny and frustrated?""

""Sure.. if you want him to be unhappy and constantly annoyed with you. But then he wouldn't be your boyfriend very long would he? You don't want him to leave you for another woman, do you?""

She shook her head, biting her lip sexily as she did. ""No... I want him to always come back to me,"" she said in a high pitched, innocent voice.

""Then you better keep him happy,"" I said, looking down at her. She nodded, still biting her lip. Again, she seemed to pause as she considered something then she glanced around for just a moment before sliding her hand onto my lap. Her fingers traced my hard cock through my shorts, stroking it gently. It surged under the touch of her fingers and my breath caught. Kennedy looked up at me and our lips in a gentle, soft kiss.

""I'm sorry... I'll do everything I can to keep you happy,"" she said softly.

""I don't want it to be a chore, Kennedy. I just think we're better off being friends and not boyfriend and girlfriend if you don't find me attractive.""

She sniffed a little but kept stroking my cock, ""I do find you attractive Phillip. Very attractive. It wouldn't be hot to me for you to cheat on me if I didn't also find you attractive.""

""You're so weird,"" I said and gasped as she gripped my cock.

Her giggle arrived in my ear and moments later her hot, warm breath was whispering again, ""I know. I wasn't like this before I met you. But, God, something about you just does it for me you big stud.""

Her words reminded me of the other thing I wanted to tell her though it was pretty hard to concentrate at the moment. ""About that, Kennedy. I just... well... I'm worried that I did this to you,"" I said.

She laughed in my ear before gently licking the lobe with her moist tongue. Yup. Very hard to concentrate. ""Why are you worried about that? I'm happy you did. I was miserable a couple days ago. Whatever you did to make me obsessed with watching you pound little blonde sluts like Jaime you can do anytime.""

It was getting hard not to moan out as her stroking of my cock became more insistent. ""Well... it's just... I think it's more than that. The poker game...,""

""Stop worrying,"" she said, interrupting me, ""Go with it. I'm happy, Phillip. And very wet,"" she said. Her tongue tickled at my ear, sending shivers down my spine that ended surging into my cock. ""Do you want to fuck your girlfriend?""

""Very much,"" I said.

""Even though my tits aren't big like that slut?""

I nodded as she continued to stroke my shaft.

""And my pussy isn't as tight as Jaime's?""

""No,"" I choked out. ""Hers is so much tighter.""

""And you even fucked that slut's ass and I'd be way too scared to let you do that to me,"" she said. She squeezed my cock tightly, reminding me about just how tight Jaime's perfect little ass had been around my cock. ""So what can I offer you?,"" she asked. The tone change was marked. The sexy, flirtiness that had been there before had been replaced by a genuine earnestness.

""Affection, intimacy, companionship?"" I said.

She paused her stroking to look at me, ""That's not sex,"" she said. Her tone was neutral, searching.

""Intimacy is,"" I said.

""So you don't want to... you know... fuck me? You want to just... make love to me?"" the words came out haltingly, as if the very idea of them left her confused and dismayed. It was like watching a robot short circuit right in front of my eyes.

I couldn't think of any words to say so I just did what seemed natural. I leaned forward and kissed her. My lips gently played along hers for a moment and I wasn't sure whether she was even going to reciprocate. Then I felt her mouth open slightly. My tongue slid along her lips and then felt hers. It was like electricity. She sighed softly into the kiss and her body melted into mine as we made out not like two lust fueled teenagers but rather as intimate lovers.

The waitress, long forgotten, came back with our drinks. I saw her watching us quietly for a moment. She had an almost longing look to her. She opted not to say anything and simply walked away, leaving us to enjoy our private intimacy in a very public location. Kennedy finally placed her hands on my chest and pushed me gently away. I took some pride in the fact that she was breathing quite heavily as she tried to replenish her oxygen levels. Frankly, the heavy breathing was pretty pleasant to look at as well.

""That was... wow...,"" she said.

""That's how a boyfriend should kiss a girlfriend.""

""Yeah?... Yeah...,"" she said, still struggling for words. I smiled, taking a sip of my drink and looking around at the casino. Kennedy followed my gaze as we looked out across the sea of people. For all the glam and glitz of Vegas, if you lived there long enough, you started to become inured to it. The loud, fat lady with a glittering cowboy hat didn't grab your attention anymore. Your eyes skipped right past the 70 year old man wearing a leisure suit and showing off more chest hair than Magnum PI. Even the gorgeous 22 year old red head on the old man's arm didn't hold your attention for much longer.

No, what stood out was the almost ordinary. The casual. The thing you missed seeing from your hometown. That's why my gaze fell on the couple sitting only a few tables away. I couldn't tell much about the man. He looked to be about my height with well coiffed hair that looked like it was encased in hair spray. He was built about my size though his taste in clothes clearly trended towards the preppy with a purple polo shirt and khakis.

It was his girlfriend... or wife... or sister? That caught my eye, however. Beautiful long blonde hair framed her face. She had high cheekbones that made me think of conquering Vikings. She was dressed much more casually than the man and looked like she was either coming from or heading to a workout. The two were in some sort of rather animated discussion at the moment but I was unable to make out much of the conversation. As I watched, the conversation seemed to grow more animated until finally the man's voice elevated to the point where I could hear him say, ""Piper... I just don't know what you want from me. Tell me what you want.""

He took her hands in his and raised them up, cupping them with his own. I couldn't hear the blonde's response but her lips were easy to read. ""I don't know.""

He stood up and started to walk away from her and towards our table. Most of the eyes in the dining area were turned to the couple now. He looked nervously before saying, ""Call me when you figure it out Piper. I love you. I'll do anything you want."" I couldn't help glancing around and noting the varied reactions. Several guys of varying ages were shaking their heads. One little old lady clutched her hands to her chest and seemed to melt at the lovestruck words. Another girl wearing a leather jacket and a giant nose ring rolled her eyes and laughed with her friends.

Piper simply stared at him, not able to say anything. She looked around at the eyes watching her personal life unfold in such a public way and couldn't think of anything to say. She just looked at him creating a horrible, awkward silence. He stood watching for almost a minute before finally turning and walking away.

""What was that all about?"" Kennedy asked me.

I shrugged, ""No idea. Seemed like a bad breakup though.""

""That means she's single now,"" Kennedy said, eyes twinkling.

""Keep it in your pants,"" I said and Kennedy stuck her tongue out at me in response. ""She just broke up. I don't like being a rebound.""

""Why not? She probably needs a good lay and you already have a girlfriend. A rebound girl sounds perfect to me,"" she whispered in my ear. She also stroked my cock. She already knew how to get me in the mood. Her idea did have merit. I wasn't looking to date this girl. Simply to have a little fun.

I screwed up my courage and slid out of the booth. Kennedy started to follow and I turned back, ""Nope. You just get to watch today.""

She bit her lip and nodded. She wasn't the only one who's learned someone's buttons. I walked away, knowing that Kennedy was squirming in her seat as she watched me approach the young lady. As I got closer, I realized she was younger than I thought. She was probably 19 or 20. Definitely still in college. ""Do you mind if I sit here?"" I asked.

""Kinda,"" she said, ""In case you're the only person that didn't notice my boyfriend just left me.""

""Did he? It seemed like you didn't really give him a reason to stay,"" I said cautiously.

Her eyes snapped to mine and there was a fire there. ""Is that what you think?""

""I don't really think anything. That's why I came over. To see if I could help.""

""And how can you help,"" she asked, looking at me intently as she sipped on the mug in her hand.

I'm not sure what made me say it but suddenly I found myself holding the pack of cards that had been in my pocket, twirling them between my fingers. ""I can be a very good listener. Tell you what, we'll play a hand of poker. If I win, you let me listen to your story. If you win, you can decide if I stay or go. Okay?""

""No date attached or something? Really shooting high with this one aren't you?"" she said, her mouth curling into a snarky smile of disdain.

""Maybe I'm just confident in my powers of listening?""

She rolled her eyes but didn't turn me away. She watched me for a minute and I gave her my best smile. ""Aren't you here with that girl over there?"" she asked, finally.

""I am. That's my friend Kennedy. She wanted me to come over and talk to you,"" I said.

""Really?"" Piper asked full of skepticism.

""Truly. Give her a little wave. You won't see any animosity or anger on her part,"" I said confidently. Piper raised her hand, wiggling her fingers in a tentative wave. I didn't bother to look behind me. I could imagine how Kennedy responded. ""Satisfied?""

""I guess. She's really just a friend?""

""More of a 'it's complicated' situation,"" I said as I rifled through the cards, shuffling them quickly. I liked the rhythmic sounds of the shuffle and bridge. Piper seemed to accept my non-explanation and watched as the cards rose and fell in my hands. I'd made tens of thousands of shuffles with these kinds of cards and could probably do it blindfolded in my sleep while underwater. ""Five card draw?"" I asked.

""Are you a pro?"" she asked, suddenly very skeptical.

""I'm trying to be. I'm not there yet though,"" I replied with a smile. Hopefully a disarming smile.

""How about we just play texas hold'em?"" she asked. Without betting, hold'em was a completely luck based game. Not that five card draw had all that much skill involved but at least it was a little.

I shrugged, ""Suit yourself,"" I said. Either God wanted me to win this or he didn't. That part was out of my hands. I finished dealing and offered her the cut.

She grabbed the cards in her long fingers and said, ""Can I deal? I'd hate to get hustled by a card shark.""

""Sure,"" I said. Boy she was cautious. Either that or a real control freak. I looked at her and watched as she dealt the cards carefully. She was clearly not practiced at it and nearly flipped over my second card. It wouldn't have mattered much since we weren't betting but it still made me grind my teeth a little bit. I slid my cards up and looked at them, a Jack and a deuce. Not the worst hold 'em hand but pretty bad.

""I guess we could just show them, huh?"" she asked.

I shrugged again, ""Sure. Takes away the excitement though.""

""Nahh... the winning and losing is the fun,"" she replied, smirking at me and giving me a little wink.

I showed my cards and she laughed before revealing first one, then a second Ace. If you haven't played Texas Hold'em, this is what we would call a ""bad beat"" just waiting to happen. The odds were definitely not in my favor. She looked at me and smiled, ""Want to raise the stakes?""",,2025-08-15T19:00:11.905594,3661,
https://www.literotica.com/s/denial-slut-learns-to-cuck-ch-13,Denial Slut Learns to Cuck Ch. 13,Unknown Author,,,,,"It seemed like it had been the longest winter ever, but it was finally in the low 70s and the sky was the picturesque blue with billowing white clouds you could almost touch. This weather always brought out my playful side, and I woke up feeling so happy. I had completed my initial morning tasks, given Sir his wake-up blow job, and as he does every Sunday, he fell right back asleep. I also grabbed the newspaper and set it outside Blair's room. She was not a morning person like Sir and I, so she prefers quiet alone time before coming out.

I ran into the bedroom and hopped onto the bed, landing just short of ending up on top of Sir. He rolled over and his back was now to me. I bounced on my knees giggling and chanting, ""wakey wakey, Sir!"" He grumbled and turned towards me, a grumpy look on his face. I gave him a look that was equally as adorable as his was irritated and watched as his eyes lightened and his grimace softened into a smile. ""You can't even be mad at me, Sir. I'm too cute, and it's way too nice out!""

""I might not be able to stay angry, sweetie, but I need not be upset with you to torment you."" He smirked as my giggles quickly faded to a singular gasp of arousal and fear. ""Am I mistaken?""

""No, Sir. You can torment me for any reason you like."" I responded, knowing I was sealing my fate and ensuring my torture would take place today. I loved the way the lust and trepidation blended together to intoxicate me, to make me putty in his hands. I adored feeling pliable. It is effortless to be malleable for Sir; I am beholden to obey his every desire, compelled to please him in every way I can. To do so brings tranquility. Besides, I am a complete perv, and it makes my slit leak to imagine what he might do to me.

I was going to find out just how much fun Sir wanted to have today, and it was possibly a little more than I was prepared for.

""Go get your we-vibe and the inflatable plug."" He was stern. It was no time for me to push.

""Yes Sir. Which plug Sir?"" Yes, we owned more than one inflatable butt plug! ""The vibrating one."" ""Yes, Sir."" ""With the remote.""

""Yes Sir."" I walked purposefully to the playroom across the hall and grabbed the items I was told to retrieve. I was starting to get excited. Two remote controlled items were better than one, right? I had no idea.

I arrived back to the master bedroom to find Sir standing at the foot of the bed. I placed the toys near his hand and kneeled at his feet.

Sir gestured for me to bend over the bed, ass in the air, legs spread, both holes available for intrusion. Before he even touched me, I was whining.

""Do you have a question? Anything you'd like to ask before I begin?"" Sir rarely offered me to opportunity to make requests prior to scenes. Well, he rarely denied the asking of any questions in general, but to actively make a point of offering hinted that there might be something I may want to ask.

""Um, Sir, I haven't gone to the bathroom yet today. May I please go wee before I am filled?"" It had been a couple months since Sir had discovered, i.e. I had exposed, my fetish for omorashi, the forced holding of urine, being denied release until almost wetting oneself, or for many enthusiasts, eventual self-wetting is unavoidable. I was not so interested in the wetting portion, but the being made to hold it, forced water intake, the panic that coincides, and knowing that whether or not I was completely humiliated and brought to the point of failing to control even the most basic of my bodily functions was in Sir's control. Since my confession of my omorashi fetish, I have been required to get permission to relieve myself. Of course, since I can not even make such a simple decision, I could not possibly be expected to use what Sir calls ""big girl"" words to ask either. He knows it brings me down another level to have to ask to go ""wee.""

""No, of course you may not go wee, sweetie, but I am so glad you asked. Go grab a depends unless you want to chance going out in big girl panties."" I gasped in pure dread. I did not want in any way to wet myself. It was not a limit, but I liked to think I had all these caveats that Sir would respect about how a scene with that would happen if it ever did, but the only rule he religiously followed was: Don't break the toy. (Respect limits.) Degrading and humiliating me would be of no concern to him. Shit, he'd get off on it.

I ran to get the adult diapers he made me buy, but had never made me wear. It had to be better than having an obvious accident. Hopefully it would only be us who knew it was even on my body. I placed it next to the toys and kneeled again. He began again, ""Over the bed. Any final questions?"" I had none other than the one I had already requested, and his answer was quite clear. ""No, thank you, Sir."" I timidly replied.

Sir inserted the plug first, opting benevolently to leave it in its base deflated state. Next was the we-vibe. He made sure it was placed just right, the inside sitting right against my g-spot and the outer piece sitting firmly between my lips and centered directly on my newly captive clitoris. Testing his handiwork, Sir paired the vibrator and turned it on. I was fucked. So fucked. He put on the diaper and I was mortified just to be wearing it, and we hadn't even left the house. Finally I donned my day collar that is more subtle for use in the vanilla world. It is made of sterling silver, and like any decent collar, it requires a key to unlock. Sir has it on his keys and a spare at home. He locked my badge of submission, the token of his ownership securely around my throat.

We went on with our relatively uneventful morning until we decided to go out for a picnic in the park. It was so gorgeous and Sir knew how much both Blair and I loved this weather. But Blair is a coffee fiend, so she wanted to go to Starbucks first, and Sir was feeling giving today, so he claimed. We sat on the patio and I told Sir I wasn't thirsty when he asked what I'd like to drink. He blamed the humidity, but we both knew it was forced drinking to make my bladder fuller, but he did not let me skip a beverage. He just confirmed my response and headed to the barista inside.

When he returned, he had two regular sized cups of coffee, or whatever Blair was drinking today. A red eye or Americano. I can't keep it all straight. All I know for sure is that Sir had ordered iced coffee for me, but he had gotten a trenta size! Thirty-one ounces! On an empty bladder, that would be too much, but Sir was sending me a strong message. I received it loud and clear. I would not try to cheat my way into making my suffering less. It was for his enjoyment. Usually I get iced tea, but I am sure Sir picked coffee for its diuretic effect. Great.

Blair and Sir began sipping their drinks. Sir watched as I fidgeted, afraid to drink my coffee. He raised his eyebrows, imploring me to drink. My pulse became more rapid as I fidgeted even more. I felt pressure building inside my asshole. I immediately started drinking, understanding exactly what was happening. The plug stopped inflating, but it did not deflate, nor did I expect it to. I silently cursed myself for not having just drank when I knew I was expected to. Now there would be additional pressure too.

Blair laughed at my discomfort, and I knew immediately who had control of my ass. I looked at Sir, jaw agape, shocked that he had shared my dilemma with her. Why I was surprised I truly don't know, because she was only around to be his and to add to my suffering for him. I could feel my cheeks flush with heat as she enjoyed seeing my enlightenment.

I closed my mouth and looked at Sir, relaxing any tension from my brows and lips especially. I wanted to show reverence and not make my suffering worse in the wrong ways, only the ones he enjoyed. I could see the approval in his eyes and in the nod of his head toward the twenty-eight or so ounces still remaining to drink of the giant coffee. I drank through the familiar green straw without breaking eye contact, and it reminded me of earlier today when I took Sir in my mouth. I think all three of us must have had the same thought all at once, because as I sucked every drop of coffee through that straw, Sir turned on the inner vibe very low, just rolling like a wave, and I felt the rear vibrator awaken at the exact same time. I had to work to not let my arousal become audible or obvious to anyone around us. Keeping my hips still was damn near impossible. I drank the whole trenta, though, and upon the final sip, all vibration ceased, leaving not only the oversized Starbucks cup, but also both of my tight holes feeling so empty.

""Shall we head off then to the square?"" Sir asked eagerly, as if he had something else planned. Of course he did. He always did.

Upon standing, I felt the weight of my now very full bladder, and gravity's additional pressure made no attempt to ease my burden. It seemed that would only happen in one way that I was dreading.

At the park, Sir, ever prepared, pulled out a blanket and sat down on it. He tapped the space to his right, inviting Blair to join him, and I stupidly sat down on his other side. ""You sit on the grass. I don't need an extra mess to clean up because I let my bitch piss on my blanket."" I felt my status shift lower than it had at any point so far in this scene upon his words. I knelt on the grass, eyes lowered in shame.

Blair came over and mock comforted me, saying, ""It's okay, girl. Come here. Lay back."" I laid on my back, hyper aware of my surroundings and utterly convinced everyone was watching. ""Good girl."" Blair accompanied her praise with a loving, heh, belly rub, but she focused all pressure directly on my lower abdomen, making my need to urinate more intense.

I had to work to not grit my teeth in disrespect for her at her cruelty, and instead I uttered a simple, ""Thank you, Miss.""

She must have sensed my difficulty to remain in my place, or perhaps wanted to see me struggle more to maintain focus, because the anal plug began to expand. She smiled as I jumped at the surprise, and she turned the vibrator on too. I began to melt into my happy place as their anal slut.

Next I knew, I felt a very subtle pulse, almost a ghost of a vibration, so faint in its strength that I silently questioned whether or not it was in my head or was actually happening. Until it began to build that is. It was beginning on the g-spot head of the we-vibe and increasing in speed and intensity, ultimately shifting to the clit only piece of the toy at the height of the vibrational intensity. That was where the duration of the pattern was the longest as well, but alas, it was nowhere near long enough to let me even think about approaching the edge of orgasmic bliss. It fell just short, got me up to the point of believing that I could have it before ripping that hopelessly from my consciousness. Then the pattern began again, bringing me just to the brink then nothing! I was so frustrated. It mattered not how many times I was tortured like this; the hellish possession that nugatory optimism held over me was unshakable.

As I struggled to remain unnoticeable by the public, Sir began to empty his backpack onto the blanket. I realized, when he said picnic, he was not exaggerating one bit, as he pulled out a bottle of champagne, three lemon poppy muffins from our favorite bakery in town, a package of blueberry goat cheese, and some crackers. He was so sweet sometimes. Sometimes I was confused by my feelings of adoration and absolute contempt in certain moments when I thought I had pushed as far as I could for him. But he always knew. He knows how much I can do, and he shows me I can and will be the best version of myself for him.

""Fucktoy."" I snapped to attention at the sound of his sharp tone. ""I asked you a question. I do not enjoy repeating myself.""

""I am so sorry Sir. I was caught up thinking about you actually."" I squeaked my apology, a bit embarrassed that I had been caught off in la la land daydreaming about the man right in front of me.

""You are so lucky you are cute. And that I am in a good mood. I expect your focus on me, not your thoughts of me. Is that clear, young lady?"" He knows that it makes me feel extra cared for when he calls me young lady. It is a particularly intimate honorific to receive from Sir.

""Yes, Sir. Crystal."" I smiled at him, knowingly. He smiled back with an equally knowing nod of the head.

""Then I will repeat my question this once. Would you like some brunch?""

""Thank you and yes please Sir.""

He tapped the blanket, indicating I may come sit beside him on the blanket now. He dropped a couple crumbs as he proceeded to split a muffin in half, and after helping himself, he put a crumb into my mouth. Sure to press his first two fingers down on the back of my tongue, he clearly wanted me to read into this feeding. I sucked his fingers as he slowly removed them. I felt the vibrators turn on, but this time all three motors were active simultaneously.

It was more than I could bare, and I squirmed and audibly moaned. Neither Sir nor Blair reacted. Well, that is not entirely true. Blair gave the inflatable butt plug a couple of pumps. The exhausting torment continued for quite some time, perhaps ten minutes or so. During this time, Sir must have uncorked the bubbly, because when the ministrations inside my most sensitive parts ceased, there were three red solo cups full of champagne. I looked at Sir trying to figure out what he really expected me to do.

See, you must understand, I am not a drinker. No, I am no addict, unless being addicted to dick counts, but I digress. I have a chronic pain disorder that is worsened by alcohol. In this moment, I was a little bit concerned that Sir was not only going to require me to drink, but to drink alcohol. I am not that brand of masochist. But he pulled out the second glass bottle of the incredible Martinelli's non-alcoholic apple cider! How thoughtful he was! But now I had absolutely no way of getting out of having to hold more in my bladder.

It was starting to get incredibly difficult to not dance out of desperation. As Sir handed me the red solo cup, he told me to be still. I stopped my potty dance and began drinking, knowing that arguing or delaying the torment would only make it worse when I finally began.

So I drank and dripped and vibrated and wished with every single part of my being that Sir would not make me wet myself, that he would allow me the use of a toilet in time. My heart rate was increasing as the panic of the situation began setting in. The cider had done it, and I was now on the verge of having an accident, me, a full grown woman, in public!

""Aww, do you need something?"" Blair mocked sympathy, surely an act that resulted in not only mine but also her clit to become more engorged with arousal. ""I need to go wee so bad, Miss. Please please may I go use a toilet? Please, Miss?""

""You do not need a toilet, remember, mine? You are dressed for the occasion, and we will be here until you have emptied yourself twice.""

I swear my heart stopped for several seconds. I had to have heard him wrong. ""Yes, I am as serious as a heart attack. Now do not have one."" He chuckled at his own joke. ""The sooner you empty yourself, accepting that you are so pathetic to not even be able to have self control enough to hold your own piss, the sooner we may begin the process again. We can fill you up and make you squirm so adorably, and then watch your need fall to utter devastation as you recognize the failure you are.""

I looked down, unable to meet his gaze. I was mortified to have to do this task, but I focused on letting my pelvic floor muscles relax and let go of both my wee and all dignity and control. The vibrators got pumped and switched all the way up. Everything was maxed out. I have never had a more blissful pee. I edged so damn hard and felt the way my muscles just clenched and twitched more than any piss I had ever taken.

All I wanted and truly needed was to cum, but all pleasurable feelings ceased to continue.",,2025-08-15T19:00:19.959267,3053,
https://www.literotica.com/s/my-crazy-girlfriend-pt-01,My Crazy Girlfriend Pt. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"Liv and I went upstairs into the guest room after dinner with her family. She was wearing what she always wore, a colorful sundress. She was tall, nearly five-ten and very lean. I teased her by describing her as 'all elbows'. But teasing aside I love her slender profile, b-cups and tight butt. She was the cutest. Despite her cute appearance and playful personality, she was insatiable. So badly that she almost never returned to her dorm at school, filling her time out of class with me.

We were free with our sexuality, we didn't use safe words, or bother with boundaries. Neither of us had ever crossed a line with the other and we felt close enough that we would know if we had.

She walked to the bathroom, but I put fingers into her thick, long, copper mane and grabbed. She laughed through the wince and turned around. ""I have to pee."" She said.

""I know,"" I replied, ""I want to watch you dance.""

""You're so weird,"" She said with a smile and kissed me. ""But I need to discuss something with you, and I don't want to wait.""

""Oh,"" I said confused, ""Alright.""

She went into the bathroom and was gone for several moments and then came back out. I had sat on the bed and she climbed into my lap.

""So,"" she said, I looked into her big brown eyes. ""I may have volunteered you for a weird tradition.""

""If I have to wear a bad sweater in a photo you're going to pay.""

She shook her head. ""I have a fetish you don't know about, and I want you to help.""

""Name it."" I said. She took a deep breath like she was nervous and ran fingers through her hair.

""You know I'm down for anything, what's up?""

She sighed. ""I want you to fuck my sister.""

I laughed uncomfortably, ""No you don't.""

She pushed my shoulders laying me back on the bed. ""We call it the pass-back game, she's going to spend all weekend trying to seduce you, all you have to do is resist as long as possible. When you can't take it anymore, fuck her brains out.""

""You're serious."" I said, she leaned over me.

""I've wanted to do this since you came last year but was afraid it'd freak you out."" She gave me a soft kiss, ""You think she's hot, I know you do because you've told me. Plus, you totally checked her out at dinner.""

""I did-"" She put a finger over my lips.

""You're supposed to, it's part of the game."" She said, ""I know you love me, and are totally faithful, but I'm begging you. This is a bucket-list fantasy for me.""

""Fuck your sister."" I repeated.

She nodded with a straight face.

""This isn't some weird test, you actually want this to happen?"" She nodded again.

""Hold on until you can't take it anymore. Make her wear you down."" She said breathily. She kissed my neck playfully, ""Then take her hard and until you're empty.""

""This is a really big thing to spring on me during my second only visit to your family's house."" I said.

""I know,"" She said leaning forward, ""But I hoped you'd play along anyway. For me?"" She said with a pouty face.

""You want me to get seduced by your sister... for you."" I asked skeptically.

She nodded.

""Alright,"" I said in resignation. ""But you'll pay for this.""

She pecked me on the lips. From down stairs we heard their mother call, ""Movie's starting!""

""Come on."" She said excitedly getting up.

""I'll meet you down stairs in a minute."" I said.

""What's the hold up?"" She asked, I looked down. She giggled turning red. ""No one will notice, let's go.""

""Well, I'm going to change into PJs anyway."" I said.

""Ok, I'll save you a seat."" She said twirling to leave. Outside she talked to someone I couldn't hear as I began changing. I had just sat down to pull my pants off my legs when Maggie, Liv's younger sister suddenly walked in.

The nineteen-year-old blonde was shorter than her sister, with the same slender build. Her hips were wider than Liv's and unlike Liv- who was perennially pale, Maggie sported a healthy tan. For someone as petite as she was, her breasts seem to hang off her. They were too big for her chest and shoulders. She was barefoot, wearing just a spaghetti strap top and very tight, very short denim shorts.

""Hey Maggie,"" I said uncomfortably, standing in my boxers and polo shirt.

""Hey,"" she said back, ""Nice underwear."" I gave her a look. ""I can't get my zipper down; can you help me?""

""Your zipper?"" I asked quizzically.

She got very close to me, looking down, ""Yeah, I squeezed my ass into these shorts and now the zipper is stuck."" She lifted the hem of her top revealing her flat, bare stomach to show me the shorts.

""You can't be serious."" I said flatly. ""Get Liv or your mom to help.""

""They aren't strong enough to get this, plus my mom would just laugh at me. She hates these shorts. Come on!"" She begged.

""I guess."" I said reaching toward her. But she moved, turning around and leaning toward me.

""Awesome!"" She said, ""You got this."" Her back was to me, and her butt was pressed up against my lap and she held her hands out for me to work. I grabbed the button and forcibly pried it open. It was snuggly secured and took some leverage. I got the button opened and started on the zipper. I had to feel through the tight fabric on her lap to find the tab, sliding my fingers along the seam several times to find a way into the crease.

Her butt pushed into me firmly as I found the tab for the zipper. While I was feeling for it I thought I heard her gasp. I grabbed the tab in my fingers and started to pull. I tried moving away from her but she kept herself against me. I was fighting an erection as I struggled with the zipper. Her ass was firm and moving against me and I could see down her shirt and her big soft breasts pushing on her shirt.

I groaned internally, feeling myself rock hard against her. I had backed myself to the wall to stabilize myself and pushed as hard as I could with just my fingers. Finally, the zipper slid down the whole inch and a half of it. I pulled my hands away and sighed with relief. ""There you go."" I said.

""Thank you so much."" She said, a little breath to her voice. I waited for her to move but she didn't, her butt still pushed into me. ""Can I help you with anything?"" She asked looking back at me with a smile, moving her hips.

""N-no, I'm all set here."" I said.

She raised an eyebrow. ""Well, maybe I can return the favor later."" She smiled and left. I stood in the room startled and confused until my erection went away then put on pants and went down stairs.

I found Liv on the couch under a blanket that was thrown across her knees and shoulders. She smiled big when she saw me and pulled the blanket back to let me in. I climbed in and got close as she gave me a soft kiss.

We had kissed for only a few seconds when we were interrupted by Maggie, wearing tank top that was at least a size too small and soffe shorts almost as short as the ones I had just helped her out of.

""Are we doing PDA?"" She asked, ""Is this seat taken?"" and dropped into my lap.

""Whoa, Maggie."" I said startled. She wasn't heavy, but it was surprising.

""Ignore her,"" Liv said pulling me back into the kiss. Her eyes closed kissing me gently. Maggie began to move in my lap subtly. Kissing Liv can excite me on its own, but having Maggie's butt wiggling in my lap made it worse. I was rock hard again in seconds, and Maggie made sure I was aware that she noticed.

I tried to pull out of the kiss to ask Maggie to move, but Liv put a hand on my cheek, kissing me more firmly. I was so hard I could feel my boxers dabbing drops of fluid as Maggie squirmed quietly in my lap. There were footsteps at the stair case, and Maggie practically rolled to the other side of the couch.

Liv broke the kiss and touched her nose to mine, ""I love you."" She whispered.

""I love you too."" I said back, still feeling lost.

""Maybe when Maggie grows up she can be in love too."" Liv shot across the couch.

Their mother Diane came in, ""Liv be nice to Maggie."" Liv rolled her eyes. ""Ready to start?""

""What are we watching?"" I asked.

""Ugh,"" Maggie groaned, ""Ever since mom and dad split its probably some lame rom-com.""

""Maggie!"" Liv scolded.

""No, she's right."" Diane said. ""It is a rom com."" Diane moved the big chair outward to face the tv and sat down fiddling with the remote while Maggie got up and turned off the lights. The movie started, and we sat and watched.

Under the blanket, Liv threw her legs over my lap and laid on my shoulder. Under the blanket I felt the underside of her leg with my fingertips sliding up the back of her thigh. She gave me a sharp look. I ran the hand farther up under her dress and her eyes got wide and she looked at her mom and then back at me.

I teased her thigh with my fingers moving them up and down her lean thigh, watching her face. My hand slid between her legs and felt her panties, which were soaking wet. I ran my finger through her folds, soaking my finger in the wet fabric. She pushed her face into my shoulder and cried quietly.

I teased her, toying with her clit, rubbing and playing. Her eyes were heavy, and she was struggling to control her breathing. I moved the panties and ran my finger across her bare pussy. She covered her face with the blanket and gasped into her hand.

I slid my finger into her pussy and pulled it in and out. She grabbed my neck, pulling me closer as she tried to hide and stifle her moans. Her face was tented by her red hair as she panted against me. I fingered her faster, watching her delicate body respond and her sweet face struggle for control. I rubbed above her clit with my thumb as I fingered her and she started to shake, her pussy squeezing my finger.

She buried her face in the blanket, then my shoulder and quaked against me as orgasm rushed through her. When she came down, she looked at me with a submissive face before giving me an eager kiss. Her hands reached under her legs and felt my cock, which was achingly hard.

I shook my head at her. She nodded, untying the draw string on my pajamas under the blanket. ""It's too messy."" I whispered in her ear. She smiled back, pulling the waist down and grabbing my exposed shaft. I was slick from how erect I had been for so long and she pumped my cock aggressively, now her watching my face.

I shook my head insistently, my face already showing desperation as she stroked me. She smiled excitedly back, feeling my shaft pulse in her hand. Her other hand moved under the blanket. I didn't have to tell her, she knew how fast I'd be.

I took a hard breath and she leaned in close putting her face to mine as my cock seized shooting cum against the hand she had above it in a long series of bursts. She milked me through the orgasm, cum leaking down my shaft after eruption. She pulled the messy hand out of the blanket and licked cum off it with a smile, then used the hem of her dress to wipe off my shaft.

""I'll be right back,"" She said, ""I have to use the restroom. She got up and walked out of the room. I studied Maggie and Diane, neither seemed to know or have noticed a thing. Liv came back and snuggled with me again until the movie was over.

They chatted about it for a few minutes, then I announced my attention to shower, and Liv that she was going to turn in and we all broke for the evening. When we got to the room Liv and I laughed about our rotten behavior during the movie.

She leaned against me, leaning against the wall and gave me a long kiss. I held her sides as we kissed. She pulled away and said, ""Pull the string, so I can get this dress off."" She turned around showing me the string in the back. I pulled, and it came free the dress slacking across her lean frame. She wiggled slightly giving the garment a tug and it slowly slid from her shoulders and hips to the floor.

Once her delicate frame was exposed to just her bra and panties she leaned back moving her butt against me playfully. Maggie had done the same thing and I wondered if it was them or me. ""Play with me."" She said in a childish voice.

""I intend to,"" I said feeling her flat stomach, ""but can I shower first?"" I asked.

She shook her head throwing long red hair across her shoulders, ""No, fuck me dirty."" She reached down and pulled her panties off, sliding them over her butt and letting them fall. I thumbed at her bra hook and undid it watching the straps fall forward. She had reached back to pull my pajama pants down, struggling to get them around my erection.

I reached around her slipping my fingers between her legs and feeling her pussy. She was soaking wet and cried quietly, flinching as my fingers slid across her. Her ass moved against me and I leaned into her ear while my finger teased her. She had let the bra fall off and squirmed helplessly. ""I know you made me leave Maggie in my lap."" I said softly.

She didn't respond, gasping quietly. I ran a hand up her side and felt her breast, feeling it fit snuggly in my hand. She panted loudly, her pussy was dripping down my knuckle. ""You did, didn't you?""

She nodded hesitantly, ""I peeked during the kiss and saw her moving."" She said breathlessly. ""I wanted to watch."" She said before leaning back and kissing me, moaning in her throat as I slid a finger into her pussy. I fingered her slowly through the kiss and she had to break away to moan out loud. She moved away from me and pulled my hand leading me to the bed.

She climbed onto the bed and I rolled her onto her back, pulling her to the end. I got on my knees and opened her long legs wide. I kissed down her thigh slowly and she squirmed with soft breaths. My mouth made it to her pink, leaking pussy and tickled her folds with the tip of my tongue.

She cried quietly, covering her mouth as her whole body squirmed on the sheets. I held her moving hips running my tongue against her ceaselessly. My tongue played in the excessive wetness that ran from her pussy, licking it from her ass and folds.

She started to jerk, and her moans lost voice as orgasm started to race across her body. With no warning to me, her stomach clenched, and her legs curled up and she moaned loudly into her hand seizing for several seconds as she came.

She caught her breath and I watched as she recovered running a hand over her stomach and chest. She raked thick red hair from her face and sat up on her elbows. ""Holy crap..."" She panted. She sat all the way up and kissed me. Her soft toes felt my shaft while we kissed and she tugged wanting me on the bed.

""Take your shirt off,"" she breathed. I did tugging it over my head. As soon as it was in my hand she grabbed my neck and pulled on me.

""Fuck me... fuck me, please..."" She panted. I didn't need to be asked twice, I adjusted her on the bed, her legs up and around my torso, holding me with her knees, and her hands clasped behind my neck. I pushed my cock against her hip, she was so wet and slick I didn't have to adjust much to press into her pussy and start to slide in. She moaned desperately trying to keep her voice down.

I slid my cock in and out of her gripping pussy, watching her sweet face twist with intense pleasure, her petite breasts shaking with each thrust. I ran a hand up her stomach and grabbed a breast, being sure to squeeze her pink nipple firmly. She moaned into her hand before taking my wrist and pulling my hand to her neck.

I leaned slowly on her throat choking her gradually. My cock made loud wet sounds as it drove into her and I gripped her neck pushing into the mattress. Her face flushed turning pink and her moans were labored through being choked. I eased off her neck still pounding her insides and she held my hand to her face kissing my palm.

I slid my cock out and it slapped thick, glossy wetness across her stomach and leg as I did. Her face fought for breath while trying to pout. I tapped her hips and she rolled onto her stomach raising up on her knees. I slapped her ass with a loud pop and she whimpered approvingly before I hit her again. I pushed my cock back into her, having to push harder because of how tight this position made her.

She cried into the pillow forcefully, spreading her legs to accommodate me as I started fucking her again. She groaned through gritted teeth as I grabbed a fist full of thick hair at the scalp and yanked. ""Fuck yes, fuck me... ahh... "" I hammered her aggressively, balls slapping her stomach and she moaned into the sheets. I grabbed her hair again, yanking firmly. She squealed, heaving for breath, ""I'm cumming... I'm cumming...""

She shoulders shuddered and she moaned hard wailing into her palm as her pussy clamped down on my cock fluttering as climax ripped through her again. I slowed my pace as she came down, gulping for air, hand still over her mouth. She shook her head slowly, ""Not yet,""

She rocked back and forth stroking my cock with her pussy slowly. She watched my face with delight, as I put a hand on her ass and watched her slowly milk my cock. ""You can't handle a slow fuck."" She said quietly, still breathing.

She was so tight I could feel every inch of me being slowly squeezed, as she slid back and forth. I watched her body move, my cock disappearing under her ass. She spread her legs wider squeezing me more firmly as she stroked me deliberately. ""Come on, come on baby, give me what I want."" She said playfully.

She sped up slightly making quiet sounds as she took me into her tender, abused pussy. It wasn't long before I felt myself getting close. I didn't have to say anything, she knew and kept her pace steady, until I groaned loudly, unable to breathe as my cock exploded into her dumping thick burst after burst. She cooed with satisfaction and giggles until I fell out of her, cum leaking out quickly behind me.

She raised up on her knees and leaned back into me kissing me with her head turned. She ignored the strings of cum that fell out of her steadily as we kissed. ""I know you can't resist watching my ass."" She said quietly. I felt her wet cheek and she smiled.

""Do you want to clean up?"" I asked. She shook her head.

""I waited all day to be full of you."" She said giving me a kiss. ""If I hadn't gotten another load earlier tonight, I'd want seconds."" She said giggling.

""Well, don't be pessimistic, I can give you those seconds."" I said.

""Maybe in the morning,"" She said, ""It's been a long day.""

Bed didn't take long to follow, and true to her word, Liv, let my spunk leak into her panties all night.

I woke up slowly the next morning with morning-wood stabbing into the mattress. I rolled over carefully, hearing the shower start. Liv must have just gotten up. Suddenly the bedroom door opened and closed, and I tried to flatten my aching erection under the covers.

Maggie strolled into the room, her little body wrapped in a towel. She turned and looked at me and smiled. ""Good morning.""

""Hey,"" I said awkwardly, ""What are you doing here?""

""I wanted to borrow Liv's robe."" She said, walking toward me, and sat on the bed. She was so close, and I was still fighting my erection under the covers.

""I'm sure she won't mind."" I said uncomfortably.

""She never does, she shares everything with me."" She said quietly picking up a corner of the covers and pulling it back.

""Whoa, whoa, whoa!"" I said loudly trying to grab the covers. I pulled them back over me but that was a half solution. She giggled and bit her lip grabbing my hard shaft that poked up tenting the covers. She stroked me through the covers, eyes bright when she felt how hard it was.

""Don't worry,"" Maggie said with a smirk, stroking me softly through the blanket, ""It's like I said, we share everything."" My aching cock strained against her small hands and she leaned over kissing me softly. As her tongue felt mine between our lips, she pulled the covers back exposing me and running her soft fingers over my shaft. Her slight touch teased my agonizingly hard cock before taking it in her grip and stroking it.

She parted from the kiss and smiled at me, ""You're so hard, think I can make you cum before she gets out?""",,2025-08-15T19:00:27.036503,3752,

They were just sitting on the couch lounging, having a drink. Kate was wearing a skirt with a loose sweater... first thing I noticed is that I could see her nipples through it, so no bra. Though that's not unusual for her, especially around the house. The whole ensemble really accentuated her curves. Alena was just wearing some black jeans and a tank top, almost looking like someone from the cast of Grease.

I settled onto an arm chair, they got me a whiskey, and we made some small talk. It felt surprisingly normal. Kate broke the ice, and asked ""so, now that this is staring you in the face, are you still up for it? Feeling good?""

""I'm feeling very good,"" I replied, noting Alena's hand, which had been resting on Kate's thigh, started climbing until it was pushing her skirt up. ""Do you have any last minute things you want to talk about?""

Alena glanced at Kate before she answered. ""No, we're both feeling very good about our plan. I'm just a bit sad I'll have to turn in my gold start after tonight!""

""No you won't!"" I laughed, ""You're not having sex with me, remember? I'm using your body to masturbate.""

""What do you think, Kate?"" Alena teased, her hand pushing the hem of Kate's skirt to the point that I could see her entire leg. ""Do I get to keep my gold star?""

""Definitely, love."" Kate replied, and then leaned over to kiss her wife. Then kissed her again, harder. They started making out, and Kate swung her leg over Alena and started straddling her as they kissed. As she moved her skirt flounced up, and I could see the bottom of her ass - so either no underwear or a thong. I remembered what Kate said about liking to be watched, and sat back to enjoy, with my cock already getting pretty fucking full feeling. It's funny, I though the whole sister thing would either weird me out a bit or turn me on a lot from the taboo, but in that moment, she was just a sexy lady I got to watch making out with another lady.

Alena reached under Kate's sweater and started to pull it off, but Kate grabbed her by the wrist. ""Settle down,"" she purred, then glanced over to me. ""We're going to head upstairs now. Head up whenever you like, but give us a few minutes to get into it before you come in. We've left some supplies for you.""

I heard them walk up the stairs, and the door close. I decided to sneak up right away, trying not to make too much noise on the stairs. Fuck, am I a voyeur too? They have a little nook up just off from their bedroom door near the second floor landing, and they had put a towel over the chair there and had some lube sitting next to it. I didn't need another cue, and started stripping off, but didn't sit down in the chair. I crept to the door, listening. I heard moaning, and rustling. I couldn't tell who was who. I heard muffles voices, then a gasp, which I think was my sister.

Even though we made this more of an 'enjoy-the-sex' thing than a 'just stick it in' thing, we had agreed I'd get close before I came in. I'm uncircumcised and don't usually use lube when jacking off, my foreskin tends to be enough, so I left it there on the table, and listened at the door, and started stroking my shaft. As I've said, I think I'm about average sized. I've had partners compliment my girth, but I think that's just something people say to dudes.

At this point I hear what is unmistakably Kate's voice saying ""Oh fuck, god you feel good."" I start hearing some wet sounds as well. I start to have the build up, tingling feeling in my balls, not edging yet, but building. My mind is flying around with images, aided by the fact that I've seen them both naked before. I start imagining what it's going to feel like to push into Alena, and it's starting to get me closer. My mind also keeps going back to the lower part of Kate's ass under the skirt - somehow being partially covered was so much sexier than fully naked, and what she said about getting wet while we're at the beach together. I briefly allow myself to imagine her pussy wide and open for me too.

I decide I'm close enough. I knock. There's a pause while they change positions, and I hear Kate start moaning. I push the door open.

It was dim in the room, lit only by candles on their bedside dressed. The first thing I saw was Alena's ass in the air, her hips flexed, giving me full view. And full access. I see her face buried between two white, full, milky thighs, and I hear Kate moaning. I keep stroking as I walk in, and... man, it was so hard not to kneel down and start lapping at Alena's pussy. Her lips were so engorged, and wet, dripping wet. I've heard that phrase before, but never seen it, until now - her wetness had matted her bush a little bit, and I literally saw a drop of grool fall from her clit. I was in heaven.

As I approached, still stroking my cock, Kate came into view. Her hair was making a star around her head, here eyes were closed, her breasts are big enough that they kind of fall off to the side a tiny bit. She was grasping one nipple while her other hand was gripping Alena's short hair, pulling her face into her pussy.

This was it. I put a hand on the small of Alena's back ( just to let her know I was there, and she let her belly drop even more to pop her pussy out. I guided the tip in, and, fuck, I was in heaven. Her kegals were so strong... I'm not going to play into this ""tight lesbian who hasn't had dick"" trope, because I know she's had dildos much bigger than me, but I'm not sure I've ever felt that hot, wet, and enveloped in my first thrust. I went all the way to the hilt in one slow go, keeping my hand on the small of her back.

Without taking her head out from my sister's thighs, she let out a really deep moan. Kate was right, she really likes getting filled. Her pussy was so wet that when I pulled back my balls wanted to stick to her, which felt amazing. I started going at a steady pace. She stopped licking Kate, and put her head into the bed, forehead down. At this point I looked back up to Kate's face, and her eyes were open, looking at me. We made eye contact. She was still stroking her nipple, and scooched up a bit, so I could see her wet pussy. She started stroking her clit, still making eye contact with me. That's when it really hit me. I got to imagine, whatever else was true, that my sister was rubbing her clit for me. And that was so hot.

But I don't know what was wrong, I wasn't feeling that build up anymore. It felt really good, but there wasn't that pressure feeling building in my balls - I think my body got confused with the huge shift of sensation from stroking to fucking. I tried to slow down a bit, to get some more build up, but as soon as I did Alena started bucking on her own, pushing herself back onto me at a faster pace. I decided to just stand there, let her fuck onto me, close my eyes, and enjoy it.

I opened my eyes when I heard a rustle - Kate had moved, she was now laying 90 degrees from us, her face under Alena's face, and they were making out, with both of Kate's hands cupping Alena's cheeks. One hand then started to roam down Alena's body, cupping her breasts, then Kate shifted down a little bit, so she could rub Alena's clit. Now their bodies were kind of making a V still face to face, still whispering, kissing, it was so fucking hot.

Feeling Kate's finger pressed to Alena's clit as I was fucking her started that build up again. I could feel it - I was going to fill my sister-in-law up while my sister played with her. Kate's knees were bent and pretty near by, and I remembered what she said about having some human connection, and reached out and stroked her knee and her thigh a bit. Then I felt a change - this was the first time something had been done to me this entire time... Kate shifted her hand so her middle finger was against Alena's clit, but her ring and first fingers were down, so my balls stroked against them each thrust. As she rubbed Alena's clit... or maybe on purpose, just for me, she also started kneading a tiny bit.

This sent that buildup into overdrive, and I grabbed Alena's hips, and started controlling the pace completely. My fingers were digging into her, and I heard her say ""Oh fuck oh fuck"" into Kate's mouth. They stopped kissing, and Alena buried her face into Kate's neck, and Kate pulled her down with her free arm, her fingers still stroking us.

I was getting close, but not quite there yet, when Alena's thighs started to tremble. Then her whole body. I picked up my pace, and she was just panting and moaning, I could see the muscles on her back clench, her back arched, her legs clamped together, pussy clamped so tight on me. I stopped even trying to thrust into her, she was getting so hard to move even with how small she was, and just held her to me, balls deep, while Kate kept massaging her clit.

""Yellow"" she breathed, and we both paused. Kate's hand withdrew a bit from her clit, I took my hands off her hips but didn't pull out (since I assumed this was over-sensitivity and that can make it even worse) and we all just breathed for a sec.

""You okay?"" Kate asked.

""Yeah, that was just... a lot"" Alena panted.

""Should we call it for the night?"" Kate offered.

""No, I want to keep going, I just need a sec. Everyone just stay still,"" Alena breathed.

We just froze there... and I had a second to take in this situation. I glanced down and saw Kate's pussy as close as I had ever seen it, and dropped my hand down to rest on her thigh not too far from it. She spread slightly, and I saw some more. Made my dick twitch a bit.

""Woah,"" Alena gasped, clenched down on me again

""Sorry, kinda involuntary,"" I offered, ""and sorry I'm taking so long to finish""

""It's fine,"" Alena breathed ""I don't even think we've been doing this that long.""

Another breath. Alena relaxed. ""Okay, let's keep going,"" she said, slowly shifting her hips on me.

I slowly withdrew, then slowly pushed in again. Very gently, very slowly. At the end of maybe my third thrust, I pulled her back onto me, and I think per clit pressed against my balls again, because she like... exploded off of me, launched herself with her body

""Red!"" she panted, her legs clenched as she formed into a little ball.

""Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't,"" I was stammering, but she held out a finger, telling me to shut up for a second.

""No, no, no, you didn't do anything wrong."" she finally said, ""I'm just way too sensitive to keep going. Let's just take a real break?""

At that point we all agreed. I ran down to get some waters for all of us, my dick still rock hard and glistening in her juices, and when I came back up they were nestled under the bed under the covers.

Handing the waters over I checked if they were both good.

""Totally,"" Alena said ""that was fun, almost forgot about that whole thing"" she said, using a hand gesture to just wave over my whole gender.

""Hahah, glad to hear it,"" I replied, very aware that my cock had not had the decency to go down at all while I was downstairs. ""Do you want me to go? What's the plan from here?""

Kate suggested I sit in a little arm chair nestled beside their bed, and we could chat a bit and try again when we're all ready. We did. There was a lot of innuendo and jokes, some teasing that maybe Alena did need to give back her gold star, her calling us sickos.

We got chatting about fun sexy times we had had with other people, and it was nice. After a bit their hands started roaming back over each other. They had the covers on still so I couldn't quite see, but just settled back and got quiet. Kate was on top at this point, and I think her hand went back between Alena's legs.

""Woah nope, still too much."" Alena said

""Okay, well if you can't take some clit rubbing we're probably done for the night then?"" Kate suggested.

""No, I want to get that cum in me, we're doing this to find a way to."" Alen insisted. ""Let's trouble shoot. Plus, I'm sure the straight white guy will complain about how us evil mean lesbians gave him blue balls.""

""You have no idea the trials we face,"" I joked.

Alena suggested ""How about I play with you a little bit,"" to Kate, then looking at me ""And you can stroke yourself, and when you're close, like... really close, like about to bust close, push into me?""

""We can try that"" I said.

So I sat in the chair, as they made out. Stroking. As Alena rubbed Kate's clit. As Alena fingered her. I saw my little sister get fingered, in her pussy, in her ass, I saw her writhing, moaning. As I stroked. I heard Alena say ""you like getting fucked while your brother watches, don't you"" and saw Kate moan, and nod. Kate has told me she has small, easy orgasms, and I think she had at least two or three while they were doing this. I was getting really close, so I stood up to get closer. At this point Alena was kind of on her back like if she was in missionary position, and Kate was kneeling over her, her nipple in Alena's mouth, Alena's fingers fingering her pussy. I was standing there, still stroking, trying to wait till the last possible moment, when Alena pulled Kate's nipple from her mouth took her by the hair, and said ""you're going to watch as your little brother fucking breeds me.""

Kate spasmed and let out a gurgling moan, and BAM, that sent me barreling over the edge, with absolutely no warning. It came out of no where. I was just cumming, and cumming, still a few feet from Alena's pussy. Ropes got on her stomach, on Kate's side, in Alena's bush.

""Fuck, I'm sorry"" I finally said when I regained the power of speech.

We were all just looking at each other, them plastered in my cum, my dick covered in Alena's juices, and one of us started laughing. I think it was Alena, but Kate and I were right behind. I'm not sure what it was, but the situation was hilarious, and we couldn't stop. Alena got up a bit, grabbed my arm, and pulled me into bed laying on next to her. We all kept laughing, not really being able to control ourselves.

Once the laughter died down, Kate did probably the sexiest thing of the night. She scooped the cum off of her side, and off of Alena's stomach, then spread Alena's legs, and used her fingers to gently push it into Alena's pussy.

""I mean, that's the whole point, right? And who knows, we might get lucky."" She said with a smile.

Alena moaned as the fingers went in her, then grinded against Kate's hand for a bit, before pulling it back out, still somewhat covered in my cum.

""So, I guess I should go now?"" I asked.

Alena told me I could stay: ""I think when we suggested you'd leave the idea was we'd be getting back down to sexy stuff - I don't think I can handle more of that now. Why don't we just lie her, drink our water, watch some TV, then we can head to bed?"" Alena grasped my hand when inviting me to stay, which made me feel warm and comfortable inside.

I agreed enthusiastically. Strangely, it was about 10:30 - the whole thing including about 20-30 minutes of pre-game chatting had only taken an hour and a half or so. Kate was feeling chilly so got up and put on a white tank top, but me and Alena stayed nude (again, we've hung out nude before). When Kate got back into bed, she said she wanted to be in the middle, and dived in wedging herself between us. We were all under the covers, and she had her hand on my thigh, I had my hand on her thigh, and Alena had her head resting on Kate's chest. They've been re-watching Downton Abbey, so we watched a bit of that, and said goodnight.

It was honestly really nice that I got to stay afterwards, just felt warm and nice. I'll have to think about how I'd feel if all that happened then I got kicked out. We'll probably talk about that at a future date.

It's too bad I didn't finish in Alena that first night. I think all the build up, then the pauses, then the re-build up really played with my system. It happens.

As I got up to excuse myself to the guestroom, Alena said, ""Hey, sailor. Before you go. Maybe we try again tomorrow?""

""Aye-aye, captain,"" was all I could manage.",,2025-08-15T19:00:34.507749,3046,
https://www.literotica.com/s/queans-eat-cakes-kasey-and-rachel,Queans Eat Cakes - Kasey & Rachel,Unknown Author,,,,,"Rachel gagged as she struggled with the pace her husband's cock was hitting the back of her throat. Stuffed under the covers in her marital bed at 5:30 a.m. to tend to the raging hard cock wasn't her favorite way to start a morning. It was hot under those covers and she was starting to sweat.

She was sure millions of wives had been in this same predicament as their husbands held their heads using their mouth for pleasure. Sweat forming on the back of their neck as the relentless assault on their throat continued. Hoping it would be over soon. Slurping and sucking their hearts out trying to end the tiresome duty so they can come out from under the covers and enjoy a breath of cool air.

Rachel is fully aware that how she got in her current situation was altogether different from those millions of other wives. Because while she disliked this on some levels she craved it in all of the deep dark corners of her mind. Not so much the act of sucking cock, or being face fucked as she was currently, but the act of being controlled. She LOVES it. She NEEDS it. And since her Domme Kasey had given Rachel's husband ""free use"" privileges of her mouth she was obligated to give him pleasure with her mouth anytime he chose.

His grip tightened in her hair and she heard a soft husky moan. His body tensed and she was ""rewarded"" for her effort with a load of his salty essence. Thankful it was over she swallowed the gooey substance.

Rachel is in her early 30s with two young children and a husband she loves dearly. The ""perfect life"" according to most outside observers. Depression after her second child had been tough on her and as a result on her husband as well.

Derek is a great guy. Nice, honest, hardworking with a wonderful personality. Just a good wholesome American guy. He met Rachel right after college and things progressed to marriage 18 months later.

It has been just over three months since Rachel confessed to Derek that she loved him with all of her heart but she had needs that weren't being met. Derek was a good lover by vanilla standards but Rachel had darker needs. She craved being controlled and made to do things. Nasty, humiliating types of things.

To complicate things, as women's emotions normally do, she didn't want to let Derek try to control her. She didn't want to soil or tarnish him by exposing him to her embarrassingly kinky desires. Nor did she want to ruin their wonderful vanilla relationship and marriage. She felt if he learned too much about her kinky side he might see her in a different light. Or worse yet decide she wasn't a woman he wanted to be married to the rest of his life.

Rachel wanted to try and let Kasey, a friend of hers from college, take control. Kasey and Rachel had been unlikely friends as Kasey was a hot blonde sorority girl while Rachel was a more shy and private person not wanting the busy sorority girl lifestyle.

Derek knew very little about Kasey. She had come to their wedding. He met her briefly and did admit she was a beautiful blonde bombshell. He knew that Kasey put in a good word for Rachel when she applied for her current job several years back. Apparently Kasey knew Rachel's boss in some capacity. And he knew Rachel had lunch with Kasey a few times over the last year.

Rachel explained that Kasey was the trophy wife of a man in his 50s which had led to her becoming a bored housewife. She admitted that she and Kasey had been intimate a couple of times in college with Kasey always taking control of Rachel.

""It was no big deal. We were drunk college girls exploring. She always had a boyfriend and I dated guys too. But when she got tired of the sorority social life she would come get me and we would get drunk. After which she normally took control of me and we fooled around. Harmless fun. And until now, neither of us has ever told anyone about it.""

After several days of soul searching conversations Derek agreed to meet Kasey for lunch. Just the two of them so he could ask her questions to help calm any of his fears. The lunch went well. Probably because Kasey was so hot that Derek didn't stand a chance of saying no. They agreed to some ground rules and exchanged numbers so they could text about anything going on with Rachel that the other person should know about.

A couple of key issues that neither Rachel nor Derek realized put Kasey in complete control. You see Derek still didn't know much about his wife's dark desires. She was too embarrassed to share so he didn't push for details or examples. He just wanted his wife to be happy.

And Rachel didn't know the ground rules that Kasey and Derek agreed upon. She was just so happy to be embarking on finding herself again. She had felt like she lost herself after having kids and wanted to get back to at least having one thing for just herself.

Rachel knew Kasey would push her limits but part of her craved that reality. Giving herself over to Kasey's whims was a huge turn on. Tons of kinky things lurked in her mind. But she wanted to be ""forced"" to do them. Exhibitionism, being used as a sex toy, humiliation. Even becoming a complete slave to Kasey fueled some of her orgasms during masturbation. But could she really do the things that drove her to orgasms while masturbating?

Kasey's husband Thomas travelled for business frequently allowing Kasey the freedom to find time to see Rachel. Kasey started things slow with Rachel to keep everyone involved at ease.

The first meeting Kasey got Rachel alone was one evening after work when Thomas was out of town on business. This meant Derek was home taking care of the children.

The two women shared a bottle of wine allowing Kasey time to remind Rachel that her current boss, David, had dated Kasey in college. And Kasey still thought he was hot. Rachel explained he was going through a divorce and seemed ""high strung"" some days.

""Interesting."" Kasey thought aloud, ""Perhaps I should take control of your clothes quicker than I was planning. I'm sure David would enjoy some eye candy around the office."" she giggled.

""Kasey! He is my direct boss. That is dangerous for me."" Rachel replied.

""Oh nonsense. You loved it in college when guys ogled you and made crude comments about that ass or your nipples pointing at them.""

""I did. I admit it. But my boss? That's just....""

""Enough."" Kasey interrupted Rachel.

""This isn't a debate. You NEED me and you will do well to remember that. Now crawl over here and eat my pussy like my college slut years ago.""

Rachel's pussy dampened as she watched Kasey recline on the couch. Spreading her tan legs to reveal she wasn't wearing any panties under her sundress. The 10 years since college evaporated as Rachel's face approached the wet pussy in front of her.

It was obvious that Kasey got waxed on a regular basis as her skin was so soft and smooth against Rachel's lips as she kissed her way down from the belly button. Rachel also noticed that Kasey must sun naked as there were no tan lines on her journey down to the moist treasure.

""Ahhhhh, now THIS is something I can get used to."" Kasey sighed enjoying the pleasure Rachel's tongue was providing her.

""You have to trust me Rach. With the generous ground rules your hubby agreed to we are going to stoke your inner demons like you have only dreamed of. And I know David well enough to not jeopardize your job.""

Rachel spent the next 45 minutes becoming reacquainted with Kasey's sweet pussy. It always baffled her how Kasey always tasted fresh and sweet. Like she had just come out of the shower. Even after the two of them partied all night in college when Rachel ate her pussy it tasted so fresh and sweet.

Kasey enjoyed two orgasms over the 45 minutes that Rachel worshipped her. Thoughts of the fun she would have putting Rachel through her paces rolled through her mind.

""When you get home give Derek a blowjob. As a ""thank you"" for keeping the kids tonight. I will text him and let him know you will be giving him a BJ tonight as a thank you for him. This will serve two purposes. One is he won't quiz you about what we did. The second is it will keep you from having an orgasm. As I told you earlier orgasm control or denial will be a huge part of my control over you. NO Orgasms without MY permission! PERIOD."" Kasey commanded as they walked to the door.

Derek quickly became accustomed to the ""thank you"" blow jobs his wife gave him every time she came home from seeing Kasey. He also noticed a few new blouses that were tighter than her older blouses. The buttons between her 38 C cups were pulled tight clearly showing her ample chest to the world.

He knew Kasey was going to control his wife's attire so he didn't say anything. He figured she was just provoking male attention to give some mild humiliation to his wife. Make her blush if she got cat calls from guys on the street.

What he didn't know about was the several new miniskirts his wife was hiding to keep him from getting upset with Kasey. The ingenious plan was for Rachel to wear a new miniskirt under her old longer skirts. Then she could put the old skirt in the trunk of her car when she swapped her flat shoes for one of her pair of 3 inch heels.

Kasey had bought Rachel 4 pairs of 3 inch heels to be worn at work. There was a black pair along with white, red and tan. She was now forced to wear 3 inch heels when she wasn't at home.

Rachel would never forget the first day of her new work dress code. Kasey had her wear a black miniskirt that was about halfway down her thigh. Usually her skirts touched the top of her knee so showing several inches of her thighs made her nervous. But also excited her exhibitionist side. And not being allowed stockings made it even hotter for her. Showing the world the flesh of her thighs added to the nervous adrenaline.

A simple white blouse and her new black heels completed her outer ensemble. Kasey didn't give any instructions on undergarments except a universal one of only wearing thongs going forward. ""Your choices are a thong or nothing at all."" Kasey had chirped with a smirk.

Rachel's mind was becoming more comfortable with being sexy again. Not just a mother of two but also a person. A sexual being and it was ok to feel good about herself if men found her attractive.

On this Friday she was feeling naughty and decided to wear a matching set with a white lace bra and thong. She had never worn the white lace bra out of the house before today because her large sensitive nipples would show through the lace causing her to be embarrassed.

She figured it would give the guys at work a jolt seeing her in heels, short skirt and tight blouse with her nipples more than likely showing. Hopefully just the right amount of embarrassing to excite her. But more importantly she was having lunch with Kasey and wanted to please her by playing along with the ""give David something to look at"" campaign. It had been weeks since her last orgasm and she hoped to please Kasey enough to earn an orgasm.

Rachel worked in a small satellite office for a large company. The office was mostly men. But the guys were nice and rarely bothered her with sexual banter although she knew a couple of them wanted her. She could never get a read on her boss. David was reserved and normally too busy to pay much attention to Rachel.

Midmorning Rachel got a text from Kasey, ""Feeling slutty? Legs and tits all exposed for the guys to stare and lust over?""

""Yes Kasey. Very slutty and exposed.""

""Good. That's how I want My slut to feel. Now take a walk around the office. Make sure to walk by David's office. Let me know if he takes a look.""

Rachel's stomach churned as she thought about the impending trip around the office. Being called, ""My slut"" along with the command to ""take a walk"", showing Kasey's clear control over her, did have her feeling erotic and naughty.

Heading to the bathroom would mean walking past David's office twice. She made eye contact with David as she passed his door. Luckily he was on his phone so there was no need to speak to him. Around the corner she passed one of the guys from the warehouse who stared at her boobs without evening trying to hide that he was looking.

Her already erect nipples grew harder as he whispered, ""Wow"" as they passed in the narrow hallway. Once in the bathroom her breathing was heavy from the excitement. Feeling very submissive and wanting to share her feeling with Kasey she snapped a selfie in the mirror to show how erect and visible her nipples were.

""OMG! Only a slut would get turned on prancing around her office letting the men see her goodies. Now edge your pussy before you return to work. I will see you at lunch.""

The command was welcomed if Rachel were honest with herself. She wanted to touch herself and being told to do so in a bathroom stall at work made it even hotter.

She stepped into a stall and immediately slipped a hand under her miniskirt. ""One advantage to wearing a miniskirt"" she thought as she slipped her thong to the side allowing her fingers to glide over her clit. Sexual electricity shot through her body as her fingers worked their magic. Moments later the pleasure gave way to frustration as she was forced to stop short of an orgasm.

Her hot thoughts turned on a dime as well, ""Serves you right. Giving control of your sex life to another person. You deserve to be denied and punished.""

The walk back past Daivd's office was uneventful as the door was closed. Probably because the warehouse guy was in there for a meeting.

When Rachel arrived at lunch she found Kasey in the back of the restaurant which she assumed was on purpose when she noticed Kasey giggling as she got to the table. ""Wow, I think everyone in here watched those babies bounce back here. I mean who could miss them with those torpedoes poking through that blouse."" she taunted in a whispered tone.

""I can't help it. This lace bra allows them to move and my nipples are so sensitive they get like granite if I walk any distance.""

""Really? Very nice info indeed. Order 6 more bras just like that one. Multiple colors. Text me a screen shot of the order before you go to bed tonight. I will pay for them and you will wear them."" her last sentence made her chuckle.

""Ugh, Kas......"" Rachel quickly swallowed her thought. Knowing it was better to agree than to complain. Especially if she wanted an orgasm anytime soon. ""Yes Kasey. I appreciate you buying them for me."" she finished with a polite smile and opened her menu.

""Smart girl. Let me be clear. Going forward if you complain too much about my ideas I may choose to show you how things can always be worse. In this case, for instance, I could make Friday a no bra day for you. Those C cups bouncing around with no support would be a sight to behold. Wouldn't you agree?""

Rachel shuddered at the thought of going anywhere in public without a bra and especially didn't like the idea of going to work without one.

""Yes Kasey. I will try to be more appreciative of your ideas for me.""

""That's the spirit."" Kasey beamed as the waitress showed up to get their order.

As they ate Kasey asked, ""So what made you wear that lace bra today?""

""To be honest it was several things. The most important was to please you and show I am your submissive and if you want me to give David something to look at then I will do my best.""

""It has been awhile since your last orgasm, hasn't it?"" Kasey smirked.

Rachel stared down into her salad. ""Yes Kasey.""

""And you were hoping by taking initiative that I might allow you to enjoy the pleasure of an orgasm?""

""Y....ye.. yes Kasey. Pl...please. Th...this is all so new and while Derek most certainly enjoys the ""Thank you"" blow jobs I think he may be starting to miss... you know... intercourse."" Rachel whispered.

""Oh sweetheart."" Kasey mocked with a sarcastic tone of concern. ""You should give your man what he wants. If you can't do it without an orgasm then you have two choices. Be punished for having an unauthorized orgasm. OR be a slut and give him anal. Hell, he may love you even more if you start taking it up the ass."" she chuckled enjoying Rachel's predicament.

""I...I ...was... jus... just hoping you would let Derek and I have a somewhat normal sex life.""

""I'll tell you what. I will allow you to have as many orgasms as you want tonight with Derek. After you blow him and swallow his load for the ""thank you"" bj since we are having lunch together. I mean a horny wife like you should be able to get her husband up for a second round, right?"" Kasey giggled.

""Yes Kasey. Thank you!"" Rachel gushed.

""Wait a minute. You haven't heard the catch. I need you to do something to earn this privilege I am giving you.""

""Oh god"" Rachel thought as her stomach churned.

""You need to know I fucked David last night. And again this morning if the truth be told.

It's probably why he didn't notice your outfit today being so worn out.

But he was really interested in me having a female submissive to control and use to my heart's content.""

Rachel's inhale of breath was audible. ""YOU DIDN'T""

""Relax. I haven't told him who my female sub is yet. He is such a cool guy. He's so non judgmental about sex. Like whatever gets me off is cool with him. And his cock is a NICE size. It's thick. So thick I want to watch you gag on it.""

Rachel's head was spinning. Her mind raced.... ""This is crazy. Just like carefree Kasey to not be concerned with the consequences of making me do shit like this. I'm married and she wants to watch me gag on my boss' cock. Wait, did Derek agree to her making me service other guys? Would Derek be into that? Having a wife that is a slut? Maybe that makes me a better slut for him. Or makes him feel ok treating me like a slut during sex.""

Kasey's voice snapped Rachel out of her spiraling thoughts. ""So my plan is simple. You will go in his office and he can facetime me so I can watch.""

""You can't be serious."" Rachel replied in shock while noticing the moistness between her legs. Her kinky denied pussy was pulsing at the same rate her head was pounding.

""Think about it. Doing it in his office means he has more to lose than you do. He is your boss so they would fire him in a heartbeat. And me watching on facetime means no video of it for either of you two to worry about.""

Rachel sat quietly trying to control her emotions. Especially those damn kinky ones urging her to be the submissive slut she craved to be.

Kasey continued her explanation, ""It's harmless bdsm fun. It's a slave being told to service a guy. Who the guy is doesn't matter and who the slave is doesn't matter. So it's not like cheating on your spouse. It's performing a sex act for the entertainment of your Mistress.""

Kasey stood up to leave and leaned over to whisper in Rachel's ear, ""I fucked him after he came out of the shower this morning so text me afterwards and let me know if you can taste my juices on him.""

Then she stood tall and patted Rachel's shoulder as she walked off saying, ""Don't be late getting back to work.""

Shortly after Rachel got back to work David stopped in her doorway. ""I have a report from corporate that I have a few questions about. Can you come to my office at 2:30 to go over it with me?""

""Sure. No problem."" Rachel replied in a professional tone hoping she didn't sound nervous.

Moments later a text popped up on Rachel's phone. ""I hear my facetime entertainment is set for 2:30. Go to the bathroom and edge now. Send me a pic of your wet pussy when you finish.""

""Yes Kasey"" was the quick reply as Rachel got up to obey.

As Rachel passed David's office he gave her a big grin and she suddenly felt how hard her nipples were as they rubbed the lace confining them. Once in the stall the edging didn't take long. Rachel was mortified at how wet her pussy looked in the picture she sent. The two fingers holding her folds apart were soaked in her juices.",,2025-08-15T19:01:08.446178,3651,
https://www.literotica.com/s/kicked-out-with-my-daughter-ch-04,Kicked Out with My Daughter Ch. 04,Unknown Author,,,,,"Waking up next to my daughter the first morning back home, was more subdued than our time in the hotel room. She awoke first, and stared at me as I slept. When I finally opened my eyes, a bit confused at first, she showered me with kisses. Some daughterly, and others the kind most fathers never get to share with their daughters. I was aroused waking up to her warm mouth on mine, and she noticed, wrapping her hand around my cock to give it a squeeze, but neither of us were ready for sex at that moment. We were both sleepy, and were happy to just lay there under the covers, basking in each others body heat. Now that I was awake she pushed in closer to me, my dick slid between her legs and rubbed against her pussy making me moan. Smiling she reached down again and adjusted herself, so that my cock slid inside her tight cunt. I moaned louder as I pushed into her depths, and she pushed against my body wrapping her arms around me. We stayed like that not moving, only sleeping. Although, she did milk my cock while we lay there in a doze, her pussy muscles contracting around my still dick, doing it without thought. My cock fit perfectly in her and sleeping this way felt natural, as if we were meant to merge in this way even in sleep. We both slept lightly, not dreaming, while her pussy milked cum from my cock.

When we both were more awake we started to talk, discussing the past few days, and different things we wanted to try, like her wanting to try anal, something I enthusiastically agreed with. She also wanted to show me all her sex toys, some of which I already saw.

""You know Dwaddy, this morning, waking up with you like this, it's like a dream come true,"" she said.

""I feel the same, Amanda. I love you baby girl,"" I replied with a kiss.

""No, I didn't say it right, I mean I always wanted something like this to happen,"" she said.

""What do you mean?"" I asked.

""Well Dwaddy, I hope this doesn't change anything but, I haven't been entirely honest with you,"" she then proceeded to confess things better than I could have imagined. ""I'm a virgin Dwaddy, I know I've dated a lot of boys but that was just to keep mom happy, I've never even kissed a boy, you were my first kiss Dwaddy. Since I first learnt what sex was I wanted to do it with you. I would stay up late many nights touching myself, and playing with toys, thinking about one day teasing you so much that you lose control and wape me Dwaddy. I also lied about the birth control, I've never taken it, as I hoped that if you ever did rwape me like in my dreams, I would get to carry our incest baby. I only told you mom took me off birth control because you were mad at her and I thought that would make you cum in me. I've wanted you to wape me for so long. I may have been trying to turn you on that night mom kicked you out, I thought maybe it was finally my chance."" She was blushing and hiding her face even though there was no way I could possibly be mad about this, her confession made me feel pure joy, and my head spun with the realization of what she was saying. ""The only reason I know how to do things like blowjobs, and how to have mind blowing sex, is because I tried to find out everything a guy might like, watching porn, and reading Internet posts about what feels good. That's why I have so many sex toys, so I could practise for you Dwaddy, because you're the only man I want, and I wasn't going to practise with a stupid boy who would break my heart, or worse, fill my belly with a dirty, non incest, non rape, baby.""

I moved her hands from her face to find tears streaming down her face, she was worried I would regret everything we did and want to stop, but instead of being angry I was happy. I kissed her tears away. ""Oh Babygirl I could never be mad at you, in fact hearing all that just makes me so happy that you're my daughter. Now that I've had you, I know no one else could compare, and I promise to rape you all you want. Normally I couldn't care less if someone is or isn't a virgin, but because you're my daughter and I'm your father, and I got to take your virginity, well it makes it all much hotter and special,"" I said as I made my dick throb inside her causing her to giggle and smile.

""Thank you Dwaddy, I was worried about telling you the truth, but I can't lie to you. I hope you wape me lots!"" She replied. Then she pushed me onto my back, causing me to pull out of her. She proceeded to climb onto my lap, slowly sitting on my dick, pushing it into her tight, velvety, wet pussy. Her juices gushed down my dick and balls, as she slowly moved up and down, grinding against me.

""I'll rape you whenever you want,"" I said, she moaned in response. Downstairs the phone rang, it was picked up by my wife.

""I've been thinking Dwaddy, we should talk more about what we'll do with Mommy, I have a few ideas of things we could do,"" my Daughter said while she squeezed my dick, not the best time to make plans when I had her slowly milking me, thankfully I had enough ideas I could make suggestions without thinking much.

""What're your ideas?"" I moaned out, encouraging my daughter to do the talking, so I could focus on relaxing as my cock leaked out cum into her.

She giggled then said, ""well the first thing I was thinking is we should give her a new name. Something to hurt her, I'd been thinking of calling her piggy. I know she's attractive and thin, but I still think the name is perfect for her.""

""To be honest I know most would consider her attractive, but I've got no attraction to her, you have the body type I've always preferred babygirl. She could never come close to you.""

""Really Dwaddy? I mean I know you like me already,"" she gave my dick a squeeze with her pussy as she said this causing me to squirt cum, ""and I know she's got a flat ass which no one likes, but she has big tits, and is thin. I have a bit of a chubby stomach, my thighs touch, and I got cellulite on my ass.""

""Oh honey,"" I moaned, ""you're perfect, I never married your mother for her looks, and she doesn't come close to you. Out of ten you're an eleven. You have curves that men would die for, your thighs drive me crazy, I love that they touch, and I've enjoyed imagining my face between them. Yes you have a tummy and I love it, in fact I wanna make it bigger,"" she giggled, and her pussy got tighter. ""You do cheerleading, and you're so fit because of it, your body is the way it is because of nature, you got a little chub, but you also have a lot of muscles. It's perfect, and yes you have cellulite but that's because your ass is so perfect, plump, and round that it's to die for. Also I never liked your mom's tits, I prefer yours,"" I reached up and squeezed them. ""They're perfect, not tiny but not big. A perfect handful that I can hold, perky, soft, and warm. I always preferred tits like yours. I only like skinny girls when they are that way because of nature, but I still prefer girls like you and I don't want you to ever think I don't find you perfect, imperfections included,"" I smacked her ass causing her to moan.

""Oh Dwaddy you know the perfect things to say. I wuve you!"" She leaned down to give me a kiss, starting to bounce up and down on my dick a little faster, her ass smacking against my legs.

""I love you too princess."" It was at that moment we were interrupted by my wife walking in.

""Um honey?"" She asked. She was still naked which was good, it showed she was still submissive to us.

My daughter turned to her, staring daggers at her, and causing my wife to shrink back. My daughter started to fuck me harder, trying to send a message of who owned my dick now.

""What do you want?"" Amanda said.

""I'm sorry, the school called, I have the headmistress on the phone.""

Amanda rolled her eyes, ""Fine give it to Daddy."" She picked up the pace.

""Are you sure?"" Sarah asked.

""Yes I'm sure. Don't fucking question me pig,"" my daughter said annoyed.

My wife walked up and handed me the phone, then turned to walk away.

""Where are you going piggy?"" My daughter asked. ""You weren't dismissed.

""Oh!"" My wife said, clearly unsure what to do.

""That means kneel and shut your mouth pig,"" my daughter replied. ""No forget that, I change my mind, come here and lick my ass and Dwaddy's balls while he's on the phone.""

I lifted my phone to my ear as I watched my wife tentatively approach my daughters rear while Amanda rode my dick, milking it of cum. Annoyed at her slowness Amanda grabbed piggies head and shoved her face into Amanda's ass. ""Don't be a pussy, my ass isn't gonna kill you."" She moaned. ""Yeah that's it. Now don't just lick it, stick that tongue in there. Get it in my ass, tongue fuck me, Oh just like that, good piggy.""

""Hello?"" I said into the phone hoping the Headmistress of Amanda's school couldn't hear what was going on.

""Ah Mike, it's good to hear from you."" She said, her breathing seemed lustful, though I may have been misreading it thanks to being in the middle of having sex with my daughter.

As I mentioned before, Amanda went to a coed private school, which had an all female teaching staff, as well as the teaching staff the administrators and other staff where also all female, the only males being students. Now with the clarity that came from my wife's outburst, and from fucking my daughter, I had some suspicions about some of the teaching staff as well as the principal who was referred to as the headmistress. Despite the supposed religious history of the institution, and the connection to the church, I suspected there was a lot of perversion among the staff. Recent comments from my daughter, as well as past memories of events that I now saw in a different light, made me suspect some things. I don't think anyone that isn't directly involved in working there is a part of anything perverse. For the rest of the church and community everything that happens is all above board, while the truth might be very dirty.

I realize now that when I still felt attraction for my wife I was blinded to things that would have been obvious to others. There's a lot that could be mistaken for something dirty when the true context is innocent, but I know for sure that two things I had viewed innocently were actually much more perverse on reflection. The first is the headmistress herself. I don't know for certain what the headmaster wore normally, maybe it was a coincidence that every time she had a meeting with me she wore clothes that were not conservative in the slightest, and that anytime I saw her outside of a planned meeting she wore more conservative clothing with her more sexual charged clothing also being a common outfit choice, but I suspect she only wore clothes that would raise eyebrows around me and my daughter specifically. I highly doubted she was wearing sexually clothing normally, since every unplanned interaction with her had her wearing conservative clothing. I'll give an example to you of what she wore one time when I met with her during Amanda's second year. It was a white dress shirt, a few sizes too small so that it was skin tight, her breasts pushed out the top and stretched the fabric enough that there was space between the buttons where you could see skin. She would never wear a bra during our meetings, so I could always see her nipples through white shirts, and she was black so that meant that I could see more through the shirt than if a white person wore it. She wore a mini skirt that was the same kind of plaid number that the students wore, and it looked like it was meant for one of the younger tiny students as when her back was turned to us I could see a hint of her ass cheeks. A few times she's worn it without underwear and I would know she wasn't wearing underwear because when she did wear it I was able to see what little there was, as she preferred thongs, and boy shorts. Of course I'm not complaining, I have a feeling both of us are of the same mind, less fabric there is for underwear, the better, on women anyways, men need more support. She loved thigh high tights, and loved knee high heels. The second thing she did, was, on multiple occasions, I felt her foot rub against my leg, travelling up almost to my crotch. Of course my ignorant ass didn't see what she was trying to do, assuming it was an accident, and then not understanding after the meetings why my wife would be so cranky. I didn't see that the principle had been trying to seduce me, though my wife sure did.

A final thing that I have suspicions about—it's not directly connected to the last two things—is the fact that it's not only a high school. Students are encouraged to stay an extra year when they are 18 and are done with high school. The idea being that it's an extra year available to help students prepare for secondary education. It's meant to be a buffer between high school and University or College in an attempt to help students get ahead in life, and it's free for any students who went to the private school, their parents not having to pay like they did during the high school years. Lately I've noticed that there has only ever been eighteen year old girls that go through the program, boys have never gone through the extra year, and despite it being sold as one extra year a few of the girls stay for two or three. This in itself doesn't make me question it, but what does is the fact is that if you actually ask the parents about the program you never get the same answer, and even get contradicting stories. If a parent wants to pick up their offspring they have to wait at the office, where previous years they can go to the classroom, it seems that staff will do whatever they can to keep the parent from actually going to the extra year classes. I only came to this realization during the recent week I've had with my daughter. So there is always a chance that I could be misreading things I'm remembering from before my eyes were opened by my daughter. So I can't confirm any of my suspicions until I have an excuse to be at Amanda's school, and even then, she's not in the program as she's still finishing her final normal year.

""We've been so worried about Amanda when she didn't come into school earlier this week. We understand, though, that thinking to call slipped your mind, your wife told me that you were working through some family issues right now,"" she said in the breathy voice. I hadn't cared to tell anyone where I was with my daughter, I wanted to leave that to my wife as another way to leave her to sit in worry.

""Well you don't have to worry any loooonger ohhhh fuck."" I bit my tongue to stop moaning. At the same moment Amanda slowed down the pace, starting to slowly grind on me again, teasing me, while my wife choose that moment to lick my balls making me have an orgasm and squirt a huge load into my daughter. At the time I didn't think anything about it but Sarah seemed to be enjoying this more than one would expect from her. ""Tell your mom not to go there until I'm off the phone,"" I whisper shouted at my daughter. My dick was still hard, despite my orgasm. My daughter's tightness didn't let me go soft easily.

""Are you okay Mike? You sound—distracted."" Amanda's Principle said.

""Shit,"" I thought to myself. ""Yes I'm fine. Sorry about that."" My heart was in my throat, I wondered how much she heard. I put the phone on speaker so Amanda and Sarah could hear, partly so my daughter knew not to push it, and in the hope something might be said that would get to my wife. I was a little worried though that my daughter could be heard, her breathing was heavy and she was shaking occasionally, having mini orgasms, as she milked me.

""Well I just wanted to follow up and make sure everything is okay. Your wife was—well she was hysterical when I talked to her a few days ago, and she was kind of vague before passing you the phone."" Melissa said.

""Well you don't have to worry about holding back or censoring yourself,"" I said. ""I'm sure hysterical is too kind for her at the time. She's always been a bit of,"" I searched for words wondering how far I should take it. If my suspicions were right I would get away with it, but if I was completely off base I could cause trouble.

""Fuck it, maybe I'm not in the best headspace for making decisions with my daughter's tight cunt squeezing my cock, but even without that I don't think I could give a shit at this point, in for a penny in for a pound, maybe I'll get to fuck another hot woman that I know,,"" I thought. ""Sorry, she's always been a bit of a cunt. It just got to be to much. Amanda and me both needed a break from her."" I could hear my wife had paused, probably angry, but my daughter smacked Sarah to get her to keep going, hopefully Melissa didn't hear her getting hit, or at least didn't think anything about it.

""Mike! You naughty boy!"" Melissa said, the flirtation clear in her voice. She enjoyed what I had said. ""Normally I only punish students, but it seems like you need some punishing with that mouth of yours."" I could hear the smile in her voice and I smiled back, even if she couldn`t see it.

""Well I've recently had a new outlook on life. I don't mean to upset you, I just needed to get it off my chest,"" I replied. ""Headmistress,"" I added as an afterthought, might as well fully play up the chastised school boy for her.

""Well Mike this new outlook of yours is—interesting."" Her pause said so much. I was sure she was flirting now, and the pause suggested she wanted to say so much more than just interesting. She was playing it safe, perhaps unsure if we were on the same wavelength, unsure if I was on her sexual level, or if I was still my naive self not seeing obvious signals, my words only seeming sexual; a part of me thought maybe she wasn't alone, and couldn't say what she wanted to. I was having a hard time thinking with my cockpocket of a daughter on my dick, trying to be eloquent at the time was like trying to perform brain surgery with a chainsaw.

My daughter saw the struggle in my face and leaned over me, griding on me in a circular motion. ""Keep going Daddy. She wants you, and I would love to play with Miss Kuntz,"" she whispered in my ear, of course pronouncing it cuntz instead of the proper way. Then proceeded to bite and suck on my neck which didn't help much, but it was the encouragement I needed to be brave and not second guess myself. Of course my wife could make out my daughters words, and I just prayed that if the headmistress could hear Amanda she liked what my daughter was saying.

""Well Miss,"" I said putting on my best naughty school boy voice, ""I just wanted to be honest. See Amanda and I had to leave for a few days, we didn't get the chance to pack either, because of a misunderstanding. Amanda didn't have to come with me, but she had come home just as I was walking to my car, and well, she's always been a daddies girl.""

""I can imagine that,"" Melissa said, a hint of sexual suggestion in her voice made me wonder, but I couldn't ponder on it at the time.

""Anyways she didn't go inside, and as she is a legal adult I didn't argue with her. See me and Sarah had a fight because she had wrongly accused me of cheating.""

""Oh you poor thing,"" Melissa replied with a pout in her voice.

""So we stayed at a hotel outside the city in order to give me wife time to get herself together,"" I had to bite back a gasp as I felt my skin break from my daughters teeth, and she went crazy once the blood welled up in her mouth, speeding up her pace on my cock. The blood from my neck, and my pulsing cock, was encouraging her to go fast. ""And I uh, well, thought it was best for Amanda to not go to school for the week, because we had to go so far out of the city due to us living in a popular town for college kids to come to during their spring break. So we took some time to relax, and wait for things to settle down. We got back yesterday, but we are still, uh, adjusting to the new situation.""

""New situation? I'm curious now. If you want someone to talk to about what happened sweetie I'm hear to listen,"" she said, sex flowed heavy in every syllable.",,2025-08-15T19:01:14.419887,3801,

Katie and Annie watched poolside as Ethan leapt expertly from the diving board, disappearing under the water with a pleasingly hushed splash.

""He's getting really good at that,"" Annie said, thumbs idly stroking her pregnant belly.

Annie wore a pink maternity swimsuit, her brown hair cascading from a sun hat to curl gently around her shoulders.

They had been relaxing beside one another in lounge chairs for most of the hot afternoon, taking refuge from the sun beneath a large deck umbrella.

Katie was relieved she and Ethan managed to get their pool ready in time for the summer. They definitely needed a break from work stress, and Annie especially needed a place to unwind.

""Oh, yeah,"" Katie said, sipping her iced tea. ""Babe's been practicing. He's gotten even more in shape, if you can believe that.""

Annie sighed longingly.

""I believe it.""

Even though Annie wore sunglasses, Katie could tell she had been staring at her husband since Ethan came out in his trunks. She couldn't blame her. Ethan already had a fairly toned body for years, but this year he had gone on a diet and began exercising daily. The results were hard to miss.

""How's everything?"" Katie asked, stirring her drink with the straw. The question had been on her mind all day.

""Oh, good,"" Annie said, still stroking her bump. ""Real good. Baby's doing great.""

""I meant with you,"" Katie replied gently, placing a hand on Annie's arm.

Annie went quiet. Maybe Katie shouldn't have said anything.

Annie took a deep breath.

""Jake's gone for sure,"" she said, holding back a sob. ""But that's a good thing. We don't need him, do we?"" she caressed her stomach.

Katie smiled sadly.

""That's right, Annie. You don't need that loser.""

After a beat of silence, Katie added, ""you can always stay with us anytime. You must get lonely in that big house.""

""Yeah, sometimes,"" Annie nodded. ""At least we got the house, though. It'll be a great place for my baby.""

""I do think you should come stay with us when the due date arrives. Just in case. Or maybe we can come bunk with you, if you like? It won't be long now.""

Annie smiled, thanking her.

Ethan finished his lap around the pool and ascended the cement steps, dripping and smiling as he strode toward them.

Katie noticed Annie tense as Ethan approached.

""How's everything?"" Ethan asked, wiping water from his face. His abs glistened in the sunlight, the water trickling between the muscles to disappear into his trunks.

With his trunks soaked and hugging his body, Annie undoubtedly got a good idea of what Ethan was packing down there.

Annie blushed. Behind her sunglasses, it would be really easy to get a good look at Ethan's bulge without him noticing.

""It's perfect!"" she said. ""Thank you for inviting me.""

""You can come over any time,"" Ethan said. ""Can I get you anything?""

They had all known each other for several years, Katie and Annie being college dorm mates. They met Ethan in some elective in their sophomore year. The rest was history. It wasn't long after graduation they got married, and not longer after that when Annie married Jake.

Katie didn't like to think about Jake. She was just proud that Annie found the courage to divorce him. Now she could raise the baby without any drama.

""Oh, no,"" Annie said. ""I'm fine.""

""Why don't you take a quick dip with me?"" Ethan offered his hand.

Annie turned even redder.

""In a bit maybe. I think I have to pee again soon!"" she laughed.

Ethan shrugged, still giving Annie the genuine smile of his that Katie loved so much.

""Just let me know, I'll help you in.""

He turned his attention to Katie, looked her up and down in her black bikini.

""Lookin' good, beautiful."" He winked before returning to the water.

Annie sighed again, watching Ethan go. Katie couldn't help but smirk.

""Take a picture, hun,"" she teased.

Annie shook her head.

""What?"" she asked dreamily.

""Annie, you've been ogling my husband like a starved lion stalking a wildebeest.""

Annie looked away, rubbing her knees together and fidgeting her shoulders.

""No, I wasn't--"" she looked at Katie, who smiled knowingly back.

""Yeah,"" Annie admitted. ""Sorry.""

""Don't be. It's flattering. I'm sure Ethan would think so, too. It's not like he's doing all that exercise for nothing, right?""

Annie had returned her attention back to Ethan, who was going for another dive.

""Jake never exercised,"" Annie said.

""Hey,"" Katie took Annie's hand. ""Don't think about him. Be here, with us.""

Annie nodded.

""It's been really tough,"" she said.

Katie patted her hand.

""I can't imagine.""

Annie sniffled, holding back tears.

""How could you? You've got Ethan."" A tear ran down her cheek. She wiped it away immediately.

Katie sat up, turning to Annie.

""Something's up,"" Katie said. ""Tell me what's wrong.""

Annie sniffed again, shook her head.

""It's dumb.""

Katie rubbed Annie's shoulder.

""It's not dumb. You can tell me,"" she soothed.

It was true. Ever since they met in college, Annie felt like a long lost sister. The friendship and chemistry was immediate.

Annie took a deep breath, fanned herself.

""I haven't been able to..."" she fumbled, looking for the words. ""I have a hard time now, with..."" she gestured vaguely to her lower body.

Katie understood. She took Annie's hand.

""Oh, Annie,"" she said. ""That's rough. I'm so sorry.""

Annie went scarlet.

""Oh, my god, it's so embarrassing!"" It was like a flood gate had opened. She leaned closer, speaking in a raised whisper to Katie.

""I can only just barely reach my clit with the vibrator, but it's not enough! I can't get the dildo in anymore, and the hormones make me so horny! Like,

all the time!

""

Katie couldn't help but grin at Annie's sudden, unabashed honesty.

""Don't laugh!"" Annie cried, hiding her own smile.

""I'm not laughing!"" Katie replied. ""I get it! I totally get it. Do you want me to stuff one in there for ya? I've got a couple upstairs I use when Ethan is away.""

Annie nearly choked. She whipped her head toward Ethan, to make sure he hadn't heard.

""Katie! You're married!""

Katie shrugged.

""You're my best friend,"" she said. ""You know I'd do it.""

Annie's face remained red.

""I know,"" she said. ""Honestly, though? At this point I'm so pent up, I don't think a dildo would help much anyway. But what guy is going to want anything to do with,"" she gestured to her body. ""

This

whole situation?""

Annie sighed, sipped her water, then laid back to watch Ethan swim.

""You're so lucky you get to have

that

in your bed every night,"" she muttered.

Katie raised her eyebrows, staring at Annie. When Annie noticed, she looked ashamed.

""Oh, my God,"" she said, covering her face. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.""

Katie grinned.

""Looking is free, sweetheart,"" she said. ""I understand, though.""

Katie turned to look at Ethan.

""The exercise has made him a better fuck, too.""

Annie sat up, taking off her sunglasses, her eyes wide.

""Katie!"" she said incredulously. ""Don't-- don't put those images in my head right now! I'll go crazy! It's been months since I've had proper sex!""

Katie stirred her iced tea, sipped, then said,

""I can arrange to have that fixed.""

Annie looked confused.

""What?""

Katie sipped again.

""I can get you laid.""

Annie scoffed, put her sunglasses back on.

""I'm not interested in some weird escort or a friend of a friend. I'm not comfortable with strangers like that.""

Katie set her drink down.

""It wouldn't be a stranger,"" she said. ""You can fuck Ethan.""

Annie's mouth hung open.

""That's not funny,"" she said, a touch of anger in her voice.

""I'm not joking,"" Katie said simply, adjusting her bikini top.

Annie leaned in slightly, trying to process what was being offered.

""I couldn't do that! He's your husband!"" Annie whispered.

""Yes,"" Katie stated evenly. ""He's my husband, and you're my best friend. We all know and love each other, and you're hurting. I can gently make the suggestion to Ethan, and you'll be able to get some good dick in you tonight.""

Katie smiled wickedly.

Annie began to speak, stopped, then,

""Even if I

did

agree to... that generous arrangement, there's no way Ethan would do that to you.""

Katie frowned.

""It wouldn't be cheating. It's my idea."" She shifted her legs in the chair. ""I think it's pretty hot, to be honest.""

Annie, still unsure, laid back in her chair. She seemed to be watching Ethan again.

""How would that even... work?"" she asked.

""Well,"" Katie said. ""He'd get hard, and put it--""

""You know what I mean!""

Katie shrugged, said,

""He can come over to your place tonight. Whatever happens, happens.""

Annie fanned herself harder.

""What if he says no? I don't think I'll be able to face him ever again if he saw me as some kind of sex-starved perv.""

Katie laughed.

""You ARE a sex-starved perv.""

Annie shot a fed up look at her.

""Look,"" Katie said. ""I'll make it work. You'll have a great time, and it'll help you destress.""

Annie gazed at Ethan longingly.

""Would Ethan even

want

me like this?"" she gestured to her very pregnant self.

Katie nodded resolutely.

""Definitely.""

Annie cocked her head.

""How can you be sure?"" she asked.

""I've caught him watching pregnant porn.""

Annie gaped. Katie explained, relishing Annie's bashful astonishment,

""Oh, yeah. I was surprised at first, too. He was so embarrassed, it was really cute. I ended up jacking him off to it.""

""He likes pregnant women?"" Annie said, leaning closer.

""Yep. I got it all out of him that night with some dirty talk as I stroked him. I asked him, did he like those big bellies and those swollen tits? He loved it.""

Annie looked to Ethan, pressing her thighs together. She seemed to be looking at him in a new light. Katie bit her lip.

""You want to know what sent him over the top?"" Katie asked slyly.

""Y-yeah..."" Annie whispered, gazing at Ethan. ""Tell me.""

""I asked him if he wanted to suck on those big tits while he came inside."" She snapped her fingers. ""He came instantly.""

Annie's nipples poked erotically against her swimsuit.

""He cums

a lot

, just so you know. I'm sure you don't mind,"" Katie teased.

Annie licked her lips. Her chest began to rise and fall a bit heavier.

""I don't know,"" she sighed. ""Maybe... maybe, if it's really okay with you... I do... really need it... bad..."" she shook her head, trying to compose herself. ""But ONLY if Ethan is one-hundred percent okay with it. He's my friend. I don't want to ruin that.""

Katie giggled, stopping as Annie playfully smacked her arm.

""I just need you to do one thing for me,"" Katie warned.

""Anything.""

Katie's smile grew.

""Send lots of pictures.""

~

Up until that evening, Ethan thought he had a pretty good handle on his life. He finally had the house, the pool, a decent job, and he had Katie. What more could life throw at him?

Apparently there was plenty.

But out of all the highly unlikely, nearly impossible situations he could've found himself in -- high speed pursuit, bitten by a radioactive spider, alien abduction -- the very last thing he would've imagined would be an offer from his wife to have sex with their mutual best friend.

Who was also very pregnant.

Still, he was embarrassed to admit, he hadn't needed much convincing from Katie.

Now here he was, standing on Annie's doorstep in the orange glow of the evening sunset, willing himself to knock.

Was this some sort of trap? A test? Had he already fucked up by agreeing?

No. Katie doesn't do that sort of thing. She actually always had a wild side. Was something like this really outside of the realm of possibility?

And did Annie really want this, too?

Katie said everything was taken care of. Just head over after dinner, and help Annie out.

That they could do whatever they wanted.

After Ethan managed to collect himself enough to get ready, Katie had smacked the condom out of his hand.

""You won't need that,"" she said.

Ethan's heart pounded against his chest. This couldn't be real. He must've hit his head diving into the pool.

Annie opened the door before he could knock. She immediately looked to the floor. He looked away, too.

""Hi,"" he said.

""Hi.""

They stood that way for a long moment.

""Do you want to... come in?"" Annie asked.

""Yes, I'll come inside."" He quickly added, as Annie's face went bright red, ""the house! I'll come inside

the house

with you!""

She led him beyond the foyer into the living room where they sat on the couch. It was cozy, inviting.

It really was a great house. Ethan never liked Jake, but Jake had done well for himself. It was probably because he was fucking a higher-up at his job, or so Katie told him in confidence one day.

How could someone just abandon their spouse and unborn child like that? It was unthinkable.

""Can I... get you anything?"" she asked.

""No, thanks. You should be taking it easy, anyway.""

Annie managed a sweet smile at this.

""You've always been so nice to me,"" she said.

Another awkward silence followed.

""We don't have to do this if you don't want to,"" Ethan offered, scratching the back of his neck.

""Oh! No!"" Annie started. ""I mean, if you don't want to do it, then... it's okay, really!""

""Well, Katie is okay with it, so..."" Ethan trailed off.

Annie looked at him.

""Are you okay with it?"" she asked.

She was wearing a loose-fitting dress that looked quite comfortable withnher bump. It was low cut, or rather appeared to be low cut due to her large breasts, which pressed supply together, nearly bursting from the soft cups. The skirt stopped mid-thigh, and he was able to see her fantastic legs as she curled up on the couch beside him.

Annie was beautiful. How could he not have seen that before? He had been so focused, so in love with Katie, he just wasn't the type of guy to look that way at other women.

Annie had done up her hair, the brown locks flowing to her shoulders, framing her little face, her amber eyes that drank him in.

""Yeah,"" he whispered.

Annie blinked, gazing at him.

""Okay,"" she whispered back.

""Should we just...?"" Ethan asked, nodding toward the stairs.

Annie smiled, stood from the couch.

""Come up in five minutes, okay?""

Ethan swallowed, his throat dry.

He watched her go. She had just a little bit of an awkward, adorable waddle as she navigated her bump around the couch and up the stairs.

He managed to catch a peek of her panties beneath the hem of her skirt as she cleared the landing and disappeared upstairs.

Time seemed to slow to a crawl as he waited. He kept checking his phone, taking a deep breath, checking again.

At last, he got a text before the five minutes were up:

ANNIE: I'm ready

Ethan stared at the text for a long minute, took a deep breath, then went upstairs.

The hallway light was dimmed, and the door to the master bedroom opened just a crack. He called her name softly, pushing open the door to a dark room.

""I'm... here..."" Annie called nervously.

""I can't see anything,"" Ethan said, laughing awkwardly as he shut the door behind him. ""Is it okay if I turn on a li--?""

""No!"" Annie squeaked, her voice lowering to an embarrassed hush. ""No, please. I don't look very attractive right now."" She managed a stiff laugh.

Ethan stepped forward gingerly, groping into the darkness.

""Don't be silly,"" he said. ""You're beau--""

His knee hit the side of the bed. He sat down, hearing the subtle shifting of sheets.

For a moment, only their breathing could be heard.

""Do you want me to touch you now?"" Ethan asked, his throat still dry.

Annie took a deep breath in the dark.

""Y-yes.""

Slowly, Ethan edged his hand across the soft sheets until he felt her ankle. She tensed suddenly at his touch. He stopped.

""If you want me to stop, just say the word,"" Ethan said gently.

Annie took another deep breath.

""Keep going.""

Ethan let his fingertips glide slowly from her ankle, up her shin, to rest on her knee. She was laying on her back, her knees raised into the air. He stopped, waiting there.

""I-it's okay,"" she reassured him. It sounded like she was saying it to herself too.

Ethan let his hand slide down her thigh. Where he expected to meet the skirt of her dress, there was nothing. His hand grazed her bump, came to rest on her hip. She trembled ever so slightly.

Annie was laying on the bed beside him, in the darkness, completely naked.

Her body was so soft and smooth, and extremely warm. It felt as though she were almost burning up at his touch.

Ethan only then realized how painfully swollen his cock had become, straining against his pants.

""What would you like me to do?"" he asked softly in the dark.

Annie caught her breath.

""Touch me... there..."" she asked.

Ethan swallowed, let his hand slip from her hip, across her thigh, where he met a soft patch of pubic hair. He continued until he felt the aching heat of her lips.

Annie was wet.

Soaking wet.

As his fingers met her pussy, Annie exhaled sharply.

He began to massage her labia, her legs softly spasming each time he brushed near her sensitive clit.

Ethan's cock jumped again. His breathing quickened alongside hers.

""Sorry I couldn't--mmm--sh-shave first,"" Annie said, her legs still jerking as he continued. ""Katie of--ahh--offered to, but I told her it was okay. I hope you d-don't mind.""

Ethan shook his head in the dark, letting his fingers comb her hairy mound.

""Not at all,"" he reassured. He liked the natural feel.

He let a finger enter her. Her feet pressed against the bed, lifting her butt up slightly as he buried it to the knuckle, sliding in with little resistance.

He curled his finger upward inside of her, and began to massage in a ""come here"" motion.

The sheets rustled as though she were clutching them so hard, pulling at them, unable to control herself.

Katie was right. Annie needed this badly.

""It must've been so hard to be like this without any help,"" Ethan said, still fingering her. With his free hand, he began to squeeze his bulge through his pants.

""Yes!"" Annie sighed. ""It's been awful!""

Ethan let his finger slide slowly from her. Annie let her knees fall, then rise again, craving more.

""Can I take my clothes off?"" he asked.

Annie shuddered.

""Yes.""

Ethan stood from the bed, took off his shirt, his belt.

Pulling down his pants and boxers together, his erection sprung free from the waistband.

""Do you want me to put it in?"" he asked.

""Not yet,"" Annie said. ""I want it in my mouth first. I miss the real thing.""

Ethan blushed. He'd never heard Annie talk like this before. While Katie was the wild firecracker in his life, Annie had always seemed so reserved and shy. Tonight, it was as though she was revealing a whole new version of herself to him.

He moved to stand beside the head of the bed. His eyes were beginning to adjust to the darkness, and he saw the vague shape of Annie as she awkwardly repositioned to her side, moved closer to him.

A beat passed, then her fingertips found the head of his cock in the dark. He exhaled as she gripped him gently.

""Oh, my God,"" she whispered to herself, her fingers exploring his shaft. ""You're... big.""

Ethan looked down, surprised.

""I am?""

More rustling, then he felt her hot breath at the head of his cock. His heart skipped a beat.

""You're

so

much bigger than my ex,"" she said, and kissed the tip. ""I knew it.""",,2025-08-15T19:01:19.984116,3413,

: This story is a continuation of ""A Wife Learns Her Place"" (about a wife's first time watching her husband have sex with another woman, and getting off on the humiliation of it), but it can also be enjoyed as a standalone. I like the ending to that first story just the way it is, so this one is more of a ""what if"": What if the happy couple from that story went all the way down the rabbit hole? Where would they be half a year later?

_______________*_______________

More and more of late, I find myself obsessing over a simple question, with a simple answer, which I am completely unable to wrap my head around: ""How?"" How did I get here? How did

she

get here? How did we transform our lives and our marriage into this? How did it happen so fast? And how in the world am I so at peace with it?

The only answer I ever seem to find: ""One day at a time."" It's not very helpful.

*****-***-*****

Bright & early Monday morning, I rolled out of bed and padded down the stairs in my nightshirt. I made my way to our kitchen, where I could hear David moving around. I arrived to find my husband already dressed for work, leaning against the counter and scanning the newspaper while a sipping a cup of coffee. He looked up as I came in.

""Mornin'. Big day!""

""Yikes. Big day,"" I agreed.

""Are you nervous?""

""You could say that. Are you?""

He stopped to consider the question. ""Nope, I'm really not. It's gonna be great. And

you're

gonna do great -- I know it, even if you don't.""

""Ha, thanks; I'll trust you on that,"" I said. ""Can I make you breakfast?""

""No, thanks Kim, but I have to go in early. I'll grab something on the way."" He paused for a second as a thought occurred to him. ""But, I do think Mia deserves a special breakfast today. Can you take care of that for me?""

""Of course, you're right. If she gets up early enough, that is. I have to be out of here in an hour.""

""She's already stirring; I think she'll be down soon."" He checked his watch. ""Yep, I've gotta run. I'll see you tonight, sweetie."" He stopped to kiss me on my forehead before grabbing his briefcase and heading for the door. As he walked out he called back to me, ""Big day, big day...""

There was no telling if or when Mia would actually materialize, so I went back upstairs to get ready for work. School was starting today and, as predicted, I'd gotten the job. Now 38 years old, I was the youngest Headmaster in the school's long history, and today would be my first day of classes. Of course I wanted to look good for it, so I'd chosen my best suit -- gunmetal gray, pencil skirt, perfect fit; unmistakably expensive. As I did my makeup I caught sight of my constant companion: the necklace David bought me for my last birthday -- my day collar. It was discreet, but meaningful, and held in place by a small lock in the back; I did not hold the key.

When I got back downstairs I saw Mia, eating a fruit salad at the kitchen table and browsing her phone. Shit, I didn't actually expect her to make it down in time.

It had been just seven months since her first date with David -- seven months since she'd helped me live out my greatest fantasy by fucking my husband, while I watched and wallowed in the humiliations they'd doled out. It turned out to be such a powerfully intoxicating moment that I never really sobered up. I just kept setting up more dates with her. Five months ago, when she learned she'd been accepted to graduate school at Northwestern, we celebrated by giving her a key to our apartment so she could come and go as she pleased, fucking David whether or not I was there to watch. Four months ago, we'd closed on our new house and joyously invited Mia to come stay with us. Three months ago we moved in: I watched David carry Mia across the threshold and almost fainted with jealous arousal.

Through all of this, David was so considerate. We both knew I was the one pushing things forward, drunk on his and Mia's dominance, but every step of the way he was checking in with me, giving me outs -- ""Are you really ok?"" ... ""Are you sure about this?"" ... ""Do you want us to pump the brakes, take some time for ourselves?"" I realized the other day that he hadn't asked me those questions in a while. I wondered if would ask tonight.

But for now, there was Mia, at the table. Christ, even just rolled out of bed she was painfully, effortlessly beautiful. I wouldn't have time to change, but I'd told David I would help her with breakfast, so that's what I was going to do. I walked in.

""Hello there,"" I said.

""Hey there! Big day, huh?""

""That it is, that it is..."" We shared an awkward silence for a moment. Awkward for me anyway, and maybe even for her as well. Lots of things left unsaid just at this moment.

""So..."" Mia said, trailing off.

""So,"" I offered, ""what are you up to today?""

Mia shrugged. ""Whatever I want, I guess. Gonna get ready for tonight."" She still had two weeks before she had to be at school -- maybe the end of her last summer vacation.

""Right, right ... well, on that note, David thought you should have a special breakfast today, which makes sense. But I do have a time thing now, so if you wanted to skip it, we could--""

""Skip it? Aw, hell no, Kim. I love special breakfast! Come on, we'll make it quick.""

That was predictable. Mia went right back to eating that fruit salad she'd pulled out of the fridge as I walked up to the table. I took off my jacket, hiked my skirt up above my knees, and crawled under the table. Mia was wearing just an oversized t-shirt and no panties; she slid forward on the chair so I could get to her, and suddenly I was face to face with her honeypot. I took in the view for just a second before diving in.

I was tickled and tormented by the scene all at once. Here I was, a confident, successful woman dressed to the nines in my finest business attire, and I was starting off the day of my professional triumph by worshipping this brat's ravenous quim. Because I'd been told to. At work, I was in charge, and even before I was in charge I'd been accustomed to having other people defer to me. But at home, this college girl was the boss of me. So was my husband, but mostly he delegated to Mia and let her set the rules, which made it all the more humbling. Why did I let this continue?

The warm, slick tingle between my legs helped answer that question for me, and I found my enthusiasm for the task at hand. The thought of what I must look like right now set me off. Remembering what we had planned for tonight set me off. The taste of her increasingly juicy pussy, which I'd long ago learned to love, set me off. But somehow what set me off more than anything was the fact that Mia just went right on enjoying her breakfast, like I wasn't even there.

After a few minutes she finally acknowledged my presence. ""Ahhh -- I tell you, Kim, this is the best way to wake up. You oughta try it some time. Hey, maybe you can find someone even weaker and subbier than you to play with."" You'd think I'd be used to it by now, but still her barbs struck home; my face flushed and my groin tingled.

""I guess that's pretty unlikely,"" she continued. ""But who cares. What matters is that you are getting

really

good at this. Mmmmm ... I mean it, sweetheart, you should be proud: you're an expert now. And what did I tell you the very first time we met? I promised to turn you into a world-class muff-diver, and I keep my promises. Isn't that right, Kimmy?"" I peeled my lips off of her to answer.

""Yes, Miss Mia,"" I said, and then went right back to work. We'd dropped the whole 'Miss Mia' routine ages ago ... except for when my tongue was inside of her, which was often.

""Ahhh, but this really hits the spot. I was going a little crazy -- he hasn't had has dick in me in over a week, been saving it up. Say, how long has it been for you? Haha..."" She laughed at her own joke. We both knew the answer: not since my birthday; not since July. I sped up my tongue to stop myself from thinking too hard about it. ""Oooh, yeah, there it is. Mmmm ... So tell me Kimmy, are you looking forward to tonight?"" I stopped lapping at her just long enough to reply.

""Yes, Miss Mia.""

""Hey, no, hold on."" She leaned back so she could see my face beneath the table. ""Tell me the truth, not just what you think I want to hear. You might as well, at this point.""

Jesus, she wanted the truth? How long did she have? I'd thought of little else for the past month. The sick thing is, I really was looking forward to it. Once in a while a wave of dread would wash over me, but only rarely. Mostly I was eager. Mostly I thought it was exciting. Mostly I even thought it was a

good idea

. The problem, of course, was that it's hard to be rational about something when the mere thought of it makes you flood your panties.

After a pause I was able to look her in the eye and answer.

""Yes, I'm looking forward to it ... it's complicated, but yes."" For once I peered up at her from between her legs and saw what looked like sincerity and affection. Wow. She treats me like a real person most of the time, but when we play together I'm always her toy. The mask had slipped for a second, and it was jarring. It wouldn't last long.

""Good, so am I."" She smiled warmly and ran her fingers through my hair, then the mischief returned to her face and she guided my mouth back to her clit; I attacked it with zeal, grateful for that small moment of kindness. ""Oh, Kimmy ... my sweet, sad humiliation junkie ... Mmmmm, yes ... you did so well to find me, Kimmy -- I'm just what you needed ... ohhh, fuck yes ... you'll see, it's gonna be glorious, and you made it all possible ... now do your fucking job and make me cum...""

It didn't take long after that. I worked to get her off as fast as I could; she sighed and squirmed and soon came with a shudder, gracing me with a tiny gush from her hole. When I crawled out from under the table Mia took one looked at me and guffawed. ""Oh man, Kimmy, you should see what you look like,"" she said. I already knew: a supposedly classy lady who, at 7:30 in the morning, wore disheveled hair and smeared wet makeup, reeking of pussy.

""Kim, if I told you go in to work like that, would you?"" That froze me in place: the mere possibility that she was serious -- and that, if she was, I might actually do it.

""Ha! Just kidding. I want you have a great first day; it's important."" She came right up to me so she could kiss me twice, once on each cheek. ""And believe it or not I am very *

kiss

* very *

kiss

* proud of you."" Then she backed off for a second before planting an intimate, lingering kiss on my lips -- a rarity, that. Today really was a big day.

""My god, Kim! Can you imagine it? By this time tomorrow I could be pregnant.""

*****-***-*****

I cleaned myself up, reapplied my makeup, and arrived on campus only a few minutes later than I'd planned. I thought I might be too distracted given the morning I'd just had (and the evening still to come), but once I got to work, as always, I found my footing and reverted to my usual self. Or is it my other self? My former self? I don't know.

The day went well, and for the most part I didn't even think about what was about to happen to my world after the bell rang. The only hiccup was running into one particular teacher towards the end of the day. No one outside of David and Mia knows what's going on with us, and so far no one at work seems to have caught the significance of my new necklace ... except possibly Ms. Ramos. She's young and smart and cute. She's also cocky -- probably a little too hip for her job as a high school English teacher, and she knows it. Actually she kind of reminds me of someone. She hasn't said anything, but every time I'm with her now I imagine I can see her glancing at my necklace and giving just the faintest smirk. I'm not sure, it really might be all in my head. When I mentioned this at home, Mia was delighted. She joked (I think) that we should invite her to stay the night some time.

Of all the crazy things Mia threatened me with that first night, that's the only one she hasn't followed through with: the idea of having me bring in other women for David, people from my real life, and thus outing myself in the process. Oh, she brought in a friend of

hers

for David one time, but she hasn't seemed eager to do anything like that since, and sometimes I wonder why. Maybe she's looking out for me and my feelings. Maybe it's about safeguarding the emotional stability of our little triad. Maybe it's jealousy: she doesn't want to run the risk of David falling for someone else and replacing her, in kind of the same way that she's supplanted me.

And in rare, tortured moments, I think maybe she's just making sure not to fuck up the good racket she's got going: great sex with my husband, a submissive little helper in yours truly, free room & board in a ritzy neighborhood, a besotted married couple paying most of her tuition ... and, if things go according to plan, a baby, along with all the support needed to keep her career on track at the same time.

But I don't think that's it. Nobody could be that conniving, and Mia's no sociopath. Anyway, I try not to think too hard about that possibility.

*****-***-*****

When I got home around 4:30 in the afternoon I was alone. David wasn't due back from work for another hour or so, and Mia was off doing who knows what, probably preening for our special occasion. Since we decided to have a baby -- since we decided to have a baby

like this

-- Mia had been keeping careful track of her cycle, and tonight she'd enter the start of her most fertile time.

I was more and more anxious with each passing minute, unsure of whether I'd be able to go through with it all. Just so I'd have something to do to keep my mind occupied, I decided to start getting things ready for tonight. I freshened up and put on a modest silk negligee, then went to prepare the bedroom (our bedroom in theory, but mostly

their

bedroom). I cleaned the room, played with the lighting, put fresh sheets on the mattress, and lit a few candles -- it felt cheesy, but appropriate. I was thinking about music to cue up for later when David walked in; I hadn't even heard him arrive.

""Oh, Kim-Bear,"" he said, ""this looks great, thank you. And

you

look great, wow.""

He came up and hugged me tight, even lifting me off the ground a little, and I was suddenly hit by a wave of memory and emotion. It was like the clouds below me had parted and I noticed, as if for the first time, that I was standing on top of mountain.

First, I was struck by an awareness of how rare this had become: a real moment like this with my husband. It's not that I never saw him, or that he wasn't loving; it's just that I so seldom saw him

alone

, unless we were busy with something else or rushing off somewhere, like this morning. There was so much I loved about our new lifestyle, but that realization hurt.

Then, still in his arms, I couldn't help but think back to him holding me like this on our first ""big day."" It was my birthday, almost two months prior -- the first time wearing my new collar, and the last time to this point I had made love with my husband.

*****-***-*****

Two months ago...

My god, it's so completely fucked up. This is a tangent, but it's important. And I can't not write about it.

We had decided, David & I, to get pregnant. It wasn't out of the blue, of course. We had always intended to start a family, but invariably there was some reason to put it off. Now it was clearly time: I was in my late-thirties; we had money, established careers, and a big new house; and we were still completely in love and committed to each other, with a marriage that was happy & stable. Maybe that last one sounds absurd with Mia in the picture, taking my place in the marital bed most nights, but somehow it was more true than ever. We still had the same emotional bond, and now our sexual satisfaction was through the roof. Once we closed on the house, it was understood that we'd start trying; I ditched my birth control.

That part of it was all lovely and wholesome. The fucked up part came when we turned it into a game: Russian roulette with our family tree. I honestly couldn't tell you exactly when it happened. At first it was just a private joke among the three of us -- 'can you imagine, hahaha.' Then it turned into dirty talk sometimes when we were in bed, just one more thing for Mia to tease me with. Then it was part of our dirty talk

every

time.

And then it came back from the land of dirty talk in the form of a real plan: Mia and I would take turns trying to get pregnant -- first past the post wins. If this offends you, all I can say is: blame me. All three of us were riding the same high, and I provided as much momentum for the idea as anyone. Look, I'm not stupid; I could see which way the wind was blowing, and I could have put a stop to it. But the realer it became, the hotter it was. And wasn't Mia family now, in every way that mattered?

My birthday present from Mia was that I got first crack at my husband's baby. My birthday happened to fall in what looked like a good time in my cycle, so that's when it happened. We got dressed up, had a few drinks at the bar, went out for a fancy supper, then came home and hit the bedroom.

I was a nervous wreck, but David & Mia both were being so tender that night: standing on either side of me, planting kisses here and there as they caressed my body and slowly stripped off my clothes. They guided me to the bed where they continued to lavish attention on me. Mia kissed her way down my body then dove into my pussy to get me ready -- she so seldom does that for me, but she's amazing at it.

Before I could cum like that, David positioned me on all fours with Mia's inviting cunt in my face. He began a steady, pounding rhythm, his hands gripping my waist so strongly; Mia stroked my hair and dripped honey in my ear while I tried my best to focus on her pleasure. Knowing that we were fucking with purpose made the whole thing so special. I was sandwiched between my husband and my live-in dominator, my face being pushed forward into her crotch again and again. Each stroke was like a little reminder -- a perfect physical manifestation of my new life. It was unsettling to realize how much I loved this.

Mia came with a shriek as she clenched my hair in both hands and held me in place; it hurt, but it was a good hurt. David slowed down behind me and I lifted my head to look up at Mia's face. She smiled sweetly, approvingly -- she stroked my cheek and ran her thumb across my bottom lip; I latched onto it and sucked hungrily. She let me suckle for a minute before moving over and guiding me to take her place in middle of the bed.

David climbed on top of me, between my splayed legs, and stared meaningfully into my eyes; he kissed me then and I thought I was falling in love with him all over again. ""Ready?"" he asked me. I couldn't trust my voice so I just nodded. He looked over at Mia and she nodded her approval as well. David rose up on his knees, slipped his manhood inside of me, and started off slow. He wrapped his arms around my thighs, holding my legs up off the bed.

Mia let David get started and then pressed up against my side, facing me. She draped her leg across my midsection; her left arm snaked under my neck, supporting my head, while her right lay atop me, alternately hugging my shoulder or running over my breasts or caressing my face. Between the two of them I was completely swaddled -- helpless, but secure; locked in, but precisely where I needed to be.

Mia completed the moment. She used her finger to tilt my head to face her, held my stare for a long moment and then said simply: ""I love you, Kim."" She'd never said it before, at least not really. She might say it breezily ('love ya, babe'), or ironically, while reveling in my latest act of servile debauchery ... but never like this, like a lover. Or a partner. I tried and failed to respond with words and my mouth hung open like I was a fish; Mia saw me dangling there and let me off the hook, covering my mouth with hers so that all I had to think about was her kiss.",,2025-08-15T19:01:25.790801,3880,

The two SUVs pulled up onto the grass in front of Rob's family's lake house. The place was more of a large cabin, with an expansive deck that led down to the lakefront, where two small boats were docked. The sound of music pumping from a stereo echoed across the water. A few people milled about on the front lawn, holding beer cans or bottles, smoking cigarettes. The majority of the hoots and hollers came from the back deck, though. Evening approached.

The small squad of women, with Trevor in tow, emerged from the vehicles. The few people on the lawn openly stared as the retinue trapsed across the lawn, and rounded the house. Trevor led the way toward the deck, his arms around Tara and Amy's waists. He felt like a king. They took the wide steps up to the deck, and the party-goer's attention shifted to the new arrivals. Trevor counted, maybe, a dozen people on the deck, including Rob and his brother, Juan.

The two of them were part Hispanic, with light brown skin and dark hair. Very handsome. Rob approached his friend with wide eyes, and pulled him in for a hug.

""Amigo,"" he said into his ear, ""You are a fucking hero!""

Trevor smiled back, and Rob stepped aside, motioning to his brother.

""You know Juan."" he said.

Juan gave Trevor a nod, and a thumbs-up, his grin broad.

""Good to see you brought the party, Trevor!"" He said.

Stacy stepped forward and wrapped Rob in her arms.

""Ayi, Stacy!"" He said smoothly. ""Good to see you, mama. Sexy as ever.""

""Robbie."" She said, and ruffled his dark hair.

Juan approached and gave Stacy a friendly kiss on either cheek, saying, ""This is the gorgeous Stacy mi hermano has had a crush on for so long, eh? Tan hermosa! Rob did not tell me you were like una diosa. A goddess.""

""Más como un demonio."" Stacy replied with a grin. More like a devil.

Juan's eyebrows raised, and his grin broadened further.

""You are all welcome here. Who are your lovely friends, mi amor?""

He put his arm around Stacy's waist, and turned to the other women. Stacy named them off in turn.

""Rob,"" Juan called, and his brother appeared, ""You can see to drinks for all the bellas chicas?""

""Absolutely! Trev?""

Trevor and his friend took the ladies inside, as Juan swept Stacy away toward his private cooler. Soon after, the women were milling through the crowd, drinks in hand. Rob and Trevor cracked a beer. Trevor had only had a few drinks in his life, and beer wasn't very good, he thought, but he didn't want to be rude.

""Dude,"" Rob said, ""How in the fuck did you pull this off?""

Trevor shrugged. ""It wasn't really my idea. It was all Stacy.""

Rob cast a glance over to where Stacy was giggling at whatever his older brother was saying to her. There was plain envy on his face.

""Of course he'd be all over her. Bastard."" Rob said.

""Stacy?""

""Yeah, dude. You know your sister is totally banging. Sorry, my friend, but you know that.""

""Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure she's not going to pick a guy fresh out of high school over some college dude. Sorry, bud.""

Just then, Stacy broke away, giving Juan a peck on the cheek. She started over in their direction, snagging Tara by the arm on her way.

""Oh, shit!"" Rob muttered. ""They are coming this way. Dios me salve!""

Trevor looked a question his way, but he only shook his head and tried to act casual. Stacy draped her arm over Rob's shoulder, and Tara put hers around Trevor's waist.

""Thanks so much for the invitation, Robbie."" Stacy said. ""Your brother is really nice. Bad choice of cologne, though.""

Rob laughed. ""It's that stinky shit from the mercado."" He said, shaking his head sadly. ""I tell him it smells like donkey piss, but he does not listen.""

That brought a laugh from all of them.

""I hear that you're leaving for school in the fall."" Stacy said, making conversation.

Tara squeezed Trevor's butt playfully, making him jump. He shot her a sheepish look, but she only grinned.

""Would you care to escort me to the bar, baby?"" Tara asked him. ""I could use another.""

""Sure."" Trevor agreed, leaving his sister with Rob.

When they returned, Rob was posted up on one of the outdoor couches with Stacy in his lap. They were speaking Spanish.

Trevor and Tara sat across from them on another couch. The gorgeous blonde made herself comfortable in Trevor's lap, draping her arm around his neck. Trevor cracked a grin at his friend, who was completely under Stacy's spell.

""She's got that look."" Tara said.

Trevor raised an eyebrow in question.

""That's her 'you are going to get your dick sucked' look. Robbie is in for quite the evening. Hope he jerked off today, or it's going to be a short evening.""

""No way."" Trevor stated flatly. ""She wouldn't do that. To Rob?"" He shook his head in denial, but he watched the way Stacy giggled and touched his best friend playfully. She teased the rim of her beer bottle with her tongue, giving him flirty eyes over it as she sipped.

Tara watched his face taking it in.

""Oh my God!"" She whispered. ""You're totally jealous!""

Trevor snapped his gaze to her.

""N...no I'm not! That's... she's my sister!""

Tara's soft, mocking giggle in his ear sent a shiver down his spine.

""Do you really think I can't tell when a guy is jealous, baby? I've made plenty of them feel that way. You want it. I can feel how hard you are right now, just thinking about your sister sucking cock.""

She wiggled her ass against his crotch. Stacy stroked her nails down Rob's chest, inching closer to his dick.

""I'm not."" Trevor denied it, but he knew he didn't sound convincing. He was thinking about it. He did want it to be him. After all the petting, kissing, the way she'd played with his cock, all the dirty things she'd said during his lessons. It should be him with his cock in Stacy's mouth.

""It's going to happen soon."" Tara said.

Stacy leaned in close to Rob's ear and whispered something that made his eyes glaze over. He gave a quick nod of his head. Stacy pressed her lips against Rob's and Trevor knew from experience that she was putting her tongue into his mouth.

""See?"" She said, pushing her ass against his hardon. ""Give it just a minute. She'll make an excuse, probably to get a tour of the house. Wait for it.""

Stacy's hand rubbed the bulge in Rob's pants, and then she broke their kiss. She stood up, took a swallow from her bottle, and then Rob got to his feet behind her.

""Rob's gonna show me around a bit."" Stacy said, then to Tara, ""You don't mind keeping Trev company for a while?""

""Of course not."" Tara agreed, smirking. ""He's in good hands.""

""Lead the way, Robbie."" Stacy said.

Rob cast Trevor an almost apologetic look, and led Stacy inside.

Once they were gone, Tara gave Trevor a teasing smile and said, ""There you go.""

Trevor couldn't hide the look of disappointment on his face. Tara ran her hands through his hair.

""Oh, Trev. Don't be so glum. We can find somewhere to play, too.""

She kissed his lips, but he didn't respond. She sighed.

""Wow! You've really got it bad. Ok. How about we go listen in?""

""What?""

""Yeah. We follow them, and listen in. I doubt they'll be so indiscreet as to leave a door open, but it would be really hot to listen to your sister suck your buddy's cock. What do you say?""

""I... I don't know.""

""Well, I know. I want to listen. Are you coming?""

She stood up and offered her hand. Trevor took it, and let her lead him into the house. Tara seemed to either have some kind of Stacy location sense, or they just thought enough alike these days that she knew the kind of place Stacy might pick. Probably both. Tara scanned the room. No real privacy here. She spotted a staircase, and led Trevor to it. A few of the party goers gave them knowing glances as they went up. On the second floor ran a hallway with four doors. The nearest, on their left, was closed. Across from it, the door was open.

The closed door did practically nothing to muffle the sounds of a girl moaning and spitting filth.

""We found Amy."" Tara said with certainty. ""And probably no less than four of the male guests."" She added.

Trevor flushed. They walked a few more feet. The next door on the left was also open, which left only the closed door across from it. Tara put her finger to her lips and then placed her ear against the door. Her eyebrows went up, and a fiendish smile crossed her lips. She nodded, and motioned Trevor to do likewise.

He shouldn't. It was wrong. He shouldn't be spying on his sister, or imagining her sexy lips pleasuring his friend's cock. He put his ear to the thin wood of the door and heard Rob's voice muttering in Spanish as he groaned. The low sound of wet sucking reached their ears. Tara's eyes lit up and she suppressed a giggle.

""Just wait. Any second now.""

A second later, they heard Stacy's voice say, ""God, you don't know how long I've been waiting to do this, Robbie. You were hiding this fat cock from me for so long. Didn't you think I wanted to suck it, baby?""

""Stacy, mama, I have dreamed of you for years. I...ah! Aaaawww!""

The sounds of slow, sensual sucking continued, mixed with the low groans of pleasure.

""This is so fucking hot!"" Tara whispered.

As sick as it was, Trevor had to agree. He'd never spied on someone doing something like this. He couldn't help the sick feeling in his gut, though, thinking of Stacy's soft lips being used to pleasure his friend. Tara rubbed her pussy under her skirt as she listened to Rob's obvious enjoyment. There came a wet pop, and they heard Stacy's voice again.

""Come over here."" She said. ""I want you to fuck my mouth.""

Tara reached over and fondled Trevor's cock through his jeans. He didn't stop her. His attention was focused on painting a mental picture of what was happening from sound alone. They heard the two on the other side of the door shuffle across the floor, then the sound of a squeaky bed. A moment passed, then they heard the sound of, ""gluk... gluk... gluk... "" as Rob shoved his cock back into Stacy's mouth.

Trevor's shoulders slumped. He knew exactly what was happening. It was just like Stacy described while she was jerking his cock to the porno. He could see in his mind's eye his sister on her back, head hanging off the bed, her black hair sweeping across the floor as his friend mauled her tits and plunged his happy penis into her tightly sucking mouth.

""Let me suck you."" Tara begged, her hand rubbing her pussy. ""Please Trevor. This is so hot!""

Trevor shook his head, and said, ""I... I can't. I'm sorry.""

Tara rolled her eyes, shook her head, and whispered, ""You really are a good boyfriend.""

Instead, they continued to listen to the sounds of Rob pumping his cock into Stacy's mouth, as well as the occasional soft slap of his hand smacking her tits, and Stacy's muffled groans of pleasure. After several long minutes of this, they heard the wet squelching noises become more frantic. Rob began to mutter something in Spanish, and then he said, ""I'm cumming, mama! Oh Dios mio!""

There was a quick shuffling about, and then another groan, louder this time, followed by the sounds of lude sucking and swallowing. Tara bit her lip and came on her hand as Trevor watched, his penis so stiff in his jeans that he felt like it would burst the seams. Tara took him by the arm and nodded down the hall. They crept away, and at the end of the hall she pushed him roughly against the wall and kissed him, pushing her tongue into his mouth. For a moment he was so shocked and aroused, that he simply responded out of reflex. Then, he regained his senses and pulled away. Tara looked disappointed, but she smiled at him kindly and hugged him.

""Come on."" She said, ""We should get back down.""

They took the stairs, and Tara led him to the bar for another drink. This time, he took another beer. Together, they returned to their little couch, and resumed their position. Trevor kept stealing glances at the door. Tara was talking to him, but it seemed like it was coming from the background. He felt stupid. Why was he feeling jealous over his sister?

He knew that Stacy didn't see him that way. What they were doing was just her weird way of helping her awkward little brother. It didn't mean anything. He was just a horny idiot, letting his dumb dick get to him. Stacy wasn't his girlfriend. He had a girlfriend. His girlfriend was cute and sweet. Stacy was a slut with big tits and a dirty mouth. His cock responded happily to this thought, and that made him feel worse.

A few moments later, Stacy came through the door with a new drink in her hand. Rob followed her, but they split up. Trevor saw him walk to his brother, where they bumped fists and Juan's face broke out into a knowing grin. Stacy took a seat on the couch next to Trevor and Tara.

""Enjoy the tour?"" Tara asked with a smirk.

""Yeah!"" She said, ""There wasn't much to see, and I don't think I'd come back, but it's a cute place.""

Tara stood up and said, ""I think I'm going to find Amy.""

She kissed Trevor on his hair. Stacy turned to her brother, who was staring at the ground and twirling his half-empty bottle in his hand.

""You ok?"" She asked.

""Hmm? Yeah. Fine.""

""What's up?""

""Nothing.""

""Come on. Show me the dock."" She stood and held out her hand.

Trevor hesitated, then took it and stood. They walked down the steps to the dock, and stood in silence for a moment.

""Did you really have to... you know... do that... with him?""

Stacy was quiet for a minute, then replied, ""Trev. I've sucked a lot of dicks. It didn't mean anything. Robbie's been lusting over me for years. I just wanted to give him a little going away present. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.""

She touched his arm and seemed genuinely regretful.

""It's not that."" He said, and shook his head, kicked a stray branch into the lake. ""I'm just never gonna hear the end of it. He's gonna brag the rest of his life about how my sister gave him head."" He rolled his eyes and shrugged, playing it off.

""Uh huh."" Stacy said, unconvinced. ""You're not jealous?""

""What? No!"" he scoffed.

""This is my fault."" She said. ""I should have never started those stupid lessons. Now you're all hot for your sister. We should probably stop. I'm so sorry, Trev. Sometimes I get these ideas that sound great at the time, but they're actually pretty dumb.""

Trevor felt a wave of panic. No more lessons?

""No!"" He said, a bit too forcefully. ""No. It wasn't a bad idea. I really appreciate it. I'm learning so much, and, well... I guess I just kind of felt like we were getting closer since you came home. It's my fault. I'm sorry.""

She hugged him and said, ""I feel the same way. It's a lot of fun, having a dirty little secret, isn't it?""

His penis hardened, and he nodded his head.

""Tell you what,"" She whispered, ""When we get home, I'll make it up to you. I'll teach you something really special. Just remember... ""

""We're not going to fuck."" Trevor said, and shivered.

""Even though it would be really hot, we're not going to fuck.""

Chapter 14: How to Make a Girl Your Slave

The drive home proved far less eventful than the drive in. The girls were tired now, having slaked their lust with boys from the party and alcohol. Amy, in particular, was nearly comatose, falling asleep on Trevor's shoulder. She'd borrowed someone's hoodie and a pair of sweatpants that were too big for her. Her own clothes had been so caked in jizz that they were unrecognizable, as though every man in the party had used them (and her) as a cum rag. Stacy dozed on his other shoulder as Tara drove. Rachel had her head resting against the window.

""Do you guys need to crash here?"" Trevor asked kindly, as Tara pulled into the driveway.

""We'll be fine."" She yawned, and gave him a tired smile.

He nodded, and walked to the house with Stacy. The lights of the SUV panned over the front door as she reversed, and drove away. Inside, Stacy giggled as she climbed the steps, holding the rail for support, slightly tipsy. Trevor, by contrast, had nursed two beers over the whole evening and was feeling no effect. At the top of the steps, she whispered, ""Give me a few minutes, and I'll come to your room.""

He nodded, went to the bathroom, and cleaned up. He waited in the dim light of his room for several minutes, and then Stacy crept inside, shutting his door quietly and locking it. She was dressed in a long black robe. Stacy pushed him onto his back on the bed, and crawled up next to him.

""Thanks for the party."" She said softly, and kissed him.

He let her probe his mouth with her tongue, his dick stiffening in his boxers. After a few minutes of this, she pulled away and whispered, ""Are you ready to learn something new?""

He nodded eagerly.

""Take off your clothes."" She hissed, and he quickly complied.

She pointed to the ground, and he knelt on the floor. Stacy sat up, and undid the belt on her robe. She peeled it off of her shoulders, then let it fall. Trevor gawked openly at her naked body. Even during the previous lessons, she'd never let him see her naked. She'd always left her bra and panties on, or been in her bikini. His eyes were wide with wonder at his first look at a real naked woman.

She stroked his hair and said seductively, ""Do you want to know how to make a woman your slave?""

He nodded.

""You're going to make me beg for your dick."" She said.

""I am?""

She nodded and continued, ""You're going to learn how to eat pussy.""

He stared in wonder, eyes dropping to her closed legs. She parted them slightly, revealing her naked sex. It was beautiful, he thought.

""Come closer.""

He inched closer. Stacy spread further. She took his hand and extended one finger, bringing it into contact with her wet slit.

""Slit."" she said. ""There's a lot of parts down there, and they all react differently. I'm going to teach you how to use them all to make me cum. Feel me.""

Trevor carefully ran his finger through her slick channel, feeling the way it spread apart at his touch to reveal the soft, inner folds that were wet with her arousal. The smell of her was enticing, pleasant. He could feel the way her body trembled slightly when he touched the entrance to her pussy.

""We'll get to that part, too."" She said, then took his thumb and guided it up to the top of her slit. She pulled back a little fleshy hood, and he saw a tiny button peaking out. Her clit, he knew. She grazed it lightly with his thumb and quivered.

""That's one of the magic spots."" She said, ""and the other one is inside. Clits are sensitive little things, and very finicky. Too much pressure and it hurts. Too little is just a tease. When you find the right balance, I'll let you know. They really like repetitive motion, so when you find the right technique, you hone in on it and you keep it up like a clock keeping time. I want you to lick me, from the bottom to the top, and then use the tip of your tongue on the clit. For me, little circles work best, but everyone is different. The fun comes from exploring, and learning what your woman likes. Trust me, there's no such thing as a bad time when getting your pussy licked, but there's also a masterful way to do it. You're going to be a master.""

He nodded.

""Lick.""

Trevor stuck his tongue out and licked from the bottom of Stacy's wet pussy, running his flat tongue up her moist channel, coating it with her delicious cream, until he felt the tip of his tongue touch her clit. He wriggled his tip against it, moving it in slow circles that made her sigh with delight. She reached down and took his hands, placed them on her bare legs.

""Don't ignore the rest of her."" She instructed. ""It's like we learned before. You can't use your mouth to get into her head, but you can use your hands to work on the rest of her. Legs, tummy, thighs, breasts. Just keep them moving and touching.""",,2025-08-15T19:01:32.322915,3610,

Make sure you read the others, the cast of characters is getting large. In this one, we get to see more of the slutty office co-worker Diane. Also, Debbie's life gets pretty interesting pretty quickly.)

***

The next day things got even better at work. Diane wore a more revealing outfit than normal. Her cleavage was again displayed but this time her skirt was also very short and flirted with revealing her ass when she walked. When I went to lunch, she hopped up from her desk and followed me to the elevator. Getting in with me she immediately came up to me and grabbed my hand. ""Is that finger better?"" she asked as she shoved it into her pussy. I couldn't believe how wet she was and she was clearly not wearing any panties which I imagine is what she wanted to show me. ""Don't go to lunch. Just spend an hour doing this. My husband's at work and my house is close. Let me show you what I'll do that that wife of yours won't.""

""Diane... "" I said. I'd only planned on a quick lunch and I had a lot of work to do. My boss would eventually start thinking of me as the world's best employee but that might take awhile. ""I fucked my wife in the ass last night while she ate a girl out."" Okay, okay... That was a couple weeks ago but the point was there to make.

Diane just stood there and stared at me and I pulled my finger out. I gave it a suggestive lick as the elevator door opened leaving her standing there dumbfounded while I walked to my car. I planned on letting her simmer for awhile, curious as to what she'd come up with. Denying her was ramping her up and I wanted to enjoy it when she burst.

I grabbed a quick bite to eat and returned to the office. Diane was obviously not ready to take ""No"" for an answer. There was a folder on my chair and in it was a black and white picture of her, completely naked. She was as gorgeous as I had imagined. I quickly shredded the picture, however. I planned on getting pictures and video a lot better then a grainy black and white. But I figured this was a good chance to try to prod her a little more. I picked up the phone and dialed her extension, ""Diane, can you come in here please?"" 15 seconds later she was striding into my office. ""Shut the door please,"" she closed the door with a smug look. She clearly thought she was winning. ""Let me show you something,"" I said and opened up my Gmail account. I clicked on my starred emails and up popped a long list of emails from Kay. Many of them had very explicit headers. I picked one, however, that seemed to be innocuous, ""Something for you,"" it said. Up popped a picture of my wife (post tattoo and bleach job). She was bent over with her hands cuffed behind her back and a dildo sticking out of both holes.

Turning back to Diane, she was standing there staring. ""You see Diane. My wife tries very hard to keep me satisfied."" Diane shook herself out of her daze and walked out without saying a word. I glanced through a couple other pictures of my wife before getting back to work. There was a consulting job coming up that would be a perfect chance to take things up a notch with Diane. I went down to my boss's office. ""Are you still looking for someone to go with me to Miami?""

""Yeah... We've got several people in the office that can go... ""

""Let's send Diane. You said you want some of the more junior people to get chances at this stuff. This should be pretty low key so it ought to be a good chance.""

""That's a good idea. That'll keep the job cost down, too. I'll get it on the schedule. You're flying out tomorrow?""

""Yeah, just two nights so I'll be back Friday night if you need me."" I had our secretary, Laura, make the travel plans and send Diane an email. I didn't want it coming from me because I didn't want her to know how eager I really was. I finished up my work for the day and went home. I was pretty satisfied with the work I'd done both professionally and personally that day. Diane was going to be all kinds of fun for the next two days. When I got home, Debbie's car was in the driveway. My dick got hard thinking about her and my wife going at it inside. However, when I opened the door, I was greeted by an entirely different site.

My wife was sitting on the couch getting yelled at by two girls while Debbie was crying. Kay was trying her best to stay calm but I could tell instantly that the berating had been going on for awhile and was nearing her limit. ""What's going on here? Why are you screaming at my wife?"" I yelled. I was pissed.

One of the girls broke off and came over to me, ""Debbie got home last night and her clothes were ripped. She was a mess. We thought she'd been raped or something. When we asked her about it she said she'd been over here fucking you two!""

""So... "" I said, playing dumb.

""Bullshit! Debbie wouldn't even think of that. She's the most innocent, naive person I've ever met,"" Debbie started sobbing again.

""See, now you've hurt her feelings,"" I said. ""Look... what is it you're worried about?""

""We think you forced her to do it. Either you got her drunk or you blackmailed her. You did something."" She was close to the truth and yet so far away. I had planned for something like this and had made a quick addition to the video from last night. I was pretty sure that one or both of Debbie's roommates would pull something like this. From what I'd heard from Debbie, they were pretty bossy and nosy and treated her like she was a little girl.

As preparation for this, I had burned a couple quick messages onto the video from last night already.

-You trust Jay-

-This video is sexy-

-This video turns you on-

-Jay is sexy-

-Girls are sexy-

I had no idea what effect these would have. So far I hadn't tested the messages on someone who saw them once and never again. The effects didn't appear to be incremental, they appeared to be abrupt at the time limit for that individual but I had no idea. This gave me the opportunity to mess with Debbie's roommates while experimenting more with the technique.

""Debbie, can you think of some way to reassure them that you were 100% willing last night?"" I asked.

Debbie looked downward at the ground and said, in a soft voice, ""The video... ""

""Oh that's right, we videotaped it all last night, didn't we."" I looked over at my wife with an evil grin. She was beaming back at me. I'd forgotten that she'd thrown out all of her old clothes so she was sitting on the couch wearing Daisy Duke shorts and a tube top. She'd probably been dressed for me when the girls got there. I pulled the DVD out of the computer and put it into the player. While it was starting up, ""What are your names, girls?""

""Tiffany and Daphne... "" one of them said before getting a ""why-the-fuck-would-you-tell-him-that"" stare from the other. I looked at the girls for the first time. Tiffany was a lithe redhead who reminded me a lot of the stripper from a few weeks prior. She looked like she might have been a dancer at some point but her breasts were larger than you would have expected for a dancer type. Daphne was shorter and blonde. She was a little curvier than her friend. Both of them were very cute and I was already mentally adding them to my harem.

The video started and the five of us watched. Kay had pressed up beside me and Debbie was clearly aroused from the whole situation. The humiliation and embarrassment of all this was driving her crazy and I could see her trying to inconspicuously rub her legs together.

Tiffany and Daphne both gasped as they saw Kay blowing me on the video. I knew that this part went on for 15 minutes but I was content to let them watch. The more they watched of the video the more (I hoped) that the messages would take effect.

""We didn't come here to watch some homemade porn of you and that slut wife of yours,"" Daphne said. Instead of being upset, Kay just beamed a smile and reached over to place her hand high on my cock and rub it as if showing it off to the bossy girl. This seemed to upset Daphne more and she turned back with a ""humph"".

""I can fast forward it if you'd like.""

""Yes please,"" she said indignantly. I noticed that Tiffany wasn't nearly as upset and seemed to be staring at the video. I hit fast forward and Kay's image started bobbing frantically up and down on me. The effect was comedic and helped to break the ice just a little bit. I stopped when I saw my head turn toward the front door.

The scene unfolded on film exactly as I remembered it. Tiffany and Daphne stared for awhile at the film, unable to believe their eyes. Kay was now overtly stroking my cock through my pants while Debbie was practically shaking in the corner. I think she had come a couple times already. When we got to the part about my declaration that I wanted to show the video to her roommates she came again, twitching like she had last night.

Daphne snapped her head and yelled at me again, ""You wanted to show this to us? What is wrong with you?"" Tiffany was still watching the video. I was pretty sure that she'd be interested in fooling around without the messages at all. On screen I was now pounding away at my wife.

""Nothing's wrong with him,"" Kay said defensively.

I smiled lasciviously at Daphne and pointed back at the screen, ""This is the best part."" When she turned back around, I unzipped my pants and motioned for Kay to service me. My dick was rock hard after the flirting with Diane and the current encounter and it filled Kay's mouth. Daphne was watching, slack jawed, as Debbie started eating my wife in the video. On the other hand, Tiffany's legs were now rubbing together and her breathing was shallow. Debbie, for her part, had now openly crammed a hand down her pants and was sitting on the floor behind her roommates. The smell of sex was thick in the air.

When I told Debbie to leave on screen, Daphne once again turned to me and started to protest. Instead, she was cut short as she watched Kay bob up and down on my dick. She quickly shook herself free, ""You people are sick!"" she said and then realized that Debbie was frigging herself on the floor with abandon. ""Tiffany, let's get out of here!"" she said, getting even more irate. She realized that Tiffany was still watching the video and her hands had drifted to her chest. She grabbed her roommates, pulling Debbie's hand out of her pants and breaking the spell over Tiffany. The three of them left though only one of them really wanted to. Kay simply continued working on me and I quickly shot my come into her mouth.

After licking me clean, she looked up at me and said, ""That went well.""

""Did you see that Tiffany chick? I bet she'd have stripped right there for us if her bitchy roommate hadn't been here.""

""And Debbie. She came just watching the video,"" Kay said.

""By the way, I'm going out of town tomorrow. I'll be gone for a couple days."" Kay pouted.

""Big job? Who's going with you?""

""Small consulting job. Just Diane and me.""

""I'll be sure to send you videos every night,"" she said seductively.

""Be careful, Diane's hot. You wouldn't want me getting uncontrollably turned on would you?"" I was testing for the effects to take over. I knew they'd hit today or tomorrow.

""I thought we discussed this last night. Your cock is for me,"" she glanced at the video which had started looping back. ""Well mostly me... ""

""Of course dear,"" I told her.

The next day was a rough one. I woke up early for the flight and drove to the airport. When I got to the gate, Diane was already there. She was dressed very professionally. I'd actually worried a little bit about that but she must have realized that flirting with me brazenly in front of clients wasn't going to when me over. We sat together and talked briefly about the job. It really was a simple job and should be relatively relaxing. When they started boarding and the crowd around us cleared out a bit, Diane said, ""Let me show you something."" For a second, I thought she was going to flash me in the airport, but I needn't have been alarmed. She unzipped her carry-on and showed me what she'd packed. Inside were two work outfits and then a huge pile of lingerie, toys and pornos. I was impressed. She had to take the bag through security and most people wouldn't be crazy about the x-ray tech seeing their vibrators. Let alone the chance of needing a full bag search.

""That's... interesting, Diane. We'll discuss this more tonight."" I boarded the plane and she followed me. We had a layover in Atlanta that forced us to pretty much sprint across the airport. I enjoyed running just behind Diane as she jogged the concourse. We got to our plane and arrived in Miami without further incident. I got a bit of work done on my computer but it's not that long a flight and I was distracted thinking about the evening ahead. We got the rental car and hopped in. Diane was sitting very close to me but keeping the discussion professional. And when we got to the client and she was stayed professional (thank goodness) after that. If anything, I think she was trying a little bit harder to impress me then normal. I'm not a partner so there's no reason to kiss up to me professionally. I can only assume that she thought this was yet another way to seduce me. Either way, it made the day fly by quickly and we drove back to the hotel. She still hadn't tried anything and i was wondering if I had rejected her too hard. We got our rooms and headed to the elevator. I was on the 2nd floor and she was on the 3rd. However, she decided to get off on my floor with me. ""Where are you going?"" I asked.

""Jay, stop it. We both know that you're going to fuck me. We both know that I'm going to do whatever you ask.""

""Diane, let me show you something."" I asked her to my room.

""Is this more of your wife's porn? I don't care. Fine, she's a cock pleasing slut. But she's not here right now. Unless she's flying down to meet you and fuck you in the hotel room, the fact is you won't be sticking your dick anywhere fun tonight unless it's in me."" She was completely brazen now. We were standing in front of my room and I swiped the card. I opened the door and then grabbed her and pulled her in.

""Blow me,"" I told her. She didn't hesitate a bit. She dropped to her knees and unzipped my pants before the door even had time to swing shut. I grabbed her by the back of the hair. ""Man you can suck cock,"" I told her as I tried something I'd always wanted to do but my wife wasn't able. I started thrusting my dick into her mouth, basically fucking her face. She took it like a champ. No gagging whatsoever and her tongue continued to work on me while I did it. Finally, I was ready to finish and pulled out and told her, ""This is going to be the most degrading night of your life,"" as I shot my come all over her. Her face was covered but her tongue was working to wipe it all up. I opened up my overnight bag and took out my camera to snap some pictures. ""I think I'll be sending these to Kay. She'll probably finger herself to sleep watching them. She's usually the one sending me naughty pics so this will be a good way to return the favor.""

""So is that what you like? You want to control a girl? You want her to be a cheap gutter slut for you?"" she said. She was stripping out of her clothes as she did and I marveled at the sight. Her body was so much nicer than the photo she'd sent me. Her tits were firm and her waist tiny. Without her clothes she could pass as a pornstar. Her mocha skin contrasted nicely to mine and the pinkness of her areolas matched her lips almost perfectly.

""If you want to be with me, that's what you need to be. If you can't do that, you can get out right now."" I told her.

""You can make the decision after tonight."" She said. ""Just give me a chance.""

""Fine. But don't fuck up. Like I said, I've got a nice cunt at home waiting for me."" I knew the constant reminders about my wife would drive her. She was a classic Type A personality and I had intentionally played on that.

She stood up and took her bag to the bathroom. While she did that, I went over to the bed and laid out my clothes, hanging my suit up in the closet. By the time I was finished, she came out from the bathroom. I felt my dick go hard again as soon as I saw her. She looked like the hottest $50 whore you've ever seen. She was wearing a tiny jean skirt and garter belt and stockings. Her heels were 5 or 6 inches. She was wearing a tiny halter top that left parts of her tits hanging out the bottom. Best of all, she hadn't bothered to do any cleaning up from the cum that I'd blasted on her face. I took a picture of her then set the camera up to record. ""Well you do look like a cheap gutter slut, I'll give you that."" I motioned for her to spin around. She wasn't entirely comfortable on the heels but she gamely pirouetted anyway. The skirt was so short that her ass was hanging a little out of it and that made me twitch yet again. ""Now that you know what I like, tell me what you want me to do to you.""

""Anything,"" she said trying to sound seductive.

""I don't want submissive, bitch. I get that from my wife and her friend. I want a slut under my control but I want her to be slutty first and foremost. If you can't figure out the difference then this isn't going to work. I'm sure Laura would be happy to take your place,"" I said, raising my voice. I think that was the opening Diane needed. Now she knew how she could be ""better"" than my wife and boy did she run with it. The best part was, this wasn't her kink. I hadn't changed that. I just made her want me and prodded her enough over the last few days that she'd do anything. That thought made my cock go completely rigid.

""I want you to fuck my ass. Not gently either. I've never been fucked in the ass but I'm sure you'll make me like it. I want to fuck you in the hotel pool. I want you to fuck me while room service watches. I want to spend every car ride with my mouth wrapped around your cock. I want you to make me do things that I would never do otherwise. I want to be your personal whore and cumdump. I want to fuck anyone you tell me to for any reason.""

""And what about your husband?""

""Fuck my husband. He's never made me feel like this. What you and I have is nothing like what I have with my husband. I wouldn't even call it cheating.""

""Go back to your room and hang up your work clothes. You will NOT let your work suffer because of this and I want you looking and acting presentable. Do you understand?"" Diane nodded ""Good. Then come back here ready to get everything you want."" When Diane walked out I watched her ass go and then I called my wife. I was fairly certain the next wave of programming had kicked in so I was prepared to have a little fun.

""Heya honey,"" she said when she picked up the phone. ""I've got someone here who wants to say 'Hi' to you. She can't come to the phone right now, though. She's got some work to do. Isn't that right bitch?"" she said.

""Tell Debbie I said 'hello',"" I said with a chuckle. ""Guess who just threw herself at me?""

""You're kidding? Diane? Isn't she married?""

""Yup... but that didn't stop her from coming up here dressed like street trash trying to get me into bed,""

""That little slut! I hope you fucked her good... uuhhh... right there slut,"" she said while clearly being distracted.

""I didn't want to do that until I talked to you. I wanted to honor your concerns,""

""Don't worry about that. I realized that with you on the road, you're going to have some little escapades. Besides, with all these women throwing themselves at you, we really should start a little harem. That's why I've got Debbie over here. I want her to be well trained by the time you get home."" Yup, the programming had kicked in.

""Well, you'll be happy to know I came all over her face and then sent her back to her room.""

""Oh that is hot, baby!"" I wasn't sure if she was talking to me or Debbie.

""I've got a picture if you want it,"" I told her. I had already queued it up to send.",,2025-08-15T19:01:38.389095,3805,

*****

The next day Kim and I woke up around 10 am the next morning. We laid in bed, cuddling for a while together before we finally decided to get up. We shared a late breakfast together in the kitchen. We talked and laughed as we talked. I loved her laugh. I marveled at Kim. Everything she did amazed me. She was the perfect woman. Beautiful in every way. She was distractingly beautiful. She could captivate you. I had trouble thinking of anything else.

""Shit,"" I said at about 1130.

""What's wrong?"" she asked

""We forgot to let Kate out of her room,"" Kim laughed out loud.

I went down the hall and unlocked the door for her. Kate was waiting on her knees in the center of the room. She was squeezing her knees together. She had to pee. Her room did not have it's own bathroom. I needed to remember that. ""You can come out now,"" I told her

After relieving herself, Kate followed me back to the kitchen where Kim was finishing up her breakfast.""Good morning Kate,"" she said pleasantly ""How did you sleep?""

""Very well, thank you,"" Kate responded. ""Did you and Mr. Johnson sleep well?""

I wrapped my arms around Kim from behind and kissed her on the neck. She smiled seductively. ""Yes,"" she said ""we had a very good night, thank you"".

I took my seat across from Kim. Kate eyed the open chairs at the table as if hoping she would be invited to sit, but she knew she wasn't allowed at the table. She kneeled down in the floor beside us. Kim and I chatted for a while. Today was the day that we were supposed to be having a party. Kim's friends were going to start coming over around 4. That gave us several hours to kill until then. We had decided to go see a movie in the afternoon and now we just needed to pick which one. Kim wanted to go see a cheesy chick flick, so thats what we decided.

After we had decided Kim turned toward Kate and uncrossed her bare legs, displaying her pussy for Kate to see. I could see dried cum from the night before caked on the inside of her thigh. Kim beckoned for Kate to come closer. Kate crawled across the floor toward Kim. I watched as she sniffed the air. Kim's hand went to the back of Kate's head and guided her in. This time Kate did not resist.

""Oh, good girl,"" Kim cooed at her. ""There you go.""

Kate licked Kim's used vagina diligently. I wondered if Kate liked the way my cum tasted. I knew she could probably taste it.

""Ah, this is amazing. I want this every morning for the rest of the week,"" Kim told her.

Kate did not pause to respond. She just kept licking Kim's pussy. After she was licked clean Kim pushed Kate away.

""Thats enough for now,"" she said. ""Babe, let's go take a shower, then we can leave."" In the shower I finished what Kate had started. I loved making Kim cum.

After that we headed to the movie theatre. Before we left Kim told Kate what was going on.

""Tonight we are having a few friends over. While they are here you will wear the heels and dress that you brought. Keep the collar on. A few of my friends should be here around 4 o clock. If we are not back by then let them in and offer them something to drink. The key to the bar is on the counter. Tonight you need to be on your best behavior. I want you to meet everyone at the door. You will greet them by saying 'Hello sir or ma'am, May I get you a drink?' I want you to wait on people. Make sure their drinks are full and make them comfortable. If they tell you to do something, do it, just as if it were me telling you to do it. Also, during the party try to keep the house clean. That way it will be less work for you tomorrow. Do you understand?""

""Yes, Ma'am"", Kate answered her.

After that Kim and I left. We had a perfectly ordinary afternoon. First we went to the movie, then for a walk on the pier. Then on the way back we stopped for some frozen yogurt. It was all very... domesticated. We looked like a normal couple doing normal stuff on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. We made it back to Kim's place around 4:45. There were a few cars in the driveway.

We found Kim's friends out back by the pool. They had already changed into their bikinis and were enjoying some sort of fruity drink.

""Hey, girl!"" they said, rising to hug Kim.

""Hey! I'm so glad to see you!"" Kim answered them.

""Please,"" one of the girls answered ""We wouldn't miss this. We've been waiting to meet your new man for months now.""

""Well here he is, without further ado. Girls this is Josh. Josh these are three of my best friends Amanda, Kaila and Riley.""

I extended my hand ""It's nice to meet you"" I said to each of them. Amanda was the tallest of the girls. She had brown hair, and long legs. She wore a black bikini. Kaila was about the same as Kim. She had strawberry blonde hair and wore a red bikini. Riley was blonde and was the smallest of the three girls. She was half an inch shorter than Kim and very trim.

""He is hot, good job girl!,"" I heard Riley say out of the side of her mouth. Kate arrived around that time with drinks for everybody.

""So this must be his wife then?"" Kaila asked. Kim made a disgusted face and rolled her eyes.

""I mean, I guess on paper anyways."" Kim rubbed her hand up my thigh for emphasis. ""Okay, I'm going to get changed, I'll be right back.""

Kim's friends asked me a million questions while Kim was away. ""How did you guys meet? When did you know you wanted to keep seeing her? What was your first date like? First Kiss? plans for the future?"" I knew they had probably already asked Kim these same questions and now they just wanted to hear my side of things. After that they wanted to know about Kate. ""What does she think about this? Do you hate her? Are you going to leave her and be with Kim? What if you guys want children?"" I explained my and Kate's relationship to them as best as I could. They seemed to understand why I enjoyed it but they were at a loss as to why Kate would be interested in it. I suggested they ask her. While I was explaining I heard Kate offering to fill everyone's drinks.

""Ma'am?"" she said. ""May I refill your drink for you?""

""Yes please,"" Riley replied. When Kate returned with her glass Riley handed her a ten dollar bill. Kate looked at it confused. ""Don't worry,"" Riley told her. ""Kim asked us to tip you if you did well."" Kate reluctantly took the bill.

After Kate left I turned to Riley. ""What was that about?"" I asked her.

""The money you mean?. Kim mentioned something about telling people that Kate was working for her. She said it would be embarrassing for Kate. I'm still not sure why someone would want to be embarrassed. She's going to tell everyone that Kate is down on her luck and needed a summer job.""

Kim came back down a few minutes later. Today she had decided to wear a pink bikini. She had also changed her belly button ring. It looked like it might be diamond. ""Did I miss anything?"" she asked.

""Nope,"" Amanda answered her. ""We were just getting to know your new toy.""

We continued to talk casually. There was a lot of laughter and gossiping. I gathered from the conversation that they all knew each other from school. These girls were a few years older than Kim but were still in highschool when Kim was a freshman. Amanda and Kaila were 21. They were both in school at the same university in the next town over. Riley was 19. She had just graduated the year before Kim and spent the last ten months traveling instead of starting college. Kate waited nearby on her cushion.

Around 5:30 I heard the doorbell ring. Other guests were starting to arrive. Kate rose to answer the door without being asked. Throughout the night I realized that the guest list was carefully and meticulously planned. Kim had designed it in order to humiliate Kate as much as possible, without jeopardizing her career. Most of the guests were one or two years older than Kim and were either in college or taking some sort of sabbatical. A lot of them had gone to Kate's school and recognized her. Many had been in her class. A few of the guest were Kim's age and were currently in Kate's class.

""Its perfect."" Kim explained to me. ""All of these people know her so it's super embarrassing but none of them will go back and tell on her. That means I can boss her around all night and treat her like shit in front of everyone without out any worry about repercussions."" Kim was diabolical.

I heard Kate answering the door. ""Hello, Sir,"" she said. ""May get you a drink?""

A male voice answered her ""Mrs. Johnson what are you doing here?!"" it must have been one of her students.

""I am serving drinks at Miss Brennan's party. Is there anything I can get for you?"" she answered him.

""No,"" he said. ""I can see what your doing but WHY are you serving drinks?""

It was Kim that answered for her. ""She's a little short on money so I let her work for me part time. Be sure to tip!"" I found out later that this kid's name was Kyle. He was another senior in Kate's class. He had just turned 18 a week ago and was an all-star athlete.

He laughed and handed her a dollar.

By 9 o'clock the house was pretty full. I had met dozens of Kim's friends and acquaintances. Most people were hanging out by the pool. A few had made their way inside and were lounging around on the couches. I watched Kate hurry around the party. Her face was flushed and she looked winded. I watched her fish an empty drink cup out of the pool. Her short dress and heels made it difficult.

""Hey server girl!"" a guy called from across the lawn. ""Moor beer!""

""Yes, Sir,"" She said. ""One second."" She hurried off to fill his drinks. When she finished the man fished something out of his pockets.

""Here,"" he said. ""I have a tip. This is uhhh... 74 cents."" He handed the change to Kate, his friends snickered.

""Thank you, Sir."" Kate said. ""Is there anything else I can get for you?""

""Nope,' he said. Kate turned to walk and when she did the guy gave her a huge slap on the ass. The smack could be heard all across the lawn.

""Ouch!"" Kate squealed. She was flustered and didn't know what to do. She laughed nervously and walked away. That wasn't the last time she was groped that night. As the party went on and people got drunk many of the male patrons fondled her. Her ass was a popular area to grab.

A little while after that I heard a loud booming laugh and then a loud voice. It was Kyle, the boy from the door earlier. ""So let me see if I understand."" he said. ""Not only are you working for Kim, but she's also fucking your husband!?"" Everyone at the party could hear the exchange.

""Yes, sir."" Kate answered, her eyes were cast to the ground.

""And that's okay with you?"" he asked.

""Yes, Sir."" Kate responded.

Kim and I were enjoying ourselves in the hot tub. Riley and Kaila were there with us. We were having a very interesting conversation about which celebrities gave the best blow job. Jennifer Aniston seemed to be the frontrunner.

""Okay,"" Riley said. ""I have to go to the ladies room. Kaila, wanna come?""

The two girls left and Kim and I were alone. She moved close to me and cuddled up against my arm. I felt her hand grasp my dick under the water.

""Hey, theres something I've been wanting to ask you about."" she said shyly.

""What,"" I asked her.

""Have you ever been in a threesome?""

""No,"" I said.

""Do you want to?"" she asked me.

I looked at her and thought about it. In all the years of fucking, I had done lots of crazy things but somehow a threesome wasn't one of them. I'm sure I could have arranged to have one with one of the past girls and Kate but somehow that didn't appeal to me. I preferred to keep Kate out of the bedroom as much as possible. I only even let her watch on special occasions.

""No,"" I answered. ""I think I'd rather keep you to myself. I think Kate would just mess things up.""

""I wasn't talking about Kate.."" Kim said sheepishly. ""I meant Riley.""

""Seriously?""

""Seriously."" she said. ""She thinks you're hot and she has a thing for mature guys. She asked me last week if we would be interested in anything like that and I told her I would ask. Why do you think she's been hanging around us all night?""

I thought about it. Of course she didn't mean Kate. That was stupid. I was suddenly excited about the idea of fucking one of Kim's friends.

""Okay then, yes. lets do it"" I answered her. My cock was hard in her hand. As if on cue Riley came back to the hot tub.

""Hey Riley, why don't you come over to this side of the tub."" Kim asked.

Riley smiled knowingly. She slid beside me on the opposite side of Kim. Kim took Riley's hand and led it to my groin. I felt Riley's hand grab me. Her hands were smaller than Kim's

""Wow,"" she said. ""Thats thick!""

""I told you,"" Kim said.

Kim and Riley came together in front of me and their lips touched. It was just a peck. and then another peck, this time a little longer. I watched as Kim opened her lips and bit Riley's bottom lip. Riley was still stroking my cock. The girls kisses became harder and more passionate. Kim let out a little sigh and their tongues met. after a few moments they broke off the kiss. Riley bit her bottom lip and looked at me, then sideways at Kim.

""Can I... do you mind?"" she asked Kim.

""No, go ahead,"" Kim said.

Now with permission, Riley placed her lips on mine. They were soft and delicate. I hear a sound from behind us.

""Ma'am, can I get you anything,"" She was talking to Riley. She must have seen us and came over to see what was going on. Riley looked at her with amusement.

""No, thank you Kate."" Riley told her. ""I think we are fine. Kim? Josh? Do you guys need anything?""

We didn't. Kate turned to leave and Kim called after her.

""Kate,"" she said. Kate paused to listen. ""Don't interrupt again. That was rude.""

""Yes, Ma'am,"" Kate responded.

We continued the conversation we had been having. Riley's hand was still on my cock. ""Hey, Riley, why don't you show him your tattoo?""

Riley stood up out of the water. she stepped over me so that my head was even with her waist. Then she slowly lowered her bikini bottom. Just above her pussy she had a small red heart.

""Thats cute,"" I told her. ""Let me take a closer look. I could feel Kate watching us from behind. I grabbed riley by her ass and pulled her pelvis toward my face, burying it in her groin. Riley laughed and wrapped her hands around my head. There was a loud crash and a splash behind us.

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled. Kim walked over to see what was happening. Riley and I stayed and watched from the hot tub. I could see that Kate had fallen into the pool.

""What happened,"" Kim asked.

The man answered. ""This bitch wasn't watching where she was going and nearly knocked me into the pool.""

Kate climbed her way out of the pool. ""Is that true?"" Kim asked her.

""Yes, Ma'am. I'm sorry. I was just uh.. distracted."" Kate was soaking wet.

""Tell him you're sorry,"" Kim commanded.

""I'm sorry, Sir. I didn't mean to run into you,"" she said.

""It's fine,"" He said. ""At least you went into the pool and not me.""

Kim looked at Kate for a few seconds. ""Your dress is wet. You need to take it off"" she said finally.

""Yes, Ma'am,"" Kate answered. ""May I borrow something else to wear?""

Kim nearly laughed. ""Are you kidding? Look at you. Do you think you would fit into any of my clothes? No. You may not borrow anything else to wear.""

Kate began to shake as she realized what Kim was trying to say. She hesitated.

""Kate,"" Kim commanded. ""Take off that dress.""

""Yes, Ma'am,"" Kate said in a soft voice. Her hand was shaking. She slowly reached for the zipper on the back of the dress. She pulled it down and the dress fell to her ankles.

There was a wide range of reactions at the party. Most people were laughing. Some were speechless. One girl was confused.

""What the fuck is that?"" she asked, indicating Kate's chastity belt. Kate looked at the ground. She wringed her hands in front of her like a child who had gotten in trouble.

""The bra too,"" Kim demanded.

Kate unhooked her bra and released her breasts. ""Good,"" Kim said finally. ""Now take that shit to the dryer and get these people something to drink.""

Kim returned to the hot tub with me and Riley. She had a wicked look on her face.

""Kim can I talk to you?"" I said.

""Sure, Riley, give us a moment?"" RIley left the hot tub.

""""What are you doing"" I asked her.

Kim looked hurt. ""Are you mad at me?"" she asked.

""No, I'm just... concerned."" I said. ""Do you think this has gone a little too far. I mean, what if someone goes back to the school or something.""

""But I thought you said I could make her do whatever I wanted to?"" Kim batted her eyelashes at me.

""Yes, but, Kim this is dangerous."" I told her.

""Do you trust me,"" She asked.

""Yes, of course I do."" I assured her.

""Then just let me worry about this, Okay? Please?""

""Okay,"" I said. ""I just wish I knew what you were planning.""

""Okay,"" she said. ""I'm planning on turning her into a complete and total slave to me. By the time you guys leave on Sunday I want her to belong to me as much as she does to you. I think it's important for our relationship that we share this role as her masters. I want her to be completely broken and bent to my will. If I decided to make her strip down and get on her knees in the middle of the mall on a Saturday afternoon, then she will do it with no questions. I promise I won't get her or you in trouble but Babe, you've got to trust me Okay? Let me run things this week? I promise it will be worth it.""

""Okay,"" I said. ""I trust you.""

The party went on and it started to become late. The people started to clear out but fifteen or twenty guests were still hanging around. Kaila and Amanda had left earlier. Riley had ridden with them but she assured her that she would find a ride later. I knew that was a lie. She had no intention of leaving. I had spent much of the night flirting with her. She seemed like a cool girl. She spoke a lot about her traveling and the places she had been. She was planning on being a political science major when she returned to school. Whenever that was.

As much fun as it was flirting and talking to Riley, it was much more fun to watch Kim flirt with Riley. There was a lot of sexual tension, between the three of us. The girls took turns stroking my cock under the cover of the hot tub water. We were all becoming slightly drunk. Kate had done a good job of keeping us topped off on drinks throughout the night.

There was another commotion. It was Kate again. ""No, I am not doing that.""

She was standing in front of the guy who had slapped her ass earlier. He was lounging in one of the lawn chairs casually. He had a $50 bill in his hand and waved it in the air. Kim left again to control the situation.

""What is going on,"" She asked.

This time Kate answered first ""He wants me to suck his dick."" she said.

""I wasn't talking to you!"" Kim snapped. Kate went quiet.

""I was just telling her that I would tip her but I only have a 50 and she might have to work... a little harder. Thats all"" the guy answered casually.

""I'm not some prostitute!"" Kate screamed at him.

""That is enough Kate!"" Kim yelled back at her. ""What did I tell you earlier?""

Kate stuttered, ""You said to uh... be on my best behavior and get people drinks and stuff.""

Kim's eyes narrowed. ""What else did I tell you?""

""I uh.. I don't know.""

""I said to make them comfortable and do whatever they asked of you as if I was the one telling you to do it."" Kim's arms were crossed in front of her.",,2025-08-15T19:01:44.304332,3769,
https://www.literotica.com/s/benefits-of-the-job-ch-01,Benefits of the Job Ch. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"They dined out at least once a week. Nelson ordered the New York strip, Suzanne the pasta primavera. A glass of red and a glass of white. They quietly talked. She told him of the class she was teaching, The American Novel. Gatsby was currently being discussed, which Suzanne loved. Nelson was not as enthusiastic. He preferred Wharton, about whom they had talked last week. This epitomized their relationship, at least one aspect of it, for she was an educated and insightful woman, a proud Dartmouth grad. Steeped in academia, she inhabited a world very different from his. He was an educated man as well, but his study of history had come at the United States Military Academy at West Point.

They had been brought together as a couple that might or might not work. She had been the more skeptical one, but Nelson's insights into Steinbeck had fascinated Suzanne. His acute understanding of history, in which he had majored, had won her over. Had he spent his military career in something like infantry or armor, it probably would not have worked. But intelligence had been Nelson's branch, in which he rose to lieutenant colonel in his eighteen years. The talk left Gatsby's world of the 1920s.

""And what was your day like?"" Suzanne asked him.

The answer could go one of two ways. It could be very mundane, for Nelson was a letter carrier. After the service, he had sought simplicity. And his postal service work added toward his federal retirement. His intent was to work until he had thirty years total between the Army and the USPS, and then move on. Most often, there was not much to tell. But on occasion, his response to the question went another way. Suzanne was waiting. And he gave her the answer that would get her complete attention.

""I had sex with one of my customers today.""

It was earlier that day, a Thursday. Nelson parked his truck at the end of Oak Street. Normally here he would walk two blocks down and back, beginning at the white house on the corner and delivering mail all the way. But today he gathered only a magazine and three letters. All the mail for the white house. He glanced at the handful. National Geographic, a credit card offer, a utility bill. And something from Stanford, which identified the recipient as an alum. That was Mia, who lived in the white house with her husband and two children. He commuted to work somewhere, and Nelson never saw him outside of Saturdays. The kids were in school. But on Monday he'd found her in the garden planting rosebushes, and she told him that she'd taken the week off. On Tuesday she was throwing a ball for their golden retriever, Splash. Nelson had paused, enjoying the display of her athleticism.

Mia was tall, maybe five--eleven he thought. Dark shoulder-length hair. Wearing shorts, as she usually was when he encountered her in the yard. Jean shorts that displayed her long legs. She was not slender, her body more shaped by activity. Once she had mentioned that she played volleyball in a community league. All of that was very nice, and the intelligence and achievement indicated by her education accentuated her physical presentation. It was the same reason he was with Suzanne.

Yesterday, Nelson had delivered a parcel to Mia. She'd offered him a glass of ice water, and he'd accepted for the excuse of engagement while he drank it. For about ten minutes they'd talked. About how relaxing it was to have some time off, although she had said that she appreciated his company during other otherwise alone time, saying this with a smile and a deliberate flash of her eyes. Subtle, but it was there. Nelson had glanced at her figure, enough to be noticed but not an ogling. Finally, he had said he needed to be getting on.

""Can't ever stay long?"" Mia had said with a mock frown. Nelson had just smiled and told her exceptions could always be made.

""I'll be waiting,"" she had replied.

Mia, of course, was simply very friendly. And perhaps innocently flirtatious. But Nelson didn't think so. Today he was ready for all eventualities.

The mailbox was by the door, but Nelson knocked anyway. Mia was there in a moment. Broad smile. The shorts. A t-shirt that was a bit tight.

""Is this all you have for me today?"" she said, taking the mail.

""Is there anything else you'd like?"" he responded.

She grinned.

""Come on in. I'm just working on the porch.""

Nelson was getting hard. He followed her. The view was magnificent, and he thought to himself that there was a little more sway to her ass than would be natural, but he couldn't be certain. If it was intentional, she was good.

The three-season porch overlooked the backyard through a wall of windows, but trees provided privacy from the neighbors. There were planting pots and bags of soil, but everything was tidy. Mia turned and hopped up on the table, her feet dangling above the floor. Her legs were parted slightly, her hands on the edge of the table. She looked at him and smiled.

""I was just about to get dirty,"" she said.

""I'd like to see that,"" Nelson responded.

Mia lowered her eyes and looked conspicuously at the front of his postal shorts.

""Looks like I'm not the only one.""

It was clear enough. Nelson moved forward to the table such that Mia had to part her legs even more to accommodate him. He leaned in to give her a kiss, and she tilted her head to receive it. His hand moved to her breast, felt through the shirt. Clearly she wasn't wearing a bra, and he felt her nipple go erect through the fabric. Then Mia scooted forward just a couple of inches until they were touching below the waist. His erect cock pressed, through their mutual shorts, against her pussy. Their kiss became more intense, then slowly their lips parted.

Nelson took a step back, but his eyes never left Mia's. Without leaving the table, she slipped out of her shorts. No panties, either. He could discern a full bush even without diverting his gaze. Again like Suzanne, he thought. Then he lowered his shorts. Nelson felt his cock pop out, now freed and erect. Mia raised her eyebrows.

""Oh my,"" she said, a reaction that was obviously both genuine and for effect.

Nelson had a big dick. Nearly eight and a half inches. The real size, not in the inflated world where everyone was packing at least eight. Its girth was proportionate. Not the largest male member in the world, but he knew that he was in the select few. He also knew that, physically, it did not matter much. But at the same time, there were intangible elements to being a member of the one percent. A lover had once described it as a unique experience, mostly psychological. Another had told him that it was flattering having a man with such at attribute focusing on her. It certainly did not hurt his confidence. Nor did the fact that he was tall and in excellent shape for a man of any age. Though he'd mostly spent his military career behind a desk, he'd been serious about physical training. Nelson had not the look of a gym rat but rather that of a man who ran every morning and ate well. This was running through his mind as he took off his shirt. Mia watched him as she pulled off her shirt. Lovely tits.

Nelson closed the distance between them, leaning into to kiss her as she herself leaned into it. His cock touched the inside of her thigh and twitched and he felt her involuntary reaction. He put his hands on her waist and slowly moved them up her sides while kissing her deeply. Without using his hands he maneuvered his cock so that it was against her, the shaft along the wet and receptive cleft between her legs. He moved, sliding the hard dick against the warm wetness. Mia kissed him more intensely now. He was thinking of Suzanne. Then, still kissing her, he moved such that the head of his cock was poised to enter her, and slowly he moved forward. As he filled her, she raised her legs into the hair and lowered herself to the table.

""Jesus,"" she whispered, her voice thick with both pleasure and the desire for more.

Now Nelson took her ankles in his hands, looking down to watch several times as his dick slowly disappeared between the ample pussy lips that eagerly took it in. She moaned, not an effect but a natural expression of pleasure that came from deep within, and he understood that the table was just the right height. He looked up to see her looking intensely at him and he began to firmly fuck her.

""You like fucking this married pussy, don't you?"" Mia hissed with an expression of ecstasy on her face. Nelson just grinned and worked his cock in and out of that married pussy.

""Fuck,"" she moaned, and there was no doubt that she'd be first.

He did fuck her. Nelson fucked her deep and hard, holding her legs high, watching her. Her body heaved and soon was doing so in conjunction with his thrusts, and she looked up at him in momentary wonder, her mask suddenly slipped.

""Oh God, Nelson... yes!"" she cried out as her legs spasmed.

He could have paced himself until she had finished but he was ready and wanted to begin even as Mia was in her own climax. With several more deep, deliberate thrusts he did, moaning himself at the moment that he began to fill her with his cum. She squealed with delight at this, which he knew must be an uncharacteristic display for her, and it compelled him to lean forward and kiss her again and he pumped and pumped into her. She was still quivering when he had spent himself.

Letting their lips fall away, Nelson spoke. ""I love your married pussy, Mia,"" he said with an expression somewhere between gravity and mirth.

With that, another hard spasm came from her, then several more gradually diminishing ones. Indefinable time then passed. When he pulled out, Nelson was surprised to see her reach over and take one of two white towels and hand it to him. She had prepared. He used it as she watched, then himself observed her as she used the other in a way that was marvelously dignified. Mutually comported, they came face to face again.

""This wasn't your first time,"" Mia noted.

""You could tell I wasn't a virgin, could you?"" he deadpanned, and she grinned and playfully slapped him on the arm.

""I'm not the first woman you've had sex with while working,"" she said.

Nelson smiled but said nothing.

""I don't think this was your first time,"" he countered.

""No, you're the first mailman I've fucked.""

He laughed.

""But not your first man on the side.""

Now it was Mia who had nothing but a smile.

Suzanne looked at Nelson.

""Who?""

Nelson told her. There was a long pause.

""Where did you... finish?""

""In her pussy.""

She took a drink of wine, saying nothing. He observed the emotions in her face. Suzanne was a strong and principled woman. Even as it was happening, he knew it had been a marvel to her that she had developed a relationship with a military man. But Nelson was intelligent and charming and principled himself. He also respected her. They had been dating for a few months when he announced to her one Saturday evening that he would likely be having sex with one of his customers the following week. Something in his demeanor had deflected her instinctual outrage. Questions followed, then explanations. The date had ended in a non-committal fashion on her part. He had called her that Wednesday after work and Suzanne had agreed to go out to dinner. During the meal, he told her about the sexual encounter. He was very matter of fact. She later admitted to being very conflicted, but he could already see that. Yet the arousal she felt had astonished her. It was the first night Nelson ever fucked Suzanne in the ass.

They finished their meal, quietly talking, and then they went to her home. Nelson took her into the bedroom, where he came up to her from behind and pressed against her and took her in his arms. He held her tits through her clothes and made sure she could feel his dick, hard and through their clothes nestled within the cleft of her ass.

""I thought of you when my cock was inside of her,"" she whispered into her ear.

She moaned, yet within her body he felt a conflict. Visceral arousal against the principled intellect. It seemed to Nelson that arousal held the upper hand. He put her on the bed on her hands and knees and undressed behind her. Then he lowered her pants and her panties and penetrated her. She preferred being face to face. It was intimate, she said. There was something about having him behind her, staring at her ass, fucking her as she looked away, that she found tawdry. It smacked of dominance on his part. She had confided this to him. But she had also confided that while she disliked it for this reason, for the same reason it aroused her.

""You make me want things that I don't like,"" Suzanne had once said to him.

Nelson fucked her. He fucked her casually. He slapped her ass, and as he did she stiffened but was unable to suppress another moan. Again, conflict.

""Don't move,"" he said, almost a command. Then Nelson withdrew from her and went and took two objects from the pockets of his cast-aside jeans. Then he penetrated her again. One of the objects he held in front of Suzanne so she could see it, a slender blue metal dildo. The other object he took and flipped open its cap and squeezed it so that oil came out as he held it over her asshole. Her body stiffened again. He placed the blue metal penis against her tight hole and slowly began working it. There was alarm in her physical presence, but Suzanne said nothing. In time, he worked it into her. Into her ass. Her body was slow in accepting it, but it did. All the while, he slowly fucked her. Eventually, she relaxed. Her asshole no longer tightly gripped the blue dildo. It had adjusted to what was inside of it. Nelson knew her body was ready.

He took his cock from her pussy and applied oil to it. Then he removed the blue dildo, and immediately pressed his dick against Suzanne's receptive asshole.

""Oh, God,"" she moaned as he slowly worked his large dick into her ass. Astonishment mingled with alarm in her voice. It took several minutes, but then he was balls-deep in Suzanne's ass.

Nelson thought there were four kinds of women when it came to anal sex. First, there were those who had no interest and refused to partake. He respected this. Then there were those who did not like it but participated to please their partners. For this, Nelson had no respect. There were also those who enjoyed anal sex and so indulged, a perfectly understandable position. Finally, there were those women who objected to anal sex. It did not pleasure these women in a conventional sense. In part, it left them mystified that they should like it, but like it they did. It humiliated them, and they found that some part of them desired humiliated. They thought of it as somewhat degrading, and to their utter surprise they discovered that there was an element to degradation that fascinated their sexual psyches.

Nelson looked down at his dick, buried in Suzanne's ass. He could feel in her response that she was of the latter type. He had suspected as much even at first, though on some level it surprised him. It had left her speechless, but her body told him not to stop. 'Fuck my ass,' her body always said, to what he knew to be her own great surprise. So Nelson fucked her ass.

""Her name is Mia,"" he said almost conversationally as his large dick slid in and out of the tight asshole. Suzanne's body quivered in response.

""She's married,"" he continued, knowing what his words were doing to her. He told Suzanne about Mia's long legs and her full bush, adding that it reminded him of hers. Then about fucking on Mia's porch, about those legs wrapped around him. He described in detail the filling of the other woman with his cum. It was then, as he had known, that Suzanne's climax came over her, then that that tight ass got indescribably tighter and the moaning lost control and her body spasmed. It was also then that Nelson let his own orgasm happen, and her put all that he had into Suzanne's ass with over twenty loving thrusts.

She went flat on the bed, Nelson with her, his semi-hard dick still in her ass.

""Are you going to fuck her again?"" she asked him. He knew she was conflicted. She wanted this to be the only time, that she would be the one he returned to over and over. At the same time, he knew that she was very turned on by the knowledge of what he did.

""I don't know,"" he told her honestly, ""but I suspect not.""

They lay together for a long time, his dick recovering, getting hard again in her ass like a warm living butt-plug. They spoke quietly in that state. Then they disengaged and showered together and talked some more by candlelight at the kitchen table, this time about things ordinary that made up their everyday lives.

In general, Nelson did not seek out these experiences, which is to say he did not decide that it was time to have sex on his job. He was attractive and understood that he interacted well with both men and women. On the job he was particularly engaging, both professionally and because he liked personal connections. Sometimes, it was a woman who took the initiative. But usually, it was he. He had become very adept at flirtation and opening the door to a woman's interest, yet in a non-committal manner.

He had not always been this way. Nelson's high school experience had consisted of a single sexual encounter. His time at West Point had been so busy that he'd only had a pair of summer relationships, necessarily limited due to the ongoing demands of his enrollment even between academic years. And then as a commissioned officer his profession and regular restationing had limited his relationships. He had preferred connections that would persist for the several months, perhaps even a year or more, before he got orders sending him across the country or overseas. Then he'd resigned his commission and settled down.

And it had begun.

As he had surmised, he never had sex with Mia again. They often had warm discussions when he delivered her mail, and there was a lingering sexual tension that he enjoyed. So did she, he could see. It was probably for the best. While he wouldn't have minded a reprise, perhaps even something regular, it was unlikely to ever be as good as what would then have been their first time. Sometimes you can tell. Nelson admired Mia's judgment.

It was only a month after that encounter on the porch that he developed a rapport with another woman on his route. Another connection with possibilities.

Her name was Abby, and she lived in a large apartment block off downtown that had just gone up a couple years previously. They had never met. One day, he had a parcel too big for the mailbox that needed to be left at her door, so he took the elevator to the third floor, found number 211, and rapped on the door before turning to leave. He hadn't even taken a step before it opened. There was Abby, wearing a formal blue dress.

""Oh!"" she said, surprised. ""I thought you were someone else.""

Nelson was looking at her in the dress. She was amazing. He made sure she could see this in his expression. She blushed.

""I'm a bridesmaid in a wedding next month,"" she explained. ""I just got it yesterday and I'm trying it on. I thought you were my friend, coming over to give me her thoughts.""

Nelson looked down at her exposed calves. Her feet in blue heels. He looked up at her decolletage.

""Wow,"" he said, smiling.

Abby blushed again. She was smiling, too.

And then the elevator pinged down the hall and it was her friend arriving. Nelson said goodbye and took his leave.

For the rest of the day, Abby was on his mind. She was tall and blonde, long-legged and very pretty. Her eyes were striking and her mouth large, alluring. Maybe twenty-five years old, he guessed. She was also getting married, although not until October; he had delivered many returning save-the-date postcards. Her in that dress, her lovely smile, her engagement, her arresting look. She had his attention. He laughed silently to himself, knowing that she certainly was not looking for it. Still.",,2025-08-15T19:01:50.134268,3588,

*****

I kissed Kim on the lips softly. Lightning shot through my body. I held her close to me. These feelings I was having were like nothing else I had ever experienced. They reminded me of the feelings I had with my wife when we first met. Only this was much more intense.

It was December, just after Christmas. The end of the year was coming up quickly and it looked like it was going to be a happy New Year. I had been seeing Kim for a little over a month. What had started out as a way to push my wife into the ultimate submission and humiliation, had turned into something much, much more. I genuinely enjoyed Kim's company. She was funny, smart and arrogant. But also really sweet and kind once you got to know her. In the beginning our relationship was based mostly on Kim's hate for my wife and on sex, but now we had grown past that. We made personal connections that propelled our relationship into an unknown world.

We stood together at the end of the dock, watching the waves roll in under the sunset. I held Kim in my arms and wrapped her protectively with my coat to save her from the winter winds. I could feel her soft, warm body pressed closely to mine. I wanted her. Right then and there. But unfortunately Kim's parents had planned a family getaway for the New Year. Kim needed to go home and get ready to leave.

We walked slowly back to her car. Neither of us seemed ready for the afternoon to end. I was amazed at how amazing she was. It was unfair that one girl should get to possess so many amazing qualities. At her car we kissed again, and then said good bye for the night. I watched as she drove away, and then made my way back to my car.

On the way home I my mind wandered. I couldn't believe how lucky I was. I knew men who would kill to be in the position I was in. I had just spent the day with a beautiful 18 year old girl and now I was going home to my wife, who knew everything and encouraged my affair.

I found Kate at home, right where I told her to be. I had given her very specific instructions for when I was gone. There was a list of things I needed done around the house and there was no doubt that Kate had finished all of them. Obedience was her strength. I had promised Kate that we would play tonight if she got everything done. I had also promised to answer some of her questions about Kim. I just had to be careful not to tell her to much. I didn't want Kate to accidentally figure out who she was until I was ready.

Kate was kneeling in the floor in the middle of the living room, waiting patiently for my return. She was naked except for the chastity belt I had recently locked her in and the pink collar she wore around her neck. Her eyes lit up with excitement when she saw me. I could see a hundred questions building inside of her. As I walked past her into the kitchen I placed my hand on her head and told her that she had done a good job. Then I left her kneeling there while I ate.

I sat alone at the kitchen table and enjoyed the meal that Kate had prepared for me. I thought again at how lucky I was. Once I was finished I picked up Kate's leash from the counter and returned to the living room. Kate was exactly where I had left her. I hooked the leash to her collar and led her to the guest bed room, where Kate had been sleeping. I gestured for her to lie on the bed and she silently obeyed. Once she was comfortable I locked her arms and legs in leather restraints that were anchored to the bed. Once I had her securely locked in place I twisted the key in the lock of her chastity device and released her from it.

Normally I wouldn't go through so much trouble to maintain Kate's chastity. What did I care if she masturbated while I was in the next room fucking some slut? I didn't, but this time was different. Kim was not just ""some slut"" and for this to work I needed Kate to be more submissive, more controlled and more horny than she had ever been in her life. So I stopped having sex with her all together and I stopped allowing her to orgasm. I ran my hands down Kate's naked body, careful to avoid her pussy. Her breath quickened as I touched her and she strained against her restraints.

""So, ""I started. ""What do you want to know.""

""Her name?"" Kate's eyes were closed and her chest rose and fell heavily.

""No."" I told her. ""What else?"" I traced her bare breasts with my fingertips and grazed her hard nipples lightly.

""What does she look like?"" Kate asked. Her face was flushed

""She is beautiful."" I told her. ""She has long blonde hair and beautiful blue eyes. The most beautiful I've ever seen. Her skin is pale and soft and smooth. She has the cutest dimples in her cheeks when she smiles and her smile... her smile is gorgeous. She is about 5'3 , very skinny, very athletic. She carries most of her weight in her ass. Her ass is perfectly round. She has long silky, smooth legs. They feel perfect wrapped around my waist."" I let the last sentence hang in the air. I massaged the inside of Kate's thighs. I ran my hands right up to her pussy and then retreated. Kate was now moaning slightly.

""What do you do together?"" she asked

""Lots of things,"" I told her. ""Today we went to the beach and had lunch by the pier. Then we walked around together for a while. Put our toes in the sand. We talked a lot. We kissed. I held her in my arms. We watched the sun set.""

I graced the outer lips of Kate's vagina with my fingers. It sent shivers through her body. Her pussy was dripping wet. There was a puddle forming beneath her. Kate pushed her hips toward my hand, I moved my hand back away from her. She sighed heavily.

""What else do you want to know?"" I asked her.

""How old is she?"" Kate was straining against her restraints now. Her voice was forced, as if she were out of breath.

""Eighteen,"" I answered. I fet Kate shudder under my hands.

It was an amazing sight to see. I never get tired of getting my wife worked up like this. I couldn't imagine how she could get so turned on my the thought of me being with another woman. I have never seen a woman get a horny as Kate was. She fought hard against the restraints and pushed her self toward me, aching for me to touch her. I finally gave her what she wanted. I slipped a finger into her opening. Kate moaned loudly.

""What was she wearing?"" Kate asked breathlessly.

""A sundress,"" I told her. ""It was pink. It was mid length, coming down about halfway down her thigh. It showed off her ass and legs perfectly. She also wore a pretty high pair of wedges that made her ass looked even better."" I felt for Kate's clit with my index finger. It was extremely engorged. I fingered her softly for a few minutes. Kate's body began to shake. I knew she was about to have an orgasm, so I stopped. She squirmed helplessly on the bed, begging me not to stop. I waited until she calmed down to continue.

""What else do you want to know?"" I asked.

""How many time have you fucked her?""

""Thats none of your business,"" I told her. Kate already had a good idea about how many time Kim and I had had sex. She was usually in the next room when we did it. But it drove her crazy to think that I was fucking her behind her back too. ""What else?""

I answered all of Kate's questions, some of them more than once. She wanted to know how she was in bed, if she was a good kisser, when I would see her again. I told Kate nearly every detail of mine and Kim's relationship. Every time I would answer a question I would play with her clit until she was on the edge of cuming, and then I would stop. I kept Kate on edge for about an hour and a half before I got tired and decided to call it a night. She begged me to let her orgasm but I refused. Tears of frustration and lust rolled down her face as I locked her back inside her chastity belt. I did decide to be nice and let her sleep in the bed with me. I figured since there was no chance of spending the night with Kim it wouldn't hurt.

I spent the rest of the holiday break torturing my wife like this. She spent the day cleaning and cooking while I was at work. When I got home I would play with her until she couldn't take it anymore then I would lock her back up. I had Kate in a constant state of sexual arousal. She was hungry for any sexual contact at all. She practically begged to suck my cock every night. I knew it was getting close to time for her and Kim to come face to face.

https://www.literotica.com/s/my-cheating-husband-ch-02,My Cheating Husband Ch. 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"In the morning, I almost forgot Brad was having an affair. Sleep after an extremely emotionally distressing day is pure bliss until reality hits you like a sack of bricks. Then the memories start to run a train on my brain and feel my gut punched. I just wanted to stay in bed for the rest of the day, but it was Friday, unfortunately. Should I call in sick? No, I should probably save them for an important time where I'm really sick. But who says it's not important now? Ah, whatever, hopefully work will take my mind off of things, get away from this house for a while. Besides, I have the weekend. The whole weekend to be stuck with my cheating husband. Yippee.

I rose from the bed and did my morning routine; weigh myself, shower, facial, make up, dress, have breakfast, pack up lunch. I am 158 lbs, being 5'3"" meant this was no good-this is 20 lbs heavier than my ideal weight. Brad probably likes thinner, curvier women, not chubbies I sulked, submerging myself in the shower. Afterwards, I didn't feel an incentive to make myself up. No amount of foundation, concealer and eyeliner would make me feel sexy, or mask how shitty I feel. Forget even making lunch, I decided. I'm going to punish myself for being so fat my husband has to sex up hotter, skinnier women.

At work, the catty women's group were all huddled to talk about my lack of makeup and gossiped it was ""trouble in paradise."" Despite the stinging in my chest, I maintained a face of stone, just wanting the work day to roll by (as painfully slow as it was). Can't decide on who was more pathetic, these women griping on other women from envy and jealousy, or having an adulterous husband.

On Fridays, Blondie is usually called into the boss's office for a ""weekly meeting"" to assess her performance. She's been here two years, definitely not what I'd call a newbie. Everyone else knows what this means too, even the new guys. In the spur of the moment, I thought about them together. The boss is a well-kept middle aged man. He has voluminous, peppery hair, a square, chiseled jaw covered with a strong, clean cut beard and 'stache, and a seemingly fit body. Must exercise hard on weekends. He also has a wife his age, but obviously dips his dick in girls half his age.

I bit my lip, fantasizing about the boss picking Blondie by her small, princess waist and placing her on his desk. Her short skirt rides up to expose her bare pussy. (Sometimes she gets a little too casual on casual Fridays, and when she bends down, it's hard not to notice). Then, he indulges himself, kissing her pussy and opening her legs more to really taste his forbidden fruit. Blondie hisses at the warm, loving sensation on her vagina, fingers tousling his peppered hair. The boss makes it a point to suck lightly on her clit and she goes a little bit wild, begging to suck his cock again.

""Please, sir, give me your cock,"" she moans. ""I want to taste it again."" Like a good girl she normally is for him, and obliges her. Standing up, he unzips his half-hard cock and she jumps down to get to work. She's crouching on her heels, cunt exposed, passionately loving her married boss's cock. Blondie makes love to him with her mouth, giving more attention to the tip sometimes, or swallowing his whole penis, the whole time fondling his balls. She has no gag reflex, and he's guilty free thrusting into her mouth.

Now at full erection, he roughly brings her up by her hair and pushes her against the desk. She climbs on top and he instantly sinks his cock inside. The warmth wetness squeezing on his thick cock elicits a deep moan while locked lips with her. The boss uses the same hand that has his wedding ring on to grab and fondle Blondie's chest. Eventually, he rips open her shirt and exposes her breast to suck on in a fit of arousal.

At this point, Blondie's pussy tightens around her boss's cock, and bit his neck, avoiding making any noises as she's creaming around him. He hisses from the love bite and pulls her up against him, her slender legs crossed behind him and arms tightly wound on his neck. His cock pops out momentarily, red and wet from their passionate lovemaking, as he moves her back against the wall. Blondie must be in a world of bliss having just cum hard on her married boss's thick cock. He takes his rock hard erection and sinks it into her again. Bracing herself, she loudly moans as he effortlessly pounds into her, more closer than ever. He catches her moans with his mouth. The smell of pussy fuels him to the edge, and announces the build up in his balls are about to explode and lets go of her, cock spasming as she's on her knees now, mouth open and catching the flings of cum. Blondie gives one final suck on her boss's penis, cleaning her vaginal juices so later on his wife can do the same, if she even gave him the pleasure. In a final act of love, they embrace each other after their passionate romp to lazily kiss. At least, that's how I imagined it two hours later when she wobbled out with a different, bigger shirt and hair messier than before.

I decided to take my lunch then and there. It was so uncomfortable walking to my car, panties dripping from arousal. For the big finale, I went home, and parked on the other side of the street again. Sneaking to the backyard again, I try and see if he's there with someone else, but the living room is empty. So, I go back to the front and unlock it, gently pushing myself inside. Just like yesterday, the sounds of sweet moaning and kissing travel from upstairs. So much sex happening in a day.

I'm extra careful slinking my way up the stairs. The door is wide open, and I see Brad's ass facing me. He's on top of this girl, her legs propped up on his shoulders. Frankly, reality and common sense escaped me, and this naughty demon took over my body. I see his cock inching inside and out of her while hearing lips smacking and interrupted moans. Sometimes a squelching can be heard. I had this crazy desire to inch up behind them and see in proximity how deep his cock is in this girl. On all fours, I crawled towards the end of the bed, seeing my husband's 9 inch cock slowly gliding in and out of this random girl's pussy. She moans blissfully, and he grunts in response.

Brad moans, ""God, I love fucking your pussy so much,"" and goes in for another kiss. Despite being incredibly aroused by this, it still hurts.

""Mmm I love your cock,"" she giggles. I hear more lazy, loud pecks. I inch away slowly into the linen closet again, just in time because Brad takes out his cock and cuddles her on the bed, still kissing and making out.

""Fuck, I love kissing you,"" Brad muses and pecks her lips again. ""You're so sexy."" Once again, I feel a pang in my chest, but the arousal is stronger. I hear more moans, but they're louder now. There's a lot of panting, whimpers, and squealing coming from the girl. ""Fuck, yes, ride my fucking cock you slut!"" Brad yelled. I'd never heard this side of Brad before; he was always so sweet and gentle with me in bed as he knew he was my first.

The girl whines, breathlessly repeating, ""Oh! Oh! Oh! Brad! Oh!"" over and over again. I cover my mouth without even noticing my fingers are rubbing against the most erogenous part of me, stimulating more fluid. I hear them finishing. The creaming and cursing and loud grunts send me over the edge and I'm cumming. Inside a linen closet, only a few feet away from my cheating husband. ""Oh, god, Brad, you're so amazing,"" the girl breathes.

""You're even more amazing,"" I hear him say. More kissing. ""You should probably go, though.""

""Scared of being caught?"" she teases.

""Eh, little bit,"" he answers nonchalantly. ""Proud of being my sidepiece?"" he teased back.

She scoffs, ""Maybe. I do like the thought of stealing another woman's man. Makes me feel more confident."" Just another dagger in the heart.

""Pfft, with those knockers and that ass, what man could possibly resist,"" he laughs. More lip smacking. ""Mmm, but you should really go. Don't want my wife finding out.""

The mystery girl sighs, ""Alriiiiight, but I'll miss you!""

""I'll miss you too."" I wait until I see the girl walking out, closing the door behind her, and when my husband closes his. That's when I make it back to work, mind muddled with dirty thoughts. But after the fog clears my mind, I think back to how depraved and pathetic my actions were. I know I needed to stop. I know I needed to do something and get my dignity and self-confidence back. This inhumane desire to watch is tearing the rational side of me apart; and yet, it felt so wrong and taboo to watch. But where should I start? I don't want to tell Brad I know he cheated, he'd furiously deny it-probably lawyer up against my back, kick me out to the curb. All the while 9's and 10's servicing him like I'm not watching.

Fighting fire with fire was out of the question; I'm too meek and moral to go out and cheat on my husband, not that I could, anyway. It wouldn't solve anything, and he'd feel vindicated to hire a lawyer. I don't even want to leave him, I still love him despite everything. My heart still belonged to him. Whether it was naive or not, maybe changing myself for him would work. Maybe if I lose weight he'll only have me, I reasoned. Tomorrow, I determined, I'll join the gym and really take care of my body.

Before I even know it, I'm on my way home. The parking lot is empty, so I come in normally. No candles, or strange moaning. Just Brad in the kitchen, and delicious stew cooking. My tummy rumbles, I haven't eaten all day. My husband perks up when he hears the door closing behind me, and acts even more affectionate towards me. It's still blindsides me; the memories kill my hunger. He wraps his arms around me tightly after he pecks me on the cheek. He smells like his regular manly body wash. ""Oh, babe, I'm so glad you're home,"" he muffled into my neck. ""I missed you so much yesterday, and we really don't get to interact as we used to."" He leans back, warmly smiling at me. It's sickening how I still loved his adorable face. He walks into the kitchen, gesturing to the steam cooker. ""I made dinner for the two of us,"" he announced joyfully.

My stomach genuinely wasn't having it. Despite not eating for the whole day, knowing about his affairs made me lose my appetite. ""Oh, thank you so much dear,"" I giggled forcefully. ""But, I'm not really hungry today.""

My husband stood there quizzically, trying to figure out if I'm joking or not. ""Seriously?"" he asked, not even trying to sound dejected. ""I worked on this for two hours, babe, and you're not even going to have some?""

Thinking back to how everything in my marriage is a lie, my stomach bunched up, and I curled into myself, wincing in pain. I wanted to throw up. ""Sorry, dear, but I'm really not hungry. Maybe tomorrow? I'll eat your stew then"" I lied, climbing up the stairs, all the while needles are painfully stabbing my tummy.

I closed the door, and went to the bathroom to start my shower. The night went on peacefully. Brad came upstairs and spooned with me, holding me close to him, and him whispering, ""I love you."" I pretended I was already sleep.",,2025-08-15T19:02:28.117032,2041,

Chapter Two: Just a Kink

------

With both hands on the steering wheel, Mark took extra care to manoeuvre his way through the last few corners as he made his way back home. Allowing himself a quick glance at the dashboard, he saw the time was 7:57 a.m. But Mark couldn't focus as he knew the clock only told half the story. In truth, it was reckoning time.

His eyes were darting all over the place, tortured by the early brightness of the Sunday morning and the fact that he hadn't slept in almost 24 hours. It didn't take long before Mark's eyes shot a lingering glance to his wrists as he clutched the wheel. Thin, raw, red welts, in almost perfect circles, reminders from squirming in Lana's handcuffs all night. As he pulled into the small car park just outside the window of his and Jess' ground-floor flat, Mark switched the engine off and started to take as many deep breaths as he could, desperate to find the answer...any answer...to this predicament.

Sat perfectly still in the driver's seat, with one hand slackly holding onto the wheel, his heart sank as the reality of the situation made itself clear to him. Was he really the kind of guy to cheat on the woman he loved? The reflection only flooded his mind with fragments of the ecstasy Lana put him through. Fighting the memory, Mark knew what he had to do. He had to tell her...he had to tell Jess. He had to tell her everything...

The sound of the passenger door swinging shut couldn't derail his train of thought. As soon as he told Jess, he would be flushing his relationship down the drain. And it would be all his fault. As Mark made his way inside the apartment building's main door, he walked slowly down the corridor to the front door of his flat and tried the handle. He was surprised to find it was still locked, exactly as he left it when he hurried to Lana's rescue the night before. Mark was sure Jess would've been home by now, even if he'd let her down by not picking her up from Anella's.

Taking a second to dig his keys from his back pocket, Mark unlocked the door and stepped inside, closing the door behind him. There was no sign of Jess in the living room, and a quick dash to the bedroom revealed she wasn't there either. The flat was empty. With his heart pounding, Mark sat on the couch and tried to see how this would all play out. He simply had to tell Jess the truth, but what would happen after that? Surely, inevitably, Jess was going to ask him to leave, no matter how contrite and sincere he would be. With Jess away, Mark reasoned the best thing to do would be to pack a few essentials and stay at his mother's until he worked this all out.

Springing to his feet quickly, Mark went into their bedroom and grabbed his black gym bag. He took a few minutes to stuff some of his work clothes inside, long-sleeved shirts, trousers, underwear and socks. Despairingly, he ran out of space too quickly so went into the closet and stared at his suitcase, but that felt like too much for the moment and rummaged in the closet until he found an old Nike shoulder bag he had from his days at university. The clock ticked by as Mark darted around the flat trying to decide what items he'd need over the next few weeks. After cramming a pair of shoes and trainers into the second bag and struggling to zip it closed, Mark retreated to the living room and sat back on the couch, with the bags sitting on the couch seat to the left of him.

Mark reasoned Jess must have stayed at Anella's and could be home any minute, but he knew he had to wait and tell her about Lana face-to-face. He picked his phone up and thumbed through the menus until he called his mother, but after a number of rings, there was no answer. It was still early on Sunday morning so he decided against calling again and instead sent a quick text, asking his mother to call him when she saw his message. With another anxious glance at his phone, he saw it was 8:45 a.m. The time was flying by. Mark leaned back into the couch and cursed himself for being so fucking selfish.

Stirring from her slumber, Jess was so exhausted that the noise coming from Anella's bedroom was struggling to wake her. But once the clang of Anella's wardrobe door shut for a second time, Jess' eyes shot open and she felt a rush of panic wash over her. Jess sat up, bolt upright, and realised she was on the living room floor. The cold hardwood floor was pressing into her bare cheeks as her mouth hung open and she saw the pink pyjama shorts she slept in lying on the floor next to her. Anxiously, Jess grabbed them as she heard Anella's footsteps on the floor coming towards the door. Jess jumped to her feet and frantically stepped into the shorts, before desperately yanking them up past her knees and into place.

Jess made it with only a few moments to spare before Anella walked into the living room to greet her. Anella took a long stretch with her blonde hair tied into a ponytail and glanced at Jess. ""Hey...did you get some sleep? That couch isn't the best for your back, I don't think..."" As her stretch drew to an end, Anella allowed herself an exaggerated yawn. ""Oh, did Mark get in touch after I went to bed?""

Jess' heart was racing from almost being caught with her pants down on her best friend's floor before the thought brought her to the same panic stations from a moment ago. Her panties, where were they? It was then that she reminded herself of the way she tore them off her hips only a few hours earlier, like she was on heat, and she looked down to scan the floor. It was then that she saw them, little black panties lying in a small heap just next to the couch.

With a nervous glance back to Anella, Jess took a literal hop across to the end of the couch and subtly kicked her panties under the couch and out of sight. ""I...I just woke up the second before you came in, I haven't checked..."" The alarm bells were going off in her head as she tried to work out why she couldn't think of a better answer than kicking her torn underwear under Anella's couch. At that point Jess glanced at the time, it was 8:01 a.m.

It was obvious that both girls were tired as Anella paced across to where Jess stood and reached down to adjust the couch cushions now that Jess had woken up. While she smoothed out the back cushions, Anella couldn't shake the feeling that Jess was so jumpy. What was that little hop she did a moment ago?

""Yeah...I'm sure he's probably called...or at least texted you to let you know where he was. Did you...did you hear anything weird through the night?"" Anella gave the last back cushion a firm slap to restore it to its proper position. ""I don't know what it was, a sound? Some kind of noise?""

With no appetite to get involved in this discussion, Jess reasoned that it was time to just get out of there. With each passing moment that she was awake, she was becoming more familiar with what exactly had happened the night before. Hearing Anella talk about text messages just had her mind swimming with what Lana had sent her. The very thought of what she did on Anella's floor...how many orgasms she had...it was starting to feel like it wasn't a fever dream, it was starting to feel real. ""A sound? Maybe...maybe I heard something from the upstairs flat?"" With that, Jess dashed over to the sofa seat and picked up her jeans before she hurried into the bathroom to get changed.

The change in Jess' demeanour was too much for Anella to overlook, she was just acting so strangely. Anella tilted her head back as she watched Jess dash to the bathroom, knowing that the flat upstairs from her had been empty for the last three months. Raising her voice slightly so it would carry into the bathroom, Anella called. ""So...you're in a real hurry this morning? You don't want to stay and have breakfast? We can stay in or there's a nice place around the corner...""

The words carried to Jess, but she could only pay them a sliver of her attention as she kicked Anella's shorts aside and stepped into her jeans. Jess was only too aware that her panties were missing when she pulled the denim up her thighs and fastened the top button. Jess stepped back into the living room and placed a hand on Anella's shoulder. ""No, no...it's ok. I'm just going to get the train home. I...we can... We can have a nice lunch at work tomorrow if you want?"" Jess put her black shoes on and reached for her coat and bag, putting her arms through the sleeves of the coat and slipping it on.

Anella couldn't work out what was going on, maybe Jess wasn't feeling great? Either way, she knew that Jess was desperate to get out of there, for whatever reason. ""Ok, yeah...that would be nice. As long as you're feeling alright? Jess...you look like you need to get some rest...""

Having gotten the answer she wanted, Jess leaned in and gave her friend a soft, platonic kiss on the cheek before she stepped towards the front door. ""I know...I know...it's...it's ok. I think you're right, maybe a day in bed would be just what I need..."" As Jess opened the front door and stepped outside, she pictured herself lying in bed all day and knew that the last thing she'd give herself was rest. Knowing that she was about a half hour away from her flat, the thought was terribly inconvenient.

Mark was thumbing through his phone as the clock ticked past 9:00 a.m. He was in the middle of considering when his mother would return his call when he heard the front door opening. Sat there, frozen, he looked up and saw Jess as she walked into the living room.

As she entered, she saw Mark sitting there and felt her stomach rise until it was lodged in her throat. For a moment, she couldn't take a breath as she looked him up and down. Her eyes were drawn to the clear and obvious red circles around both wrists. Jess let her eyes flutter and close, but that just let her mind show her the images of Mark lying trapped in those cuffs...with Lana's lips pressing against his...and the same heat started to build between her legs.

Jess knew she had to say something, but had no idea how to conjure the words. It was then that she noticed the two bags sat to Mark's left, swollen to bursting, was he about to tell her that he was leaving? Where was he going to go?

The silence had long since passed the point of awkwardness when Mark stood from the couch and then felt himself sit back down again. He looked to Jess and proceeded with caution. ""Jess...the reason I didn't pick you up last night..."" Mark trailed off then felt himself stand back up again as his heart felt like it was about to stop beating. Parts of him wished it could be that simple as he looked Jess in the eye. ""The reason I didn't pick you up was because I...was with her...""

The theatre of the discussion was almost ludicrous to Jess, she knew exactly where he was last night...and what they were doing. The evidence of which was burning a hole through Jess' pocket as she was fighting the urge to study the footage in the cold, sobering light of day. But Mark's disclosure was tearing her apart. What were his intentions in the first place? How was this all going to play out? Were they going to fuck each other behind her back? Would they have said nothing at all? But then Jess realised, Lana told her everything...even going as far as to send the clips the same night it was happening. And here was Mark about to do the same? Jess felt herself dig her heels into the living room floor and tried to stand her ground against the onslaught of everything coming at her...all at once.

After taking a half step towards her, Mark sensed it wasn't right and then stepped back. Sheepishly, he reasoned he shouldn't be close to her. Not while he risked tearing her apart like this. Despondently, he attempted to clarify. ""Jess...I was with her...I was with Lana..."" With a shameful glance upwards to catch her gaze, he heard himself speaking once more. ""I stayed the night...I stayed the night at Lana's...""

As he saw Jess' lips slowly part, at that moment he'd have done almost anything to stop her from speaking...stop her acknowledgement of his confession from becoming reality. Panicked, Mark's pace became rapid. ""I was here in the flat last night, Jess. I knew that you'd get in touch when you needed a lift home. I was working on my presentation for this week when she...she just...Jess, she said she needed my help...She said she was stuck...she said that her friend couldn't pick her up and she was stranded..."" Mark was staring into Jess' eyes desperate for some kind of non-verbal clue that his words were somehow making the situation better. ""When I got there, everything...everything just got out of hand...Jess, it just got out of control. And it just...it just happened so fast...it was like I was walking into..."" Mark heard himself making excuses and decided to bite the bullet. It wasn't time for anything but the truth, the least Jess deserved was the truth. He loved her; how could he have lost sight of that? ""It's all my fault...Jess, I'm so sorry...I'm just...I'm so sorry...""

Despite her knowledge of the situation, every word of Mark's confession felt like a small surgical blade carving her into pieces. Jess felt her chest rising and falling, at pace, as a slight ringing in her ears started to make itself known. Her boyfriend, the man she loved, cheated on her and she was standing there taking it all in. Whatever high ground Jess imagined she stood atop started to crumble as her mind started to fill in the gaps for her. Only hours ago, on her best friend's floor, she watched Lana slithering up and down Mark's cock for only a few seconds and the sight made her explode, over and over again, until she passed out. All of it was driven by the same thoughts that had plagued her for eight days straight...thoughts of how she manipulated the situation to get Mark to keep in touch with Lana...

Jess felt light-headed as her own truth started to make itself known. From somewhere in her mind, Jess heard Lana's taunts from the night before. That familiar seductive purring reverberated around her skull as Lana goaded her. ""Picturing you just standing there...refusing to stop me...daring me to do it...""

Jess knew that she was part of this too. She pushed her man into a situation that a saint would've struggled with. Jess set Mark on a collision course with the most beautiful seductress she'd ever known, and all because it was getting her so fucking wet. As for the truth? Once it happened and Jess had the clips in her hand...she loved every last second of it...

Sensing Jess was still processing his barrage, Mark felt compelled to slow the pace and seek some form of clarity. ""Jess, I know that you're going to want me to leave and I know...I know...that's what I have to do. I can stay in my old room at my mum's place, and...I guess...""

The moment Mark suggested moving out, both parts of Jess that had been so divided this last week united for the first time. Like her brain had been separated cleanly down the middle, one part rational, one part becoming enslaved by the kink. But Mark's intentions acted like the connective tissue to snap both halves together...at last. Jess felt her fingers closing on each hand, knuckles tight, before finally speaking.

""Stop! Mark...just...stop..."" Even Jess was taken aback by the mental gymnastics she was performing. That she'd been performing for days now. She realised that she was becoming quite adept at it. Mark was more than her boyfriend; he was the love of her life. A future husband that she could start a family with and spend the rest of her life with. There were no conditions where she was remotely interested in breaking up with him. Her mind kept reminding her of her own role in this. Yes, he shouldn't have slept with her...if they even slept at all...but she manipulated him. They're both in the wrong...but he gave her what she craved. He cheated on her, but she used him as a toy and was reckless. She loved Mark and needed him to stay.

Jess looked Mark dead in the eye and addressed him. ""Please...just sit. Just sit down...there are a few things I need to tell you...""

Mark took a step back and sat on the couch. He hadn't had much time since leaving Lana's to predict how this conversation would go, but Jess' behaviour this last week had been catching him off guard.

Jess remained standing and kept Mark's gaze. This was her moment to keep the train on the tracks...at all costs. If he left, there'd be no more relationship...and no way to scratch the itch. ""I haven't been honest with you either...Ever since that night at the bar, I can't really explain what's been going on. It's like...something's come over me...but it's in my head. It's like...imagine a virus in your mind, and no matter what you do...you can't get it out.""

Jess felt the rush of blood to her cheeks as her embarrassment started to peak. ""I need you to know that the very first time I saw you talking to her...at the bar...something went off in my head. Like a spark...like...like a bomb went off...I don't know...I've spent this last week trying so hard to understand..."" Jess moved to Mark's right-hand side and slowly sat down. ""I can't stop thinking about you two...together..."" The confession drew both of Jess' thighs together as her fingers gripped the couch cushion she sat on.

With a hint of trepidation, Mark started to consider Jess' revelation, but couldn't begin to fathom what she meant. ""You mean...were you...you mean you were upset? That...you were jealous I was talking to her?""

Shaking her head slowly, Jess' heart sank when she realised that she'd have to be crystal clear. To remove all ambiguity and help him understand. ""If you can...try to give me a few minutes to attempt to explain..."" Jess cautiously slipped her left hand onto Mark's to try and give herself the strength to continue. ""The first time I saw her...Lana...leaning across the bar at you...and that gorgeous face...and those fucking tits...I don't know why...but...I felt it. I've never felt anything like it in my whole life...""

Mark kept his hand in place, before letting it turn and began softly holding Jess' hand as she spoke. He glanced down at her hand before looking back up and into her eyes.

Buoyed by Mark's touch, Jess kept onwards. ""When I came over to the bar, that bet...everything inside me was telling me...screaming at me...to just tell the truth. But then, whatever this virus is...the feeling just got stronger and stronger...until it felt like it had taken over me."" Jess shifted nervously as she ground her backside into the cushion. ""I was horrified, scared, confused...but when I told Lana that you were just a friend...and she took your number...Mark, I swear...I can't explain why...I was so fucking turned on..."" The disclosure jolted through Jess' body and she clutched tightly onto Mark's hand. ""I could have had the biggest orgasm just standing right there...right in front of her...and it's been over a week and I just...I just can't think about anything else...""

Softly, Mark, open-jawed, rose to his feet and pondered Jess' bombshell, before softly sitting back down. Slowly, the pieces of the jigsaw started to fall into place in his head. ""So...when I came to you and said that we should cut her off...that we should cut ties with her...just ghost her...""

Jess realised where Mark's train of thought was headed and looked away for a moment, before glancing back towards him. ""Babe...it's not that simple. Whatever I've said about her...or what we should do...it's like I'm trapped in my own head. It's just feeding me thoughts and images...it's just taken me over. The power of it, the strength...the weight of it...I just can't act rationally when it to comes to you and her...you and Lana...and the thought of you together...babe, it just gets me so fucking wet...""

After cramming a pair of shoes and trainers into the second bag and struggling to zip it closed, Mark retreated to the living room and sat back on the couch, with the bags sitting on the couch seat to the left of him.

Mark reasoned Jess must have stayed at Anella's and could be home any minute, but he knew he had to wait and tell her about Lana face-to-face. He picked his phone up and thumbed through the menus until he called his mother, but after a number of rings, there was no answer. It was still early on Sunday morning so he decided against calling again and instead sent a quick text, asking his mother to call him when she saw his message. With another anxious glance at his phone, he saw it was 8:45 a.m. The time was flying by. Mark leaned back into the couch and cursed himself for being so fucking selfish.

Stirring from her slumber, Jess was so exhausted that the noise coming from Anella's bedroom was struggling to wake her. But once the clang of Anella's wardrobe door shut for a second time, Jess' eyes shot open and she felt a rush of panic wash over her. Jess sat up, bolt upright, and realised she was on the living room floor. The cold hardwood floor was pressing into her bare cheeks as her mouth hung open and she saw the pink pyjama shorts she slept in lying on the floor next to her. Anxiously, Jess grabbed them as she heard Anella's footsteps on the floor coming towards the door. Jess jumped to her feet and frantically stepped into the shorts, before desperately yanking them up past her knees and into place.

Jess made it with only a few moments to spare before Anella walked into the living room to greet her. Anella took a long stretch with her blonde hair tied into a ponytail and glanced at Jess. ""Hey...did you get some sleep? That couch isn't the best for your back, I don't think..."" As her stretch drew to an end, Anella allowed herself an exaggerated yawn. ""Oh, did Mark get in touch after I went to bed?""

Jess' heart was racing from almost being caught with her pants down on her best friend's floor before the thought brought her to the same panic stations from a moment ago. Her panties, where were they? It was then that she reminded herself of the way she tore them off her hips only a few hours earlier, like she was on heat, and she looked down to scan the floor. It was then that she saw them, little black panties lying in a small heap just next to the couch.

With a nervous glance back to Anella, Jess took a literal hop across to the end of the couch and subtly kicked her panties under the couch and out of sight. ""I...I just woke up the second before you came in, I haven't checked..."" The alarm bells were going off in her head as she tried to work out why she couldn't think of a better answer than kicking her torn underwear under Anella's couch. At that point Jess glanced at the time, it was 8:01 a.m.

It was obvious that both girls were tired as Anella paced across to where Jess stood and reached down to adjust the couch cushions now that Jess had woken up. While she smoothed out the back cushions, Anella couldn't shake the feeling that Jess was so jumpy. What was that little hop she did a moment ago?

""Yeah...I'm sure he's probably called...or at least texted you to let you know where he was. Did you...did you hear anything weird through the night?"" Anella gave the last back cushion a firm slap to restore it to its proper position. ""I don't know what it was, a sound? Some kind of noise?""

With no appetite to get involved in this discussion, Jess reasoned that it was time to just get out of there. With each passing moment that she was awake, she was becoming more familiar with what exactly had happened the night before. Hearing Anella talk about text messages just had her mind swimming with what Lana had sent her. The very thought of what she did on Anella's floor...how many orgasms she had...it was starting to feel like it wasn't a fever dream, it was starting to feel real. ""A sound? Maybe...maybe I heard something from the upstairs flat?"" With that, Jess dashed over to the sofa seat and picked up her jeans before she hurried into the bathroom to get changed.

The change in Jess' demeanour was too much for Anella to overlook, she was just acting so strangely. Anella tilted her head back as she watched Jess dash to the bathroom, knowing that the flat upstairs from her had been empty for the last three months. Raising her voice slightly so it would carry into the bathroom, Anella called. ""So...you're in a real hurry this morning? You don't want to stay and have breakfast? We can stay in or there's a nice place around the corner...""

The words carried to Jess, but she could only pay them a sliver of her attention as she kicked Anella's shorts aside and stepped into her jeans. Jess was only too aware that her panties were missing when she pulled the denim up her thighs and fastened the top button. Jess stepped back into the living room and placed a hand on Anella's shoulder. ""No, no...it's ok. I'm just going to get the train home. I...we can... We can have a nice lunch at work tomorrow if you want?"" Jess put her black shoes on and reached for her coat and bag, putting her arms through the sleeves of the coat and slipping it on.

Anella couldn't work out what was going on, maybe Jess wasn't feeling great? Either way, she knew that Jess was desperate to get out of there, for whatever reason. ""Ok, yeah...that would be nice. As long as you're feeling alright? Jess...you look like you need to get some rest...""

Having gotten the answer she wanted, Jess leaned in and gave her friend a soft, platonic kiss on the cheek before she stepped towards the front door. ""I know...I know...it's...it's ok. I think you're right, maybe a day in bed would be just what I need..."" As Jess opened the front door and stepped outside, she pictured herself lying in bed all day and knew that the last thing she'd give herself was rest. Knowing that she was about a half hour away from her flat, the thought was terribly inconvenient.

Mark was thumbing through his phone as the clock ticked past 9:00 a.m. He was in the middle of considering when his mother would return his call when he heard the front door opening. Sat there, frozen, he looked up and saw Jess as she walked into the living room.

As she entered, she saw Mark sitting there and felt her stomach rise until it was lodged in her throat. For a moment, she couldn't take a breath as she looked him up and down. Her eyes were drawn to the clear and obvious red circles around both wrists. Jess let her eyes flutter and close, but that just let her mind show her the images of Mark lying trapped in those cuffs...with Lana's lips pressing against his...and the same heat started to build between her legs.

Jess knew she had to say something, but had no idea how to conjure the words. It was then that she noticed the two bags sat to Mark's left, swollen to bursting, was he about to tell her that he was leaving? Where was he going to go?

The silence had long since passed the point of awkwardness when Mark stood from the couch and then felt himself sit back down again. He looked to Jess and proceeded with caution. ""Jess...the reason I didn't pick you up last night..."" Mark trailed off then felt himself stand back up again as his heart felt like it was about to stop beating. Parts of him wished it could be that simple as he looked Jess in the eye. ""The reason I didn't pick you up was because I...was with her...""

The theatre of the discussion was almost ludicrous to Jess, she knew exactly where he was last night...and what they were doing. The evidence of which was burning a hole through Jess' pocket as she was fighting the urge to study the footage in the cold, sobering light of day. But Mark's disclosure was tearing her apart. What were his intentions in the first place? How was this all going to play out? Were they going to fuck each other behind her back? Would they have said nothing at all? But then Jess realised, Lana told her everything...even going as far as to send the clips the same night it was happening. And here was Mark about to do the same? Jess felt herself dig her heels into the living room floor and tried to stand her ground against the onslaught of everything coming at her...all at once.

After taking a half step towards her, Mark sensed it wasn't right and then stepped back. Sheepishly, he reasoned he shouldn't be close to her. Not while he risked tearing her apart like this. Despondently, he attempted to clarify. ""Jess...I was with her...I was with Lana..."" With a shameful glance upwards to catch her gaze, he heard himself speaking once more. ""I stayed the night...I stayed the night at Lana's...""

As he saw Jess' lips slowly part, at that moment he'd have done almost anything to stop her from speaking...stop her acknowledgement of his confession from becoming reality. Panicked, Mark's pace became rapid. ""I was here in the flat last night, Jess. I knew that you'd get in touch when you needed a lift home. I was working on my presentation for this week when she...she just...Jess, she said she needed my help...She said she was stuck...she said that her friend couldn't pick her up and she was stranded..."" Mark was staring into Jess' eyes desperate for some kind of non-verbal clue that his words were somehow making the situation better. ""When I got there, everything...everything just got out of hand...Jess, it just got out of control. And it just...it just happened so fast...it was like I was walking into..."" Mark heard himself making excuses and decided to bite the bullet. It wasn't time for anything but the truth, the least Jess deserved was the truth. He loved her; how could he have lost sight of that? ""It's all my fault...Jess, I'm so sorry...I'm just...I'm so sorry...""

Despite her knowledge of the situation, every word of Mark's confession felt like a small surgical blade carving her into pieces. Jess felt her chest rising and falling, at pace, as a slight ringing in her ears started to make itself known. Her boyfriend, the man she loved, cheated on her and she was standing there taking it all in. Whatever high ground Jess imagined she stood atop started to crumble as her mind started to fill in the gaps for her. Only hours ago, on her best friend's floor, she watched Lana slithering up and down Mark's cock for only a few seconds and the sight made her explode, over and over again, until she passed out. All of it was driven by the same thoughts that had plagued her for eight days straight...thoughts of how she manipulated the situation to get Mark to keep in touch with Lana...

Jess felt light-headed as her own truth started to make itself known. From somewhere in her mind, Jess heard Lana's taunts from the night before. That familiar seductive purring reverberated around her skull as Lana goaded her. ""Picturing you just standing there...refusing to stop me...daring me to do it...""

Jess knew that she was part of this too. She pushed her man into a situation that a saint would've struggled with. Jess set Mark on a collision course with the most beautiful seductress she'd ever known, and all because it was getting her so fucking wet. As for the truth? Once it happened and Jess had the clips in her hand...she loved every last second of it...

Sensing Jess was still processing his barrage, Mark felt compelled to slow the pace and seek some form of clarity. ""Jess, I know that you're going to want me to leave and I know...I know...that's what I have to do. I can stay in my old room at my mum's place, and...I guess...""

The moment Mark suggested moving out, both parts of Jess that had been so divided this last week united for the first time. Like her brain had been separated cleanly down the middle, one part rational, one part becoming enslaved by the kink. But Mark's intentions acted like the connective tissue to snap both halves together...at last. Jess felt her fingers closing on each hand, knuckles tight, before finally speaking.

""Stop! Mark...just...stop..."" Even Jess was taken aback by the mental gymnastics she was performing. That she'd been performing for days now. She realised that she was becoming quite adept at it. Mark was more than her boyfriend; he was the love of her life. A future husband that she could start a family with and spend the rest of her life with. There were no conditions where she was remotely interested in breaking up with him. Her mind kept reminding her of her own role in this. Yes, he shouldn't have slept with her...if they even slept at all...but she manipulated him. They're both in the wrong...but he gave her what she craved. He cheated on her, but she used him as a toy and was reckless. She loved Mark and needed him to stay.

Jess looked Mark dead in the eye and addressed him. ""Please...just sit. Just sit down...there are a few things I need to tell you...""

Mark took a step back and sat on the couch. He hadn't had much time since leaving Lana's to predict how this conversation would go, but Jess' behaviour this last week had been catching him off guard.

Jess remained standing and kept Mark's gaze. This was her moment to keep the train on the tracks...at all costs. If he left, there'd be no more relationship...and no way to scratch the itch. ""I haven't been honest with you either...Ever since that night at the bar, I can't really explain what's been going on. It's like...something's come over me...but it's in my head. It's like...imagine a virus in your mind, and no matter what you do...you can't get it out.""

Jess felt the rush of blood to her cheeks as her embarrassment started to peak. ""I need you to know that the very first time I saw you talking to her...at the bar...something went off in my head. Like a spark...like...like a bomb went off...I don't know...I've spent this last week trying so hard to understand..."" Jess moved to Mark's right-hand side and slowly sat down. ""I can't stop thinking about you two...together..."" The confession drew both of Jess' thighs together as her fingers gripped the couch cushion she sat on.

With a hint of trepidation, Mark started to consider Jess' revelation, but couldn't begin to fathom what she meant. ""You mean...were you...you mean you were upset? That...you were jealous I was talking to her?""

Shaking her head slowly, Jess' heart sank when she realised that she'd have to be crystal clear. To remove all ambiguity and help him understand. ""If you can...try to give me a few minutes to attempt to explain..."" Jess cautiously slipped her left hand onto Mark's to try and give herself the strength to continue. ""The first time I saw her...Lana...leaning across the bar at you...and that gorgeous face...and those fucking tits...I don't know why...but...I felt it. I've never felt anything like it in my whole life...""

Mark kept his hand in place, before letting it turn and began softly holding Jess' hand as she spoke. He glanced down at her hand before looking back up and into her eyes.

Buoyed by Mark's touch, Jess kept onwards. ""When I came over to the bar, that bet...everything inside me was telling me...screaming at me...to just tell the truth. But then, whatever this virus is...the feeling just got stronger and stronger...until it felt like it had taken over me."" Jess shifted nervously as she ground her backside into the cushion. ""I was horrified, scared, confused...but when I told Lana that you were just a friend...and she took your number...Mark, I swear...I can't explain why...I was so fucking turned on..."" The disclosure jolted through Jess' body and she clutched tightly onto Mark's hand. ""I could have had the biggest orgasm just standing right there...right in front of her...and it's been over a week and I just...I just can't think about anything else...""

Softly, Mark, open-jawed, rose to his feet and pondered Jess' bombshell, before softly sitting back down. Slowly, the pieces of the jigsaw started to fall into place in his head. ""So...when I came to you and said that we should cut her off...that we should cut ties with her...just ghost her...""

Jess realised where Mark's train of thought was headed and looked away for a moment, before glancing back towards him. ""Babe...it's not that simple. Whatever I've said about her...or what we should do...it's like I'm trapped in my own head. It's just feeding me thoughts and images...it's just taken me over. The power of it, the strength...the weight of it...I just can't act rationally when it to comes to you and her...you and Lana...and the thought of you together...babe, it just gets me so fucking wet...""",,2025-08-15T19:03:08.162152,3595,2.0

""I can't believe you agreed to that punishment for me."" Alexia says to Lucia.

""Agreed to it?"" Lucia says, and then grins. ""It was my idea.""

""You are evil."" Alexia says.

""But you still love me."" Lucia says. ""Besides, it made Robert feel bad for you. If the punishment had been lighter, we might have had to convince him to fully forgive you. Instead, he felt the need to comfort you.""

""True."" Alexia says grudgingly.

""And you did fuck up massively."" Lucia digs a bit, and then adds seriously. ""You could have endangered both of our places here, or risked having us be separated.""

""I don't think they would do that."" Alexia says.

""You didn't think you'd get any punishment at all."" Lucia says. ""I love you, but sometimes you don't think at all.""

Alexia winces a bit, and stays silent for a moment. ""I guess that's fair. I'm sorry.""

""Just don't do anything like that again, please."" Lucia says, hugging her cousin. ""I never want to have to choose between you and them. It's an awful position to be in.""

""I won't. And next time I have a bright idea, I'll come ask if you think it's actually a stupid idea."" Alexia says, snorting as she tries to hold back a laugh.

Lucia laughs too. ""We should get to work. I need to prep lunch for a ton of people, and you've got bed assembly and cleaning to do.""

Meanwhile back at the auction:

Robert and Jane move to the front, just as Trevor and Hannah come back inside from the front desk. Jane waves at them, and they come over, and Hannah sits next to Jane.

""Thank you!"" Hannah says, hugging Jane. ""If you hadn't told him about the claim, I'd still be sitting over there."" She nods towards the back of the room.

""Very welcome."" Jane says. ""When you get home, read everything carefully, including the BAA rules. It sounds like Trevor hasn't been doing his homework.""

""Yeah, homework was never his strong suit."" Hannah says. ""That's not why I'm with him.""

Jane elbows her lightly, and says. ""Good for you."" with a big smile.

Hannah grins, and asks. ""So what's this about the orange auction? They didn't tell us anything, and Trevor is clueless.""

""Do you know Trevor's allotment?"" Jane asks.

Hannah shrugs, and asks Trevor. He shuffles through his paperwork, and Hannah just takes it from him, and shows it to Jane. Jane flips through it quickly, until she thankfully sees Rosie's writing at the top of a page.

""Looks like he is a 2-3 household."" Jane says. ""That means he can have a minimum of 2, and a maximum of 3 concubines. That means you need to pick one or two Orange cards.""

""How do we pick?"" Hannah says.

""Did you happen to make friends with any of them?"" Jane asks. ""Or do you know any of them from before all of this happened?""

""No, I didn't see any of these women until we got here today, and the rest of us red cards were kept to one end."" Hannah says.

Jane sighs, and says. ""I only vetted the three we plan to bid on. I do have a list of people that Lucia thought might be nice, but she's not really basing it on anything. You are welcome to use the list, but I can't guarantee it'll actually be helpful.""

""It's better than nothing."" Hannah says.

""How much money did Trevor bring?"" Jane asks her a bit more quietly.

Hannah elbows him, and whispers the question in his ear. He takes out his wallet and hands it to her. Flipping through it, she finds two twenties and a few dollar bills, along with his debit card.

""Umm... Is there money on that card?"" Jane asks.

Trevor looks like a deer caught in the headlights, before Hannah takes his phone, and opens his banking app. Pointing it at his face, to unlock it, she shows it to Jane.

""$212?"" Jane asks incredulously. Looking at Trevor, she asks. ""How did you plan to buy Hannah? 212 dollars wouldn't have done it.""

""It's all I have."" Trevor says. ""My mom wouldn't lend me money for this.""

""Your mom wouldn't lend you money to save your girlfriend?"" Jane asks with a dangerous tone.

""For the auction."" Trevor attempts to clarify.

""And did she know I was in the auction?"" Hannah asks.

""I'm not sure."" Trevor attempts to deflect the question.

""You mean, no."" Hannah says. ""What the fuck, Trevor? How would you have felt if one of these guys dragged me out of here while you stood there with your thumb in your ass?""

""Bad."" Trevor says. ""It's really all the money I have, and my mom told me to stop asking for money. I guess I didn't think about losing you.""

Hannah is clearly angry, and Jane decides to intervene to prevent a scene, given that the auction was literally starting at that moment. ""I think it's clear you need to take charge when you get home. Sometimes we ladies need to put our foot down and take control of the situation away from these men."" Jane says. ""If you get along with his mom, get her on board with it. He has my number, text or call me if you need help.""

""Thank you."" Hannah says, trying to calm herself. Turning back to Trevor, she says. ""I should make you buy the oldest, ugliest woman up here.""

""That may be all you can afford."" Jane says, not joking. ""With that little money, you should jump on the first woman you see that has no bids, and that you think might work.""

Turning to Robert, she hugs him, and whispers in his ear. ""Thank you for not being a chucklefuck.""

""You are very welcome."" He whispers back, kissing her. ""Now let's watch the auction.""

""First up we have this lovely 28 year old woman. It says here she can cook and clean, and worked at a local diner."" The auctioneer says, talking just fast enough that Robert had trouble following him. ""Who will give me $500?""

No one says anything to the auctioneer, though there is a low hum of conversation as bidders can't manage to shut up. ""Come on now, folks. We are trying to have an auction here. You can talk about the sports scores after the auction. Who will give me $300?""

The auctioneer finally gets a bid at $200, but doesn't manage to get another after that. The next was even worse, a 34 year old mother of 3 who was more than a bit overweight. After initially trying to start the auction at $250, he keeps lowering the price, before declaring the auction to be failed, and calling for the next woman.

""She could work for Trevor."" Jane whispers to Hannah, who snorts.

""That would serve him right."" Hannah whispers back. ""But I do want him to actually be happy, and I don't think she's quite his type.""

As the third woman is led up, Robert says quietly to Jane. ""These prices are really low.""

""They also haven't put up any of the young, attractive girls yet."" Jane says. ""I'm hoping a few of these guys blow their cash on them, before we get to our girls.""

The next few women solicit a similar response, with one not getting any bids. Finally on the sixth woman, the crowd starts paying attention.

""Next up we have a college beauty."" The auctioneer says. ""She's a business major with a 3.8 GPA, is good with kids, and apparently can cook.""

""We don't care if she can cook."" A heckler in the crowd yells. Another one says. ""With tits like that, she'll be too busy to cook in my house.""

""Quiet down there."" The auctioneer says. ""Let's start the bidding at $500.""

The bidding quickly rises, topping out at $800 for a moment, before Frank ups the bid to $1000. He glances around as he does, meeting the other bidders gaze with a bored expression. The man waves at the auctioneer, and Frank wins the girl.

""Was that the one we let him have?"" Robert asks.

""Don't worry about it, honey."" Jane says. ""We don't have enough time to worry about every cute girl here.""

The rest of the auction goes similarly, with low bids for most of the women, with bids getting near $1000 for the beautiful girls. Lindsey is the first of their girls up on the stage. She's crying again, and the crowd seems generally disinterested. Robert tries to bid when it opens at $400, but Jane squeezes his leg to stop him. ""Wait, let other people bid, and then only bid when you think it's done.""

Robert waits impatiently as the bid drops to $300, and then $250, he looks over at Jane, who still shakes her head. Eventually someone bids at $150, and Jane whispers. ""Wait."" After a moment asking for $175, there appear to be no more bids. ""Go for $200."" Jane says.

Robert does, and the other guy drops out. ""1 down, and 5 to go."" Jane whispers.

A few women later one comes up that was on Lucia's list. The bidding starts at $400, but quickly drops to $100. Jane leans over to Hannah as the initial price fails. ""This is one of the ones that Lucia liked."" Pulling up her notes, she reads off the basic info, which is that she is 22, works at a daycare, and likes kids.

Hannah nods, and nudges Trevor. ""Do you like her?""

""I like you."" Trevor says.

""We don't have time for that."" Hannah says. ""If you like her, bid $100 now.""

Trevor freezes a second, and the bid drops to $75. Hannah growls in frustration, reaching over and raising his hand for him. He looks at her, and she says. ""Don't do that. I can tell you like her, so bid on her. Don't go over $125, we need money to live.""

The bid is raised once to $100, and Trevor manages to bid for himself at $125, securing the sale.

""Good job."" Jane tells Hannah. ""You are learning.""

Next up is Taylor. She thankfully avoids most of the catcalls from the crowd, but the bidding is a bit more brisk. Robert is getting antsy at $750, and when Frank catches Jane's eye as if to ask if they are bidding, Jane tells Robert to do $900. Frank gets the hint and backs off, and they manage to get her at $1100.

Frank snaps up the next woman, only paying $350 this time. After a few more women, it was Emily's turn. Her large glasses and shy manner seem to help keep the crowd less interested than in most auctions, and Robert manages to get her for $500.

After another dozen women, Dee comes up. ""Here we have a very spirited 28 year old. I understand she is good at cleaning, and you would never be bored.""

Dee screams, and tries to thrash as two guards carry her chair onto the stage, Dee still attached to it.

""Fuck you."" She screams at the crowd, and a few of the men get into it, yelling back.

The auctioneer senses some interest, and decides to start the bidding low, hoping to secure any sale. At $50 he gets a bit of action, and the numbers actually go up to $100 quickly. Unfortunately she spots Jane and Robert at this point, and starts screaming. ""Bid on me, bitch!""

Robert puts his arm around her, and whispers. ""Why don't you step out for a few minutes?""

Jane just stares back at Dee, not moving. ""I need to stay."" She tells Robert. ""She doesn't care about me at all, she just wants to use me again.""

""Bingo."" He says. ""She's been using us since day one.""

The bidding eventually stops at $150, and she appears to have been won by a rough looking middle aged redneck.

She gives one last ""Fuck you!"" As the guards pick up her chair and carry her out of the room. As she leaves, Robert hugs Jane closely and asks. ""Are you ok?""

""Yeah."" Jane says. ""I think I am.""

There are only a few orange cards left, and while they all sell, the bids are very low. After the last goes up, the auctioneer goes to confer with a few officials at the side of the room. When he comes back, he says. ""We still have nearly two dozen women who did not sell. Anyone who purchased two orange cards, you are now free to go. If you plan to participate in our small red card auction, feel free to remain in the front waiting area, and you will be called back shortly. If you don't plan to participate in that auction, please visit the front desk as soon as you exit to get your concubines registered, and to pay. Your slaves will be brought out after payment is received.""

""Those of you who did not purchase two concubines, please remain behind."" The man says.

Hannah looks at Jane, and asks. ""What do we do?""

""They may want you to take one more. If they do, try to get out of it."" Jane suggests. ""Tell them that he lives with his mother, and can't support 3 women. If that doesn't work, try to get the best woman you can. He has my number if you need to call or text me.""

Robert and Jane head back to the waiting room, and sit in the far corner, away from the crowd that is piled up around the front desk.

""It may just be us for the red card auction."" Frank says as he sits down next to them. ""I almost bid on your vet, I'm glad you bid when you did, or I'd have raised the price quite a bit.""

""We are bidding on these three for the next auction."" Jane says, and gives him the profile numbers. ""This one I care less about, if you really want her.""

""Nope, not interested in that one."" Frank says. ""I don't want to fill my house in one night anyhow, and I'm already taking home 7 today.""

""Why not that one?"" Robert asks. ""If you know something we don't, feel free to share it.""

""Just a feeling."" Frank says. ""She's not my type anyhow.""

""What is your type?"" Jane asks curiously.

""Pretty and docile."" Frank says. ""I plan for my retirement to be boring and happy. That girl seems like trouble to me.""

Jane sighs. ""Me too, honestly. We requested her to be put in the auction though, so we have to bid at least once if no one else does.""

Frank looks around. ""We may all be getting very good deals. I see one guy over there, and maybe one of the poors who didn't bother to bid in the first round will stick around, but this auction certainly seems like it'll be small.""

Jane's phone buzzes. ""It's Hannah."" she says.

""Is that the black girl that was sitting next to you?"" Frank asked. ""With the chest.""

""Yeah..."" Jane says, taken aback by the man's crudity. ""You know all women have those, right?""

""Not like she does."" Frank says. ""I am jealous of that boy, I thought about bringing her home when I spotted her.""

""If it makes you feel any better, that's her boyfriend."" Jane says. ""And we would have bid against you.""

""Oh well."" Frank says. ""Plenty more of these auctions, and the girls I've gotten so far should be very sweet.""

""What did Hannah say?"" Robert asks.

""They are asking everyone for their ID cards to scan, and now the auction guys are talking."" Jane says. ""She thinks they are deciding who has to take the women that are leftover.""

A moment later Hannah and Trevor come through the waiting room doors. Hannah comes over to Jane, and hugs her. ""We got out without taking anyone else."" Hannah explains. ""It sounds like they are going to do a second auction of the orange card women. They were telling each card holder how many of them he had to take, and apparently if they don't bid on that amount, they are getting assigned them.""

""I'm glad you got out of it."" Jane tells Hannah. ""Two of you will be plenty while you are still living with Trevor's mom.""

""Speaking of which..."" Hannah looks at Trevor. ""Are we just showing up at your house, or do you want to call her?""

""Shit."" Trevor says. ""Showing up. It's harder for her to kick us out if we are already inside.""

""Remember to tell her you are legally required to take the woman you purchased."" Jane says. ""And you rescued Hannah, even if you almost fucked that up. Maybe don't tell her that part.""

""I'm definitely telling her that part."" Hannah says.

""Please don't."" Trevor says. ""Please.""

""We can talk about it on the ride home."" Hannah tells him. ""Now go get in line to pay, so we can get out of here.""

Jane and Hannah chit chat while they wait, while Frank eyes up Hannah's sizable chest out of the corner of his eye while pretending to be doing something on his phone.

Robert just sighs, and texts Lucia to give her an update, and to let her know to plan for 6 extra women for dinner. He also warns her about Reyna, and she just sends back an eggplant emoji, and a thumbs up. ""Damn kids."" Robert grumbles, and Jane looks over and laughs.

A few minutes later a large group of disgruntled men comes out of the hall door, marking the end of the second orange card auction. A moment later one of the men with the auctioneer comes in, and tells bidders for the red card auction to come in. ""Go stand with Trevor."" Jane tells Hannah. ""Trust me, you don't want to be out without your owner or a handler.""

Jane walks her over to Trevor, who is nearly at the front of the line, and then walks back into the back room with Robert.

""Frank was definitely right."" Jane says. There are 4 other people sitting in the seats, one of whom had apparently stayed back during the last auction. Robert and Jane take a seat towards the middle, and Frank joins them a minute later.

""Well, it's not just us, but I still think we are fine."" Frank says.

The auctioneer takes the stage, and says. ""Hello all. This auction is a little different. Each of these girls was requested by someone in this room in particular. Keep in mind if you did request the girl, you must bid at least once. If you didn't, you might piss someone off by bidding on their sweetheart. Fist fights can happen afterwards in the parking lot though. If everyone's ready, let's get this moving, I'm ready for lunch.""

As they call up the first girl, Robert says. ""We requested the Indian nurse, and creative chick. I'll bid the open on them, and then they are all yours.""

""Fine by me, but just the one bid."" Frank says. ""I requested your Asian girl as well, so I'll do the same thing.""

The first two girls that are called up aren't any of theirs, and the third is one of Frank's, who he snags for the opening bid. The opening bids on these are higher, all starting at at least $500, because they have a buyer who is required to bid.

The fourth is Reyna. Robert starts the bidding at $750 as he is required to, and it quickly becomes apparent that a few of the other men are also interested in her. The bidding quickly reaches $1500, and Robert tries to stop the momentum by bidding $2000. One of the seemingly poor men must be using his life savings for this, because he bumps it to $2500. Robert looks at Jane, and she nods and says. ""Keep going. We barely spent anything in the first auction."" Robert bids $3000, and then man counters at $3500.

""5000"" Jane says, raising Robert's hand, and glaring at the other bidder. He looks upset, but doesn't bid any more.

""Sold"" Says the auctioneer, and Reyna is lead off to the side.

""Your lady means business."" Frank says. ""Reminds me of my wife, God rest her soul.""

Frank snags the Indian nurse a few women later, but has to pay $2000 for her, and as he does, he tells Robert. ""I'm noticing a pattern here. The more exotic, the higher the price.""

""Yeah, I noticed that too."" Robert says. ""I get the feeling Mei is going to cost me an arm and a leg.""

""Probably."" Frank says. ""My budget for her was going to be 10k, but we made a deal, so I'll stay out of it.""

The artisan goes soon after for $1500 to Frank, and he says. ""That's about it for me, unless one of these others are cheap.""

Megan is up next, and Robert opens the bidding at $500. Despite, or perhaps because of, being a well built blonde girl, she attracted relatively little attention. Robert manages to get her for just $800.

The next few girls do go cheap, but not cheap enough for Frank. He bids once, but doesn't win. Robert looks at him questioningly, and he says. ""That asshole bid up my Indian nurse. I just wanted to repay the favor.""

Finally Mei comes around, the very last woman up for bid. ""We've saved the best for last her folks."" The auctioneer says, waving Mei onto the stage. ""This young lady was requested by three of you. She's half Chinese, and I understand she used to be a cook at her grandparent's restaurant. Who could turn down a beautiful, exotic girl who can cook? Let's start the bidding at $2000.""

Frank immediately met the minimum bid, and then folds his hands in his lap. The same man that was bidding on Reyna raises the bid to $3000 immediately.

""$5000."" Jane says, ""and if he raises it again, $10000. We need to show him we aren't fucking around.""",,2025-08-15T19:03:39.887025,3697,
https://www.literotica.com/s/tanyas-wish-list-pt-02-dark-day,Tanya's Wish List Pt. 02 - Dark Day,Unknown Author,,,,,"There is a theme of dominance and submission throughout this story, as well as ENF, CMNF and partner sharing. Submitted under BDSM, but could fit in other categories too.

***

The man in black advanced on her menacingly, brandishing a red hot poker. The woman desperately tried to pull away, anything to escape the unspeakable agony that was coming. Held firmly by two thugs, she could only beg piteously. ""Wait, wait -- I can be reasonable!""

""That time is past.""

""I'll tell you everything!""

An evil smile crossed his face as he held the hellish instrument an inch from her cheek. ""Yes, I know you will.""

That, of course, is a scene from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I've always remembered it with morbid fascination. The woman, pathetic in her helplessness. Terrified, reduced to animal fight or flight instincts. But my enduring memory was the expression on the face of the ruthless man who was about to put her to torture. Sure, he needed information, but he also wanted to do it to her. He relished it. It took me years to understand that I wanted to see that same look on the face of my lover.

I knew I would have to explain it to Michael, and the details of what I envisioned would be a long conversation. But what I had put down as second on my wish list of terrible things was simply, ""A Dark Day.""

The scene Michael had engineered with his friends had been intense. Troy's participation was especially humiliating for me, along with the fact that there were photos and videos being shared among people of Michael's choosing. It's a sublime thing, having to act normal around people at a restaurant or gathering of friends, knowing that some of them have seen you being sexual and degraded. Although we are extremely sex positive, I liked playing with the idea that I should be punished for being a slut with Michael's friends.

Over several nights we discussed how I envisioned my ""Dark Day"", and Michael had me write out more details. I imagined a full day where Michael did his absolute worst. No holding back, no going easy on me. Hardcore from the first moment. There were a few specific things I wanted to happen.

First, I didn't want to know when it was coming. I wanted us to live our normal lives, maybe even have a nice companionable day before. But on the Dark Day I wanted Michael to abruptly shake me awake and literally kick me out of bed. Then when all I want is love and tenderness, he should give me a merciless beating. That was the start, there would be a few other scenes I described and Michael was free to plan the rest. The main thing was I wanted it to be completely authentic. I was curious to see how real it could get, and I wanted only a tiny part of my brain to know I was safe. Michael could be as sadistic as he liked -- the more cartoonishly evil, the better. And I wanted him to be as convincing as possible. I needed him to make me truly scared and allow me to access the deepest depths of my submissiveness.

As always, Michael prepared carefully and thoroughly. Not that I knew this at the time, but I sensed it was in the works. As any submissive will tell you, the anticipation is a big part of the fun. Although I'm not sure 'fun' is the right word here. I was actually scared. In our discussions Michael and I had uncovered the idea that I wanted to feel at risk both physically and emotionally. I don't think many kinky people play with emotional sadism. God knows there's too much of that happening in real life. But the love between us made me feel it was possible to safely explore this area. I trusted Michael absolutely, and I felt there could be rewards for going down this dangerous road.

Physical domination is usually the first thing that comes to mind when we think about sexual submission. But power exchange is another big part, and often the main focus for some people. What greater power could Michael have over me than leveraging my love for him? I imagined him threatening me subtly, implying that he might like me less if I didn't perform as directed. Or that his eye might wander toward another girl if I wasn't sufficiently entertaining. The thought made me shiver.

This is not for everyone. I hadn't been sure it was for me, but we decided our relationship could allow this sort of play. Having agreed on that point, I locked away all feelings of safety and security in a corner of my mind. Now I wanted to experience the growing fear as I waited for my Dark Day.

***

Just like the time I went skydiving, I knew what was going to happen, I knew what to expect and it still scared me senseless. Michael faked me out by choosing a weekday. It was a Friday morning, and I was scheduled to work. So when my butt hit the carpet I was so stunned I forgot about the whole thing and just gaped up at him in confusion.

He barked, ""Stand up and bend over the dresser.""

Michael had shoved me out of bed and I was rubbing my ass, still bewildered at what was happening.

""Up! Bend over the dresser! Now!""

It all came back to me. My heart thumped. It was happening today? Now?!

He was not going to be patient. Michael seized me by the hair, hauled me to the dresser and threw me over it. I was suddenly aware that I was naked while Michael was already dressed. I reached up to brush hair from my face, but he was faster and slammed my hands flat on the dresser. Then the belt, which I heard before I felt it. The pain was so sudden and intense my knees buckled.

""Stand up!""

I immediately straightened, and with no respite the belt landed on my ass again with a loud crack. I fell again, knowing I couldn't take this. I had been conscious for less than a minute and I was already failing. Michael yanked me by the hair, bringing my ear to his mouth.

""Stand up and present that ass. If I have to wait again, I am fucking DONE with you!""

""What???""

""I am going to beat your ass, and if you can't take it I am walking out that door. So long, goodbye...""

Utterly panicked, I assumed the position and begged. ""No! No, I'll take it! Beat me! Beat me until your arm is tired! Don't go!"" I tried to entice him by arching my back and wiggling my ass. I was shocked by the nuclear level of his threat, and it never occurred to me to disbelieve it. Normally, I want to make Michael proud of me. Now I was in survival mode, desperate just to keep him from abandoning me. I had been asleep less than three minutes before.

""Eyes forward, hands flat,"" he said menacingly.

""Yes, sir,"" I said, trying to placate him with complete obedience.

The belt. Hard and merciless. Michael wasn't playing, he was giving me a serious beating. I kept still and cried. I cried hard, from pain, shame and betrayal. But I absolutely could not move or defend myself. I couldn't risk his abandonment. So the belt crashed into my ass over and over, much faster and harder than any recreational scene. Michael read my thoughts.

""You wanted serious, you got it,"" he said beginning and ending the sentence with vicious belt strikes. A few more and then a pause. ""Look at me.""

I warily turned my head. Michael glared at me with contempt, the belt raised. ""Ask me for more."" Tears still flowing, I tried to focus on his face. He lowered the belt. ""Unless you want me to leave?""

""No! No!"" I cried pathetically. Chest heaving, I caved. ""Please... beat me.""

""Not very convincing."" His disappointment was soul crushing.

I gritted my teeth and steeled myself. ""Beat my ass! Take it all out on me -- I'll bear it for you!""

Michael smiled, which briefly warmed my heart. Then it turned evil, and with a sneer he raised the belt and delivered a tremendous blow. It was terrible to see it coming, and the pain was so intense it made me dizzy. But he hadn't told me to look away, so I kept eye contact with him as he rained hell on my proffered ass. It was just like the movie. He was enjoying putting me to torture.

It went on for I don't know how long. Probably just minutes, but to me it was endless. Michael was actually exerting himself, while I was covered in sweat (and angry red stripes). Delivering a final belt strike, he put his hands on his knees and rested. I felt like I had run a marathon, and endured a Roman scourging. But no rest for me. Michael hauled me up by my hair again. ""Bring me a towel and a warm washcloth."" When I hesitated, he snapped, ""Now!"" and I jumped to it.

Scurrying back, I found Michael sitting on the bed. He mopped his brow, toweled off and ordered me to rub down his arm and shoulders. I gingerly joined him on the bed, kneeling because there was no way I could sit after the belt, and began tending to him.

Ever have a moment where you see yourself from the outside? I realized incredulously I was comforting a man who was tired out from beating me, massaging the arm that was sore from swinging the belt. And I fucking loved it. My love and admiration for Michael filled my heart at this moment. He was an artist, and his medium was evil.

I desperately wanted to kiss him and receive tenderness in return, but I didn't dare. Instead I concentrated on kneading his muscles, hoping it would make things easier on me going forward. Having caught his breath, Michael stood and took me by the elbow. Brooking no nonsense, he propelled me toward the kitchen. ""Make me breakfast. Good little sluts make eggs in the morning.""

""Yes, Michael."" I hurried to get to work. Naked in the kitchen, making eggs. Eager to please the man who had just taken a belt to my ass. I would have laughed if it weren't for the painful, angry welts.

Michael watched as I gathered ingredients. ""You'll only need about half of that. You're not eating."" I quickly returned some food to the fridge. When I started on the bacon Michael tossed me an apron. My appreciation quickly turned to self-consciousness because Michael began taking photos. It was a tiny apron, and it made me feel more exposed than simply being naked.

While the bacon sizzled he had me look into the camera for a brief video. After panning up and down my body, he asked what I was doing. The kind of answer he wanted was obvious. I stared soulfully into the lens and said, ""Michael just beat me with a belt, and now I'm making him breakfast.""

""How come?""

I swallowed my pride and answered, ""Because I'm a good little slut."" He made a point of showing me that he was sending it to some of our friends.

The bacon smelled wonderful, but none for me. I served Michael at the table and he pointed to a spot next to him. I knelt on the hard floor while he ate. You may be thinking at this point in the story that this doesn't sound like much fun for me. I suppose there's some truth to that, insofar as it's not exactly ""fun"" in the moment. But it was deeply satisfying, and I loved it. Michael understands there is a difference between being dominant and simply being a jerk. It was all calculated. He was working hard to make me feel debased and make me believe (except for that tiny part of my mind that knew I was safe) that I wasn't pleasing him and was in danger of being tossed away. The reward would come much, much later, when he told me that I really was a good girl. That was what I yearned for more than anything -- being Michael's Good Girl.

That said, I was really hungry. I didn't think I had much room to cajole Michael, but my hunger and the smell of bacon was making a good argument to try. I put a hand on his thigh and looked up at him with big, hopeful eyes. Michael regarded me incredulously. ""What are you, a cocker spaniel?""

I decided to push my luck. ""Can I please have a little piece of bacon? Just a mouthful? I've been good, haven't I?""

Michael slowly turned his head to look at me, and I realized I had made a mistake. He put down his fork, pushed back his chair slightly... and slapped me across the face.

I crumpled in shock. My cheek was on fire, my ass hurt from the belt and I thought I might have an orgasm right there. Though we had discussed it, Michael had been reluctant to introduce this sort of play. I tried to convince him that it wasn't much different than spanking because I was really curious how I would react. Now I knew. Cowering on the floor, wondering if he would strike me again, I felt so in love I would have agreed to have babies.

Now he stared down at me and growled, ""You'll eat something soon enough. Give me that apron.""

I divested myself and was once again naked, not daring to move from my knees. Michael seized my hair and put my face next to his plate. ""Stay still."" He proceeded to finish his breakfast with my nose an inch from his food. At this point I wouldn't have tried to take a morsel on a bet.

Michael pushed back from the table. ""Put it in the sink, you can clean up later."" I hurried to comply. As I turned back from the sink he was already there and took hold of my hair again. Forced to my knees, I was made to take out his cock and it was immediately thrust to the back of my throat. Maybe it was better that I hadn't eaten.

Most of the time Michael lets me worship his cock at my leisure, which I adore. Long, slow blowjobs with lots of eye contact. When I feel like highlighting my submissiveness I'll take his hand and put it on the back of my head, or rub his cock lovingly on my face. Today was different. He was going to take his pleasure how he wanted, at his pace.

Still holding me tightly, Michael put me in my place both physically and verbally. He told me I was getting not just what I had asked for, but what I deserved. If I wanted to be the lowest form of slut for a day, no problem. I would be used at his whim, and perhaps by others, and I had best shut up and take it. He demanded a response and I nodded pitifully, my mouth full of his cock.

""Oh, and you were hungry. We can fix that."" Michael hauled me to my feet and dragged me toward the bedroom. Strange to think of it at that moment, but I actually mused that my day had only just begun.

Michael sent me sprawling onto the bed. He was tossing his pants aside and I began to beg him to be gentler, but he showed me the back of his raised hand. That threat made me cower again and I resolved to just quietly endure whatever was coming. He climbed onto the bed and gave me a dismissive push on my shoulder, putting me on my back.

Looming over me, Michael stared into my eyes with menace. Slowly, he snarled, ""Cross your wrists over your head, spread your legs... and SHUT UP."" I assumed the position, knowing I was about to be used very roughly. But I had been totally wet and ready from the moment he had slapped me, so I welcomed it.

We often have vigorous sex that makes me feel taken and submissive. But this was something else altogether. Michael lunged into me and it was off to the races. My ass hurt as it rubbed against the sheets and I knew my insides would quickly become sore from this kind of intercourse. But my immediate worry was how not to orgasm without permission. I was out of my mind aroused, and surely Michael could feel it in my extreme wetness.

I need not have worried. As my situation grew dire Michael suddenly stopped with just the tip of his cock inside me. ""Don't you make a fucking sound,"" Michael growled. ""I know when you're about to cum, and it's not going to happen.""

He did know me that well. In a moment he began thrusting again and continued talking, whispering degradation in my ear. ""You love this, don't you? On your back, putting out for me, your slutty pussy getting used.""

I nodded feebly and agreed, far off into sub-space.

Sensing I was close to going over the edge again, Michael paused. Normally I could plead with him for an orgasm (usually denied), but that was definitely off the table during my Dark Day. He soon resumed taking his pleasure. I had sagged a bit from exhaustion and soreness, prompting him to admonish me. ""Keep your legs spread!"" I put my knees up and spread wide, relishing the dirty feeling of doing as I was told.

Getting back into his rhythm, Michael now enlisted me in degrading myself. He directed me to call myself names, to admit my true nature. We had done this a couple of times before, but now it took on an even bigger power.

""What's happening to you right now?"" Michael prompted.

""You're fucking me like a slut!""

""You deserve this -- tell me you deserve this.""

""I do deserve it!"" I gushed. ""This is how little sluts should get used!""

""You like it this way, don't you?""

""Yes! It's your right to use me like a whore! Whenever you want! You own me!""

Michael began grunting in my ear. ""I'm going to cum! I'm going cum in that little pussy!""

Ecstatic, I urged him on. ""Yes! Do it! Fuck your slutty girl! Fill me up!""

Looping his hands under my shoulders, Michael lunged hard. It hurt and I had to force myself to keep from crying out while he emptied his balls into me, using my pussy for its intended purpose. He heaved over and over, milking out every bit of his orgasm while I waited for him to finish. I made sure to keep my legs spread wide and to not distract from his pleasure. I soon felt Michael's weight on my chest as he panted and rested. I felt beaten on the inside and out, but also very proud of myself. However, there was no after-care in my future. This was my Dark Day.

I started to thank Michael, as I always did after sex (I think it's only right for a good submissive to say 'thank you' for being used), but the steely gaze had returned. ""Quiet.""

I shut up and waited. Michael grabbed his camera from the bedside and sat up at the foot of the bed. I saw the red light wink on. ""You said you were hungry. I just gave you something to eat.""

My mouth hung open in astonishment as I realized what he wanted. I wasn't shocked that I had to eat cum from my own pussy, despite it being as nasty an act as I could imagine. But rather that he was going to record it. Friends would no doubt see me in this moment of unspeakable wantonness. My emotions whirled and then settled not just on acceptance, but eagerness. Michael had outdone himself again, and I was going to gladly participate in this humiliation.

""What just happened?"" Michael asked, surely for the benefit of future viewers.

Shyly but clearly I answered, ""You just came inside my pussy.""

He gave me a nod that was clearly an order. I reached down and slid two fingers inside myself, finding a swampy mess. I scooped out what I could and quickly brought it to my mouth where I made a show of savoring it. Then I went back for more, and did it again three times. After the last taste I licked my fingers while staring into the lens, then leaned over and took Michael's cock into my mouth for cleaning. He looked momentarily surprised, but quickly recovered. ""Good little slut,"" he said before turning off the camera.

Michael put me to work with household chores while he relaxed. But first he had me set a ten-minute timer on my phone, which I left on the end table next to him. I was vacuuming when it went off and Michael called me over. He was all business. ""On your knees, hands at your sides. I'm going to hurt your nipples.""

When I hesitated, Michael slapped my face again. I whipped back around and looked at him accusingly, truly shocked. He raised his hand again. ""Want another?""

Actually, I kind of did. But I felt it would be unwise to poke the bear. So I quickly went to my knees and prepared myself. I endure a lot of rough nipple play. But like everything else today, I sensed we would be going to unexplored places. He reset the timer to thirty seconds, showing me before placing the phone on the floor at my knees. ""After I start, you can press start on the timer. Then your hands go behind your back and stay there. Ready?""

I had questions. Perhaps there were ways I could exploit the rules to my advanta... No! Michael seized my nipples and the pain immediately went to 11. No ramping up, no giving me time to adjust. I cried out and my body twisted. ""Stay still!"" Michael admonished.

""Not very convincing."" His disappointment was soul crushing.

I gritted my teeth and steeled myself. ""Beat my ass! Take it all out on me -- I'll bear it for you!""

Michael smiled, which briefly warmed my heart. Then it turned evil, and with a sneer he raised the belt and delivered a tremendous blow. It was terrible to see it coming, and the pain was so intense it made me dizzy. But he hadn't told me to look away, so I kept eye contact with him as he rained hell on my proffered ass. It was just like the movie. He was enjoying putting me to torture.

It went on for I don't know how long. Probably just minutes, but to me it was endless. Michael was actually exerting himself, while I was covered in sweat (and angry red stripes). Delivering a final belt strike, he put his hands on his knees and rested. I felt like I had run a marathon, and endured a Roman scourging. But no rest for me. Michael hauled me up by my hair again. ""Bring me a towel and a warm washcloth."" When I hesitated, he snapped, ""Now!"" and I jumped to it.

Scurrying back, I found Michael sitting on the bed. He mopped his brow, toweled off and ordered me to rub down his arm and shoulders. I gingerly joined him on the bed, kneeling because there was no way I could sit after the belt, and began tending to him.

Ever have a moment where you see yourself from the outside? I realized incredulously I was comforting a man who was tired out from beating me, massaging the arm that was sore from swinging the belt. And I fucking loved it. My love and admiration for Michael filled my heart at this moment. He was an artist, and his medium was evil.

I desperately wanted to kiss him and receive tenderness in return, but I didn't dare. Instead I concentrated on kneading his muscles, hoping it would make things easier on me going forward. Having caught his breath, Michael stood and took me by the elbow. Brooking no nonsense, he propelled me toward the kitchen. ""Make me breakfast. Good little sluts make eggs in the morning.""

""Yes, Michael."" I hurried to get to work. Naked in the kitchen, making eggs. Eager to please the man who had just taken a belt to my ass. I would have laughed if it weren't for the painful, angry welts.

Michael watched as I gathered ingredients. ""You'll only need about half of that. You're not eating."" I quickly returned some food to the fridge. When I started on the bacon Michael tossed me an apron. My appreciation quickly turned to self-consciousness because Michael began taking photos. It was a tiny apron, and it made me feel more exposed than simply being naked.

While the bacon sizzled he had me look into the camera for a brief video. After panning up and down my body, he asked what I was doing. The kind of answer he wanted was obvious. I stared soulfully into the lens and said, ""Michael just beat me with a belt, and now I'm making him breakfast.""

""How come?""

I swallowed my pride and answered, ""Because I'm a good little slut."" He made a point of showing me that he was sending it to some of our friends.

The bacon smelled wonderful, but none for me. I served Michael at the table and he pointed to a spot next to him. I knelt on the hard floor while he ate. You may be thinking at this point in the story that this doesn't sound like much fun for me. I suppose there's some truth to that, insofar as it's not exactly ""fun"" in the moment. But it was deeply satisfying, and I loved it. Michael understands there is a difference between being dominant and simply being a jerk. It was all calculated. He was working hard to make me feel debased and make me believe (except for that tiny part of my mind that knew I was safe) that I wasn't pleasing him and was in danger of being tossed away. The reward would come much, much later, when he told me that I really was a good girl. That was what I yearned for more than anything -- being Michael's Good Girl.

That said, I was really hungry. I didn't think I had much room to cajole Michael, but my hunger and the smell of bacon was making a good argument to try. I put a hand on his thigh and looked up at him with big, hopeful eyes. Michael regarded me incredulously. ""What are you, a cocker spaniel?""

I decided to push my luck. ""Can I please have a little piece of bacon? Just a mouthful? I've been good, haven't I?""

Michael slowly turned his head to look at me, and I realized I had made a mistake. He put down his fork, pushed back his chair slightly... and slapped me across the face.

I crumpled in shock. My cheek was on fire, my ass hurt from the belt and I thought I might have an orgasm right there. Though we had discussed it, Michael had been reluctant to introduce this sort of play. I tried to convince him that it wasn't much different than spanking because I was really curious how I would react. Now I knew. Cowering on the floor, wondering if he would strike me again, I felt so in love I would have agreed to have babies.

Now he stared down at me and growled, ""You'll eat something soon enough. Give me that apron.""

I divested myself and was once again naked, not daring to move from my knees. Michael seized my hair and put my face next to his plate. ""Stay still."" He proceeded to finish his breakfast with my nose an inch from his food. At this point I wouldn't have tried to take a morsel on a bet.

Michael pushed back from the table. ""Put it in the sink, you can clean up later."" I hurried to comply. As I turned back from the sink he was already there and took hold of my hair again. Forced to my knees, I was made to take out his cock and it was immediately thrust to the back of my throat. Maybe it was better that I hadn't eaten.

Most of the time Michael lets me worship his cock at my leisure, which I adore. Long, slow blowjobs with lots of eye contact. When I feel like highlighting my submissiveness I'll take his hand and put it on the back of my head, or rub his cock lovingly on my face. Today was different. He was going to take his pleasure how he wanted, at his pace.

Still holding me tightly, Michael put me in my place both physically and verbally. He told me I was getting not just what I had asked for, but what I deserved. If I wanted to be the lowest form of slut for a day, no problem. I would be used at his whim, and perhaps by others, and I had best shut up and take it. He demanded a response and I nodded pitifully, my mouth full of his cock.

""Oh, and you were hungry. We can fix that."" Michael hauled me to my feet and dragged me toward the bedroom. Strange to think of it at that moment, but I actually mused that my day had only just begun.

Michael sent me sprawling onto the bed. He was tossing his pants aside and I began to beg him to be gentler, but he showed me the back of his raised hand. That threat made me cower again and I resolved to just quietly endure whatever was coming. He climbed onto the bed and gave me a dismissive push on my shoulder, putting me on my back.

Looming over me, Michael stared into my eyes with menace. Slowly, he snarled, ""Cross your wrists over your head, spread your legs... and SHUT UP."" I assumed the position, knowing I was about to be used very roughly. But I had been totally wet and ready from the moment he had slapped me, so I welcomed it.

We often have vigorous sex that makes me feel taken and submissive. But this was something else altogether. Michael lunged into me and it was off to the races. My ass hurt as it rubbed against the sheets and I knew my insides would quickly become sore from this kind of intercourse. But my immediate worry was how not to orgasm without permission. I was out of my mind aroused, and surely Michael could feel it in my extreme wetness.

I need not have worried. As my situation grew dire Michael suddenly stopped with just the tip of his cock inside me. ""Don't you make a fucking sound,"" Michael growled. ""I know when you're about to cum, and it's not going to happen.""

He did know me that well. In a moment he began thrusting again and continued talking, whispering degradation in my ear. ""You love this, don't you? On your back, putting out for me, your slutty pussy getting used.""

I nodded feebly and agreed, far off into sub-space.

Sensing I was close to going over the edge again, Michael paused. Normally I could plead with him for an orgasm (usually denied), but that was definitely off the table during my Dark Day. He soon resumed taking his pleasure. I had sagged a bit from exhaustion and soreness, prompting him to admonish me. ""Keep your legs spread!"" I put my knees up and spread wide, relishing the dirty feeling of doing as I was told.

Getting back into his rhythm, Michael now enlisted me in degrading myself. He directed me to call myself names, to admit my true nature. We had done this a couple of times before, but now it took on an even bigger power.

""What's happening to you right now?"" Michael prompted.

""You're fucking me like a slut!""

""You deserve this -- tell me you deserve this.""

""I do deserve it!"" I gushed. ""This is how little sluts should get used!""

""You like it this way, don't you?""

""Yes! It's your right to use me like a whore! Whenever you want! You own me!""

Michael began grunting in my ear. ""I'm going to cum! I'm going cum in that little pussy!""

Ecstatic, I urged him on. ""Yes! Do it! Fuck your slutty girl! Fill me up!""

Looping his hands under my shoulders, Michael lunged hard. It hurt and I had to force myself to keep from crying out while he emptied his balls into me, using my pussy for its intended purpose. He heaved over and over, milking out every bit of his orgasm while I waited for him to finish. I made sure to keep my legs spread wide and to not distract from his pleasure. I soon felt Michael's weight on my chest as he panted and rested. I felt beaten on the inside and out, but also very proud of myself. However, there was no after-care in my future. This was my Dark Day.

I started to thank Michael, as I always did after sex (I think it's only right for a good submissive to say 'thank you' for being used), but the steely gaze had returned. ""Quiet.""

I shut up and waited. Michael grabbed his camera from the bedside and sat up at the foot of the bed. I saw the red light wink on. ""You said you were hungry. I just gave you something to eat.""

My mouth hung open in astonishment as I realized what he wanted. I wasn't shocked that I had to eat cum from my own pussy, despite it being as nasty an act as I could imagine. But rather that he was going to record it. Friends would no doubt see me in this moment of unspeakable wantonness. My emotions whirled and then settled not just on acceptance, but eagerness. Michael had outdone himself again, and I was going to gladly participate in this humiliation.

""What just happened?"" Michael asked, surely for the benefit of future viewers.

Shyly but clearly I answered, ""You just came inside my pussy.""

He gave me a nod that was clearly an order. I reached down and slid two fingers inside myself, finding a swampy mess. I scooped out what I could and quickly brought it to my mouth where I made a show of savoring it. Then I went back for more, and did it again three times. After the last taste I licked my fingers while staring into the lens, then leaned over and took Michael's cock into my mouth for cleaning. He looked momentarily surprised, but quickly recovered. ""Good little slut,"" he said before turning off the camera.

Michael put me to work with household chores while he relaxed. But first he had me set a ten-minute timer on my phone, which I left on the end table next to him. I was vacuuming when it went off and Michael called me over. He was all business. ""On your knees, hands at your sides. I'm going to hurt your nipples.""

When I hesitated, Michael slapped my face again. I whipped back around and looked at him accusingly, truly shocked. He raised his hand again. ""Want another?""

Actually, I kind of did. But I felt it would be unwise to poke the bear. So I quickly went to my knees and prepared myself. I endure a lot of rough nipple play. But like everything else today, I sensed we would be going to unexplored places. He reset the timer to thirty seconds, showing me before placing the phone on the floor at my knees. ""After I start, you can press start on the timer. Then your hands go behind your back and stay there. Ready?""

I had questions. Perhaps there were ways I could exploit the rules to my advanta... No! Michael seized my nipples and the pain immediately went to 11. No ramping up, no giving me time to adjust. I cried out and my body twisted. ""Stay still!"" Michael admonished.",,2025-08-15T19:03:45.226547,3727,2.0

AN EYE FOR THESE THINGS

Jay drew closer to completion the louder the slurping sounds on his dick became. His girlfriend's mouth slobbered all along his shaft, moving like a piston up and down his stiff length. A warm wetness engulfed him -- made his dick swim in spit -- and sent tremors of pleasure racing through his body. He twisted his fingers into the frizzy mass of her hair and yanked her face all the way onto him. His hips thrust upward. His thighs spasmed. His balls contracted. And with one last tongue-swirling suck, he arrived at the door to oblivion.

As the first rush of cum splashed against his girlfriend's esophagus, he cried out her name.

""Unnnhhh, Sofi!""

He came like a firehose. Each pulse like a torrential rush. Cum flooded the throat wrapped around his cock, and the sporadic jerks of the body that tight passage belonged to milked every gooey drop of out of him. With a sigh, he finished, and collapsed back into his spot.

The last of Jay's dick emerged from Eleanor's stretched mouth. Drool coated her chin but instead twisting her lips into a furious scowl over her boyfriend moaning someone else's name, they curled into a dreamy smile. She had cum as well, one of her hands still between her legs idly playing at her wet pussy.

""God, that was hot,"" she said. Her voice dripped with perverted sweetness. The mattress creaked as she sat up and crawled next to him. Wiping her face and mouth clean, she flopped down onto her pillow. ""Did you think about her the whole time?""

""Yeah.""

""Fuck yes."" Eleanor's satisfied smile grew wider. ""I'm so glad you finally came around. You should text her back. Tell her you're looking forward to Thursday.""

""Oh, good idea."" Still catching his breath, Jay grabbed his phone and texted Sofi. That simple message turned into a back-and-forth exchange that lasted twenty-five minutes. And the entire time, Eleanor leisurely continued playing with herself until she fell asleep.

-------------------------------------------

Jay and Eleanor first met Sofi a few weeks into their relationship. They hit it off with the spunky yet sometimes awkward girl right away and the three of them exchanged numbers so they could hang out again in the future. That first hangout was proceeded by a second, and then a third, and then several more after that. Their casual acquaintance quickly morphed into a full-blown friendship, and through it all -- through movie nights, lunches and dinners, and various other outings -- one thing became very obvious to Eleanor: Sofi had a huge crush on Jay.

They both got along with Sofi and the three shared various interests with one other, but there was no question in Eleanor's mind that Sofi and Jay overlapped more, especially when it came to his nerdier pursuits. Sofi got technical about gaming, caught his obscure references, and read the same fantasy books as Jay. Her boyfriend seemed oblivious to it all, but Eleanor always noticed the sparkle in Sofi's eye when she laughed at his jokes or how she glanced his way with longing when he wasn't paying attention.

""It's kind of sweet,"" Eleanor said. The two were lounging in the living scrolling on their phones, with Eleanor laying across the arms of their chair and Jay relaxing on the couch. When Eleanor decided to tell him about Sofi's interest in him, he didn't seem to believe her at first, but he finally acknowledged it once she told him about all the little things. ""She's really into you.""

""Yeah, well, it'd never work,"" Jay laughed. ""She's not really my type."" A creeping chill ran over him when she didn't respond, and he flicked his eyes over to her. The perplexed image that greeted him turned his blood to ice. ""Not that, uh, it would matter if she was. But she definitely isn't.""

""How can you say that?"" Eleanor said and flipped around to land on the cushion. Jay scrambled up in his seat, ready to backtrack, to apologize, to clarify, but his protests ended up dying in his throat when she continued. ""What do you mean she isn't your type?""

Eleanor had no problem admitting that she found Sofi's crush cute but held back from confessing just how much the notion made her insides quiver... or how when she thought about it sometimes her hand instinctively drifted up her legs. Jay's response, however, almost made her feel insulted, not just on Sofi's behalf but about her own hidden desires.

""Uh, I dunno,"" he said, unsure of how to respond. The question threw him, and he believed he saw a trap lying in wait. A single wrong step could set it off and cost him a limb. ""I feel like there's no good answer here?""

Eleanor's eyes nearly hit the back of her skull. ""I'm not looking for a good answer. I'm looking for an honest one. How are you not super into her? You both have so much in common and she's so cute.""

""I guess? I just don't really see her that way."" He rubbed at his temple, confusion and aggravation building underneath the surface. ""You make it sound like I should be dating her."" Eleanor shivered. She opened her mouth, ready to object again, but he stopped her before she could say anything. ""Can we just drop it please? This is a ridiculous thing to fight about.""

""Fine,"" Eleanor said, stone-faced. ""I'll drop it.""

She didn't.

Eleanor prided herself in her matchmaking skills. She predicted with high accuracy which couples both celebrity and familiar would last. She hooked up more than a few of her single friends over the years to great success. And years of romance novels and reality shows honed her ability to pick up on who was attracted to who. The idea of her incorrectly assessing the situation between Jay and Sofi seemed absurd.

So, whenever they all hung out together following that tense conversation, she spent a lot of time noting Jay's reactions and trying to catch him staring at Sofi. Whenever they made plans, she kept hoping to see a spark of excitement in his eyes. Whenever she scrolled Instagram, she checked Sofi's likes to see which pictures he may have double tapped.

None of it paid off. Jay seemed wholly uninterested in the other girl, much to Eleanor's chagrin.

She simply could not understand. The more she considered it, the more it made sense to her that her boyfriend should find Sofi appealing. The more she thought about their conversations and interests, the more she believed that they'd work really well as a couple. And the more she pictured Jay giving into the desires he claimed not to have and making out with their friend in a passionate frenzy, the hotter and more turned on it got her. The idea of Jay and Sofi together infected Eleanor's mind and spread to her every thought like a perverted disease.

Getting them together became more than a mission. It became an obsession. One that seemed impossible the more time went on... until one particular night. The night of Eleanor's birthday.

Eleanor usually kept her birthdays pretty low key. She preferred a chill night at home over anything elaborate. This year, however, her boyfriend of six months decided to splurge and booked them a reservation at a fancy restaurant. She was reluctant at first but came around to the idea of dressing up for a night and bought herself a new sleeveless top that she paired with black leggings. The cowl neckline complemented her modest bust and the tights highlighted her long legs. With her wild brown hair tied into a messy bun, she looked positively spectacular, and Jay kept darting his eyes over to her and checking her out. It seemed he only had eyes for her.

At least until Sofi walked through the door.

Their dorky friend had understood the assignment and shown up in a tight black dress that conformed to every inch of her body. Her thick, dark hair was out of its signature braid, and although she still wore her oversized glasses, the eyewear ended up giving an innocent contrast to her overall seductive look.

For the first time ever, Eleanor caught her boyfriend gawking at their friend. It was fleeting. It was all too brief. But the reality of her months-long quest proving fruitful got Eleanor's heart racing and her panties moistening.

""Hey Sof,"" Jay had said as Sofi hugged her and wished her happy birthday. ""Love the dress.""

That simple compliment had driven Eleanor wild with lust for the rest of the evening.

Later that night, they stood making out in the middle of Jay's bedroom, his tie already off and her hair out of its bun. His hand cupped her ass and Eleanor grinned, imagining him picturing Sofi's much rounder butt in his palm. She knew Jay enjoyed groping her slim but firm derrière, but there was no question the fun that would come from squeezing and molesting an ass like Sofi's.

""Mmm, you looked... so good... in this outfit,"" he panted.

""You know who else looked good tonight?"" she whispered. Jay's lips trailed down her neck. ""Sofi.""

She gasped, her eyes widening with delight when he gave her ass a sharp squeeze at the mention of their friend's name. Quick and impulsive -- and brushed past like it never happened.

""I... guess,"" he said. Uncertainty peppered his voice. He tugged at her top and slipped it over her head. Jay loved the sight of Eleanor's breasts, lemon-sized and teardrop shaped, and he bent over to latch his mouth onto her rose-colored nipple. ""She looked pretty good.""

""Pretty good?"" Eleanor dug her fingers into his hair, holding his head to her chest. ""She looked fucking hot."" Jay said nothing but continued to lick and suck at her tits. ""That dress on her... mmmm..."" She reached between their bodies to rub her hand up and down his crotch, excited to find an erection pushing into her palm. ""A regular shortstack smokeshow.""

Jay released her breast and pulled back to his usual height. His brown eyes swam with a mixture of confusion, lust, and drunkenness. ""I... I don't know what you want from me right now.""

Eleanor's own alcohol-infused state of arousal had lain waste to her inhibitions, torn down her filters. For months she dreamt of an opportunity like this, a crack in Jay's armor. In a moment of reckless desire, she stated exactly what she wanted right then. ""I want you to jerk off to her.""

Jay gaped at her, mouth open and face in total disbelief... but his cock twitched under her hand.

""What? I... there's no way. Is this like a weird test?""

""No!"" Eleanor said. One hand still groped and stroked at him; the other rubbed at his chest from under his half-unbuttoned shirt. Eleanor's head spun with flashes of Jay beating off to Sofi, pumping his cock and calling out her name. She lowered his zipper, snaked his stiff prick through his fly, and slowly jacked her hand up and down his length. She kissed him hungrily, physically and mentally grasping at whatever she could to convince him of her seriousness. ""It's what I want. My special birthday treat. I'll even masturbate to you doing it.""

""I... I thought you were going to drop this."" Despite his protests, Jay kissed her back, his hand slipping under her tights to find her wetness.

""I will,"" she groaned, both of them fondling each other. ""If you want. After this."" She shivered and quaked, gripping the back of his neck for support as he played with her lower lips. He didn't respond, didn't say anything, but the precum coating his cockhead told her his doubt was wavering. ""I saw how you looked at her when she walked in. You can't tell me your dick isn't hard for her.""

""Okay,"" he choked out. ""I'll do it.""

If everything she'd said hadn't persuaded him, the mini-orgasm that soaked his fingers did.

Eleanor broke their kiss and stumbled backward. Her amber eyes burned like wildfire. She panted heavily, nipples stiff, soft skin flush. ""Let me get my iPad. I bet she posted a picture of her outfit from tonight.""

Sure enough, she found an image that Sofi had posted, taken by Eleanor herself earlier that evening. The picture had captured the shorter girl from head to toe, turned mostly to the side but twisted toward the camera, the curves of her body on total display. A smile on her face, Eleanor handed Jay the iPad and kissed him on the lips before sliding her tights off her legs and crawling onto the bed.

Jay watched her slink away from him. Her sheer panties left her ass almost entirely visible, and he followed the swaying cheeks with his eyes as she made her way to the headboard and then turned around to face him. Bracing her back against the wall, she spread her long legs and drifted her hand down to her panty covered crotch. His girlfriend really was going to finger her extremely wet pussy to him jerking off to Sofi. His horny dick throbbed with arousal even while his brain swirled with confusion.

Even beyond the alcohol clouding his mind, Jay couldn't understand Eleanor's fixation on their friend. Or more specifically, the idea of him being attracted to their friend. When she had first brought it up, he had thought she was trying to snare him in some sort of trap or that she was testing his loyalty. He had also thought he had gotten her to let it go. Yet here they were: her rubbing up and down her slit from over her panties and him holding an iPad with a picture of Sofi on it, his rock-hard cock sticking out of his fly and leaking precum.

He had meant what he had said before. Sofi wasn't his type. He preferred girls like Eleanor. Tall with pale skin and a lithe body. She didn't have huge breasts or a big ass, but she possessed a statuesque sexiness that was further enhanced by a vivacious sexual appetite. She was the type of girl guys fantasized about.

However, ever since she brought up Sofi in that way, the idea had needled at him, pricking holes in his original resolve. He had even found himself flipping through her Instagram a few nights ago, looking at, but making sure not to like, her photos. He had purposefully avoided comparing her to Eleanor, took in her qualities that popped in the various images, and had ended up getting a small stir down below. She was more of a nerdy and dorky type, a petite geek, but he had to admit, she was attractive. But nothing beyond that. Nothing noteworthy.

Until tonight. When Sofi walked into the restaurant, something cracked inside of him, some sort of self-imposed barrier, and for a moment, he saw her in a different light. He saw her as sexy.

His gaze turned to the iPad, to Sofi in that dress, her hazelnut skin complementing the black perfectly. He didn't want to stare earlier and had pushed his initial reaction aside. But now he could really take her in, study all those details about her that he often ignored and suddenly now noticed. Her short stature that gave her a level of spunkiness that often delighted him. Her large glasses that, while undoubtedly dorky, he found rather cute. Sure, she was a little softer in the midsection, especially when compared to...

He stopped himself. He hadn't intended to compare them, but it was really hard not to. However, if that door was open... Sofi's breasts seemed bigger than Eleanor's miniature mounds. Her dress tonight really emphasized that fact, highlighting the shape of her chest. And down below, her small feet led up to nice calves, shapely thighs, and that huge ass that curved out enticingly. He'd never tell Eleanor, but he always was more of an ass man, and Sofi's put every other girl to shame, especially his girlfriend.

Without even thinking about it, he wrapped his hand around his shaft and started stroking his cock. His eyes concentrated on the image of Sofi and a low whine -- not of anguish or sadness but of aroused delight -- erupted from the bed.

""Oh god, you're doing it.""

Pumping his fist across his length, he glanced toward Eleanor. His girlfriend still reclined in the same spot, but her panties had been pushed aside and two fingers were buried in her wet snatch. Eyes lidded with lust and mouth hanging open, she caressed one of her tits and watched him intently. She looked sinfully hot. The picture of eroticism. But as much as he wanted to keep staring at her, she wanted him to get off to Sofi -- and part of him wanted it, too.

Did he really want to choose Sofi over Eleanor in this moment?

He returned to the photo and another long whimper echoed from above.

He assured himself that this was a onetime thing. That he was doing it for Eleanor and that this would be the end of it. That it wasn't because his cock throbbed in his grip over thoughts of their friend. He dropped the iPad onto the mattress and the enticing image on screen inspired his mind to wander.

He fantasized about Sofi out of her dress but still in those glasses, her lips curled into a teasing smile, dimples in her cheeks. He pictured her naked body, the curve of her breasts, the thickness of her thighs, the question of what lay between. Did she shave? Eleanor did but he imagined Sofi did not. Judging by the dark hair on her forearms she probably had a nice bush of equally dark hair over her pussy.

""Oh, fuck,"" he gasped, more and more precum lubricating his strokes. His fist flew across his shaft as he pumped his cock in rapid jerks. The image in his head shifted and Sofi's fat ass filled his mind. It was so big. So much better than his girlfriend's. With fast, short breaths he envisioned that wide rear bent over in front of him, what it would look like rippling from the impact of his hips slamming into her, from him hammering her cunt with his dick. ""Aggghhh! Fuck fuck fuck!""

Jay's balls tensed. A rush of pleasure originating from deep within his loins exploded outward and he came, firing ribbons of cum onto the iPad, dousing the picture of Sofi.

On the bed, almost folded in half from having slid down the wall and not wanting to stop pleasuring herself, Eleanor cried out in joy, crushing her breast in her hand as she erupted in climax. Her cunt had been swimming in her juices, her fingers plunging into her slick wetness, while Jay masturbated to their friend. When he started, she had almost cum right then but her delight at it happening nearly ruined the moment, drawing his attention away from Sofi and back to her... but only for a second. Seeing him return to the image on the iPad, witnessing him frantically beat off to her, and then spewing his load onto her picture, it all was too much.

He had gotten off to her. Jay had jacked off to Sofi. And from the amount of jizz deposited onto the iPad and mattress, had cum harder than he ever had with her.

Eleanor had promised she would drop it after this if he wanted, but after witnessing that, there was no way she was going to rest until all that cum was inside of their friend. Thankfully, second steps are easier than the first.

Once a guy jerks off to a girl, he can never see her the same way again. It changes him. Changes how he thinks about her. Prior to that night, Eleanor had trouble ever noticing Jay paying attention to Sofi. Now the small girl seemed to dominate his interest. She'd spot them laughing together, his gaze slyly darting to her chest. Whenever Sofi left the room, she'd notice him taking in the other girl's hips and curvy rear. And whenever Sofi's arm playfully bumped against his, she'd catch the light blush of his cheeks and giddy smile on his face.",,2025-08-15T19:04:24.330068,3512,

Cassie turns to me and draws me in, her slim, french-tipped fingers soft and graceful against my face as she kisses me. Slowly. Wetly. Demonstratively. Then she turns back to Beth. ""Nothing has changed,"" she intones seriously. She leans forward, my cock still buried inside her tightness. ""Do you understand? Nothing has changed.""

Beth's breath is short and snorting. ""I can't... believe this.""

Cassie inches slowly back down to the base of my cock. ""Don't overthink it."" She begins to slowly, sweetly, fuck me. ""This is still exactly what you want. And you know it.""

Beth's eyes move to my straining thighs, my cock. Finally, to my face. ""Nick?""

My hands, unbidden, are sliding over the elastic spheres of Cassie's ass. ""Beth.""

Cassie arches her back deeply, slides her enormous tits over my wife's face,and positions one cute pink nipple right over Beth's thin, lax lips. ""Suck,"" she commands. Beth's mouth closes as if she has no control over it. Her eyes slam shut. Her throat bobs. But she suckles obediently, and doesn't stop.

""Good girl,"" Cassie croons appreciatively.

I expect Beth to erupt in indignation, even rage, but she doesn't. She opens her eyes and nods dumbly, still slurping at my girlfriend's pretty tit.

""That's right,"" Cassie hums silkily. ""You're so good. See? It'll always be like this now. And you'll always know you're so, so good.""

She turns back to me. ""Go on, daddy,"" she urges sweetly. ""Let's fuck? Fuck me? Please?"" Her sapphire eyes are round and sweet and innocently sexy.

I groan quietly as I begin to fuck her again, my cock aching to be spilling its held-back load into that perfect little cunt.

Beth licks and nips at each of Cassie's breasts in turn, her eyes slowly drifting to me. ""Does she feel good, Nick?""

""She feels unbelievable."" I let her see the truth of it in my eyes. ""Beth, she's so good. Thank you. Thank you so much.""

Cassie arches her back, her firm cleavage smacking Beth's face. My wife is smiling, now. Beatifically. Religiously. Like there isn't a thought in her head. Like this really is exactly what she's wanted all along.

""Open your mouth,"" Cassie croons. Beth does. Cassie lets a fat, frothy raindrop of spit dangle from her bottom lip. Beth doesn't hesitate, doesn't blink. Cassie lets the drop fall and Beth swallows it eagerly, blinking up in search of Cassie's approval.

""Good girl,"" Cassie asserts again. There's a hint of something dark and naughty in her angelic voice. Her pussy is squeezing my cock like a glove of silk over a steel fist.

""Come inside me?"" she begs me. ""Please?""

I can feel two sets of eyes-- heavenly blue and plain brown-- on me as I drive into Cassie harder, as my balls begin to tense and tighten. ""That's my girl,"" I murmur to Cassie as she dissolves in orgasm, my fingers digging into the soft skin of her slender waist. And then I'm spilling into her, spurt after spurt of cum that drips from her petal-soft pussy to Beth's stomach below.

I pull Cassie to me, sliding her over Beth, and kiss her and kiss her and kiss her. She's trembling, spent and helpless as always after we fuck. I lie her down on her back. I bend down and kiss Beth's forehead. ""Go on,"" I tell her. ""Clean us up.""

Beth crawls sloppily to me and takes my cock in her mouth, sucks my softening member eagerly, like she's starving for every drop of my cum. She darts down to suck each of my balls, then lies on her back so I can push my cock down her throat. (She's always given head best like that, supine and willing and slack.) Cassie leans herself shakily up on her elbow to watch, smiling sleepily at me as Beth cleans my thighs and then inches under me to lick the vibrating skin of my perineum.

""Oh my god,"" Cassie squeals, half-whispering, as Beth wraps her hands around my legs and begins to deeply, lovingly lick my ass.

I can feel Beth gasping for breath under me, her tongue probing as deeply inside me as she can. Cassie giggles. ""She's so nasty.""

Beth emerges, sweat-striped and panting, a few minutes later. ""My turn,"" Cassie bosses bratilly. ""But you'd better go clean yourself up first.""

Without a whisper of complaint, Beth vanishes into the hallway. Cassie crawls over to me and lays her pretty head down on my chest. ""You're heaven, Nick.""

""You're heaven, little one."" I kiss her plump pink lips. I stroke her silky golden hair out of her eyes. ""I love having you in my bed.""

""I'm taking what she said as an absolute promise,"" Cassie warns cheekily. ""I get her place in your bed and your life, Mr. Ellis.""

I laugh. ""Take anything and everything you want.""

Beth returns then, and Cassie rolls over and pushes her hips up to present her creamy holes. Beth buries her face between Cassie's perfect ass cheeks and this is when I know that this is all real, wax-sealed, signed in ink. This is my life now.

After Beth licks Cassie to cleanliness, my girlfriend curls up in my arms. ""You can sleep at the foot of the bed,"" she tells my wife, who crawls to the bottom of the bed and spoons our feet.

Cassie reaches her arms up like a child ready to be carried to bed, begging to be kissed. I suck her lower lip softly, then harder. She curls her leg over me; I hear Beth's muffled 'ouch' as Cassie accidentally kicks her in the process. We kiss tenderly, and Cassie falls asleep almost at once.

Sometime late in the night, I wake up to a blade of moonlight slicing through the room's darkness. Beth is a blurred lump at the foot of the bed, but the silver moonshine catches Cassie in entirety: her heart-shaped face, her unbelievably long lashes, her graceful neck and collarbones, her massive, impossibly round tits. I reach over to squeeze one of those enchanting breasts and she wakes with a lustful sigh; soon she's on top of me, her divinely bare, smooth pussy gliding over my thigh as we absentmindedly bump Beth awake, and keep bumping her as we grind our bodies together hotly, caught entirely in each other's nets.

Cassie climbs on top of me, her silky heat sliding over me like bathwater, the sheets falling down around her like Aphrodite's waves. She positions her lithe, light weight over my erect cock, a golden mermaid in the dim light. And then she sinks down over each inch of my throbbing staff, sighing as her wetness coats me, coaxing me in. I forget about Beth entirely as Cassie begins to gracefully ride me, her hands pressed on my chest, her cleavage insurmountable. She gasps and half-sobs as she cums, and I hold her in place, solidly fucking her, until she collapses against my chest. My cock lurches against her smooth, perfect ass cheek. And then I feel a hand, sturdy and stubby-- Beth's hand-- grip my cock and slide it back into the slick, creamy, waiting heat of Cassie's spasming cunt.

I lose every thought. My vision explodes into sparks. I lose myself to a hammering, hot, steely madness that makes my every muscle clench as I fuck Cassie's sweet snatch, while Beth's hand forms a firm, squeezing band around my shaft, beneath my balls.

Cassie's hands curl behind my neck. ""Oh, daddy,"" she weeps into my chest while I bounce her up and down my length, making her spasm and gush. I kiss the softness of her mouth, her neck, her breasts. I stroke her sides, her cheeks, her deliciously bouncy ass. Beth's other hand moves to cup my balls.

""Ma'am,"" Beth ventures timidly. ""I could lick my-- I could like your-- I could lick Mr. Ellis's dick, while he fucks you?""

""Oh, yes,"" Cassie agrees at once, half-giggle, half-shriek. ""Taste my pussy on his dick.""

Beth leans down and begins to lap at my cock where Cassie's wetness pools. Her tongue swirls around where Cassie and I meet, tasting us both, pleasing us both. We keep her there until I cum, my cream streaming out of Cassie's slit to Beth's waiting mouth. It's perfect. It's divine. And then Cassie and I shower, emerging shiny and damp to find Beth asleep, perfectly returned to her spot at the foot of the bed. (We don't know it then, we couldn't know it yet, but Beth would sleep there for years after, being jostled and bumped nearly every night as Cassie and I cuddled and made love and fucked, listening and watching and waiting for us to call her.)

In the morning, Cassie kisses me awake and then prods Beth excitedly with her pretty, lilac-painted toes. ""Hey! Make us breakfast!""

Beth snorts awake, her face lined and streaked with crusty drool, instinctively grabbing Cassie's cute foot. She looks at us with confusion, as if last night were a dream.

Cassie seizes the opportunity. ""If you're going to hold my foot, you might as well rub it.""

Groggily, Beth begins to knead Cassie's arches. My little girlfriend sighs, collapsing elegantly against my chest. Above the creamy sheets, her tan skin glows with golden health, her tits unbelievably smooth and buoyant and round. ""Oh, yes, that feels good,"" Cassie coos, snuggling into me as my wife massages her feet. She twists around to kiss me. My hands, as if magnetized, find the firm, peaked orbs of her breasts. I softly twist and tweak her nipples while Beth rubs her heels. Cassie giggles.

""Go on, then,"" she teases my wife. ""If you're going to worship me, you may as well kiss my feet.""

I keep massaging Cassie's swollen tits while Beth obediently puckers and kisses each of Cassie's feet.

""You can do better than that,"" my girlfriend scolds good-naturedly. ""Tell her, Nick.""

""Beth,"" I warn, knowing how she's respond to the steel in my voice, knowing it'll make wetness pool between her thighs. ""Don't such pretty feet deserve better treatment than that?""

Beth immediately begins to lap at the milky soles of Cassie's dainty feet, moving up to kiss and suck her little toes. Cassie and I both laugh.

""Now breakfast,"" Cassie demands, rolling over onto my chest. The press of her naked body is intoxicating, but-- alas-- Cassie has school, and I have a big day myself. So I let her scamper off to do her makeup and dress, while I contemplate the day. I have a dinner party tonight, with several members of my company who've flown in from LA and New York. It's more social than anything. I'd been planning to bring Beth.

I meet my girls at the table-- Cassie's dressed in a tiny, sky-blue dress with puffed sleeves and a deep, square neck, her lips raspberry-pink and glassy. Beth is in gray sweats, still looking half asleep. She's made a beautiful breakfast, however: buckwheat pancakes studded with blueberries and smeared with jam; little shots of foamy green wheatgrass; a smoothie that smell fragrantly of banana and mango.

""What a sight,"" I tell them together. They both beam.

I lay out my day for them.

""A dinner party! How sweet!"" Cassie's eyes are aglow. ""We should both go. Don't you think?""

I think of my partners. They're not a particularly stuffy lot; we take clients to strip clubs and glossy bars and golf courses; they might die of envy, but they're not going to fire me. ""How's that going to work?"" I laugh.

""I'll be your date, she'll be your wife,"" Cassie retorts tartly at once.

""Beth?""

Beth blushes beet-red. ""It'll be so embarrassing.""

I grin. ""So you're in. Cass-- can I pick you up at seven?""

""Yes, please."" She surprises me by blushing. ""Will you tell them I'm your girlfriend?""

I touch her sweet little chin. ""I can't wait to.""

She throws herself into my arms, knocking Beth's glass over, a tiny fairy of a girl. ""Oh, Nick!""

I drop Cassie off at school, kiss her goodbye. ""I'll see you tonight?""

She beams. ""Yes, please. Have Beth wear something conservative, okay?""

""Plotting something?""

She kisses me again, those candy lips lush and smiling. ""Always, darling, always."" She winks wickedly and disappearing into Cherry Hills High. I watch every head turn to watch her as she passes, the hem of her skirt bouncing up to show the very, very tops of her slender, tanned legs.

When I pick Cassie up, I'm again--somehow--floored by what I see. She's wearing a lovely, elegant dress of tight black silk, cut low to display just enough of her ample cleavage, cut just high enough on her legs to make a man wonder. Her hair falls in smooth waves down her back; her lips are red and shiny as summer cherries. She looks her age for once, could maybe even pass for twenty, and is every inch the perfect lady: feminine, delicate, desirable, pure. It's all I can do not to dig right into her.

Beth is in the back seat, wearing a cap-sleeved dress of pale grey that hangs limply to her knees. Sensible heels. Her hair limp and lackluster. She looks like Cassie's chaperone, maybe my secretary. I can tell her toes are curling.

My team is meeting at an elegant restaurant, in a private dining room called The Olive. There are six of them-- two have their wives with them, two have ""dates."" The other two are alone. When they see Cassie, the room practically vibrates.

""Mr. Ellis, hello,"" My boss, Edwin Ford, says with a slavering grin. ""And who is this?""

I offer Cassie up on my arm; her newly cherry-nailed hand rests on mine as lightly as a butterfly as she steps forward and smiles demurely. ""This is my girlfriend, Cassie."" I nod back to Beth. ""And you know my wife, Beth.""

Miles Farthing makes a strange sound, half-shout. Isaac Finch claps me on the back. ""Nicely, done sir.""

And just like that, it's done. I'm a god.

The table is highly polished mahogany, so shiny I can see Cassie's glorious reflection in it. My boss sits at her left, at the head of the table, with his ancient wife on his other side. He's leaning in to Cassie, fully enamored. ""Tell me about yourself, young lady.""

Cassie smiles gracefully. ""I'm so happy to be here. Nick and I are... newly connected. It's such an honor to meet you all. I feel so lucky. I know how important you are to him."" And just like that, they're all in love with her too.

A host of suit-clad waiters bring glasses of champagne and plates of pretty canapes.

""Beth,"" Cassie calls out. ""Will you fix my lipstick?""

My wife stands and takes the proffered silver tube, carefully applying it to Cassie's bow-shaped upper lip. There are titters around the table. My wife returns to her seat. I watch her shift her weight from thigh to thigh; I know this habit exactly, now just how it's squeezing that greedy, humiliation-hungry clit of hers. The thought makes me immediately hard.

Dinner progresses. Cassie calls Beth to cut her steak, to fix her hair, to dab her unmarred chin. Somehow, as the hours pass, Cassie grows only lovelier: her red lipstick smudges into poppied softness; her hair shimmers around her shoulders like a cape of candlelight. Every twist of her curved, tight body is sensual. Everyone is drunk on her. Beth is drunk on her. I watch my wife's awestruck face follow the smooth, soft slope of Cassie's teenage neck, her hands tracing the freckled folds of her own throat. I watch her swallow hard as she takes in the greedy arousal of the powerful men around the table, all of whom are slavering over my eighteen-year-old girlfriend. I wonder if my wife is proud of me, for commanding these men's envy. If she's proud of me as her pussy grows wetter, for having the sexiest little girlfriend in town.

As we sip dessert wine, Cassie finds her way into my lap, twisting against my thighs to face me. I hold her little waist, and its impossible not to admire how my fingertips and thumbs nearly overlap. Her body is so feminine, so perfect. She kisses my bottom lip soft, hungrily, sucking it lightly between her teeth. Someone behind me groans out loud. I hear the hushed rustling of men's trousers shifting as they try to accommodate their responses to my Cassie. My cock is hungry for her, furious at the layers of cloth separating me from her smooth, slick slit. She smells like cotton candy. I want to taste the soft, perfumed skin of her shoulders, bite into the tenderness of the insides of her thigh. My mouth is watering. I can feel Beth's shoulder, stiff as a board. I lean into her as my cock stiffens under Cassie's perfect little ass. She leans back into me, so hard I can feel her trembling.

We make our goodbyes in a daze. I do remember my associates leaning unnecessarily close as they bade Cassie goodbye-- and who could blame them? I could feel their eyes on us as we departed, watching the bounce of Cassie's taut ass. Watching my hands, each placed on the back of one of my girls.",,2025-08-15T19:04:30.334450,3031,
https://www.literotica.com/s/cuckqueans-night-out,Cuckquean's Night Out,Unknown Author,,,,,"There's this one restaurant that's one of my favorite places to go for a night out. The food is phenomenal, the ambiance inviting, and the service is great. Dan knows this and chose to take me there for a midweek surprise dinner just because. He loves to spoil me.

I wore a cute, casual top with a flirty hem, capris, and a pair of sandals. Dan looked extra handsome in a grey Henley. When we got to the restaurant, they sat us at a table near the back in a little alcove. It was very romantic and I could feel myself getting excited for what the night might have in store. My pulse fluttered against my ribcage and I bit my lip, flushing. Dan just smiled.

The waitress came to take our drink orders and I noticed immediately how pretty she was, with light blonde hair pulled back from her face, green eyes, and pouty pink lips. Beneath the uniform of a white shirt and black slacks, her body was stunning. She was curvy for such a tiny girl. I guessed she was maybe all of 5'2 and slender, with 36DDD's. She was wearing a little makeup, just enough to highlight her bright eyes and lips.

She introduced herself as Valerie and smiled. With dimples. The girl was seriously beautiful. When she returned with our drinks, Dan asked her what was good on the menu. We'd been there before, but he loved to strike up conversations with pretty girls to tease me. He even winked at me. The muscles of my stomach went tight and I squeezed my legs together. Watching Valerie light up as Dan asked where she was from -- Iowa -- and how she'd ended up out West -- school -- made me think all kinds of dirty thoughts about seeing them together in a much more private setting. My thoughts must have shown on my face, because I felt Dan's foot nudge mine under the table.

I said, ""I'm sorry, what?"" and both Dan and Valerie chuckled. I felt my face heat up when I realized that I had missed some of the conversation just staring at them. We ordered then and Valerie left us with a gentle touch on my shoulder. By the time she brought us our food, I knew what I wanted.

""Do you think she's pretty?"" I asked Dan. He laughed.

""Yeah, of course, I do. She's gorgeous.""

""I think so too.""

Dan smiled and took my hand as someone cleaned away our plates. I imagined his big, tanned hands on Valerie's pale skin and smiled back.

I waited until Dan had gotten up to go to the bathroom before signaling Valerie over. She gave me another of those adorable dimpled smiles and asked if I needed anything else. I beckoned her closer. She smelled like peaches.

""Would you maybe want to come hang out after your shift?"" I asked. I don't know if she knew exactly what I had in mind, but she readily agreed. Her eyes were sparkling when she dropped off the bill.

While Dan showered, I made up the bed with fresh sheets. I wanted our home to be inviting and comfortable for our new friend.

Valerie arrived right on time and she had changed out of her waitressing uniform. She wore a slinky white sundress that managed to look both innocent and naughty at the same time. It hugged her curves and the fabric was so thin I could glimpse white lace beneath. She'd let her hair down and it fell in soft waves to her bare shoulders. I greeted her at the door and invited her in, showing her around our place.

""Where's Dan?"" she asked shyly, coiling a strand of her hair around one finger.

""He's in the bedroom.""

I let that go and took her free hand, drawing her back into the living room and onto the couch. We talked a little bit more and I could feel myself growing warm and wet and the thought of what was to come.

""Can I be honest, Valerie?""

She flushed a pretty shade of pink and nodded. I put my hand on her knee.

""I asked you here because I want to watch you fuck my husband.""

I watched her swallow hard, but her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were glazed with lust. Her lower lip trembled a little. She was shocked, but not upset. ""You do?""

""Have you ever done anything like that before?""

""No, but --"" She flushed deeper, her cheeks turning red. ""I've done other things.""

I knew she was a pretty little slut, and I told her so. When she nodded enthusiastically, I knew she was as turned on as I was. I called out to Dan as I ran my fingers through her soft hair and touched her neck.

Dan came out in nothing but his boxers, his cock straining against the dark fabric. Valerie looked from me to him and squeezed her knees together. She definitely liked what she was seeing.

I caught Dan's hand and drew him toward us until we were both staring up at him with lust in our eyes. He smiled. ""Hi, Valerie. I've been looking forward to this.""

""You're wearing way too much clothing though, sweetie,"" I said. Valerie stood up, barely any space between her chest and Dan's. I tugged on the skirt of her dress as she shrugged out of the thin straps. It slithered down her belly and legs. I pulled it the rest of the way off, baring her lace panties and bra. I smiled at them both. ""Kiss her.""

""Gladly,"" Dan said.

I watched in delight as he pressed his mouth to hers, their tongues sliding together. I knew how good he was at that, and I could tell Valerie was enjoying the kiss by the way she pressed herself against him. Seeing her creamy skin against his tan, hairy flesh made me shudder. I sat back on the couch, hands in my lap, and watched as Dan's hands massaged her beautiful breasts. Her nipples were tight little pink nubs poking at the lace.

""Take off her bra.""

I didn't need to ask twice. I shivered in pleasure as Dan undid the clasp of her bra and threw it to the side. He quickly replaced his hands with his mouth, sucking the silky flesh. Valerie shuddered, her hands going to his shoulders to pull him closer. Her nails dug into his skin and Dan moaned. The sound went straight to my pussy. I bit my lip and reached up to slide Valerie's panties down over her ass.

""Is this good?""

""Yes!""

""So good,"" Dan agreed.

Knowing how aroused they both were was making me wet. I resisted the urge to do anything else, sitting back on the couch to watch Dan's fingers find their way between her thighs. I knew I would get mine later, and the anticipation was enough for the moment. Valerie turned her head to smile at me, her mouth wet and swollen from Dan's kisses. She gave a little gasp and I knew Dan had found her clit. He turned her in his arms so she was facing me, spread her legs, and grinned as his hand returned to her pussy. Her lips, bared by the trimmed hair, were glistening with her juices as he teased his fingertips between them, circling her clit. When she was shaking and trembling, I met her gaze.

""Do you want to suck his cock?""

""Can I?""

Dan agreed readily, stepping back to allow Valerie to slide to her knees on the soft carpet. She pulled his cock free of his boxers. It was flushed dark and wet with pre-cum. Valerie's pink tongue wrapped around the smooth head, sucking him into her mouth with a loud slurp. Her gaze drifted from Dan to me as she began to bob her head, her hand working his shaft. Dan's thighs tensed and his hand slipped into her hair to guide her. I squirmed on the couch, knowing how much Dan liked getting sucked. And I could tell Valerie was enjoying herself too. Her green eyes were dark and glittering as she made eye contact with me. It was so fucking hot to see her plump lips stretched around my husband's cock.

Dan moaned and cupped her heavy breasts, squeezing and kneading their fullness. I shivered all over, imagining his hands on me, like I knew they would be later when it was just the two of us. But for now, we were both enjoying Valerie's presence.

I stood up and took Valerie's hand, sticky and damp, to help her to her feet and lead her into the bedroom. Dan followed us, crawling onto the bed as I pushed Valerie down.

""You have a really pretty pussy, Valerie"" I said. ""Are you going to let my husband fuck it?""

""Yes!""

""You heard her, Dan.""

""I heard her.""

He slipped between her spread thighs as she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. I watched intently as his cock slid inside her, the two of them gleaming with her pussy's wetness. Valerie whimpered as he sank deep inside her. I stood back, my thighs shaking as Dan fucked her slowly into the mattress. Hearing their noises and seeing Valerie's hips grinding on his cock was driving me crazy. I licked my lips in anticipation, tasting my cherry lip gloss. I could smell Valerie's peach body spray mixed with the sweet, musky scent of sex. Dan fucked her good and hard until she was flushed red, sweaty, and crying out.

I knew the minute she came. Her back arched and her head fell back. Dan groaned and I knew he was feeling her pussy clench around him, milking his cock. He fucked her through her orgasm, the muscles of his ass working as he drove her pleasure. It was incredible, watching him take her on our bed. He shuddered as he came inside her, and I shivered with him, imagining the feeling of his cock pulsing and twitching.

""That was amazing,"" I said.

Dan and Valerie just nodded, both spent.",,2025-08-15T19:04:36.227633,1694,
https://www.literotica.com/s/luke-and-april-injured-list-pt-02,Luke and April: Injured List - Pt. 02,Unknown Author,,,,,"Luke wasn't that hungry, but figured he'd earned the calories. He stopped at the bar around the corner and killed the hour until his appointment with a turkey club and a pint.

Right on time, Luke hobbled back into the spa at one o'clock sharp, still aggravated at how much longer it took for him to move around nowadays. This time, the receptionist stood to greet him with a beaming smile as he entered. Well, that's a pleasant surprise, Luke thought, noting the subtle beauty of the petite young lady.

Katie seemed shyer than this morning. Her eyes darted around the room as Luke entered. But to Luke's surprise, the young girl stood and rounded the corner to greet him. Katie warmly rubbed Luke's firm bicep.

""Nicole's running a little behind, but I'll get you settled in if you don't mind."" The receptionist didn't wait for an answer. Instead, she interlocked her slight arm with Luke's and escorted him to the familiar room down the hall.

Katie helped Luke to the table and left to give him some privacy as he undressed. Luke couldn't help but chuckle to himself at what seemed to be a long-gone formality. Before long, Luke had settled in face down on the now familiar, and relaxing massage table.

While Luke was undressing, Katie stood just outside the door, waiting anxiously. She was growing concerned that any minute Nicole would finish her massage early, dashing her plans. Katie used her secretarial position to schedule some alone time with Luke. After all, why shouldn't she have her fun with him?

As Luke settled on top of the table, Katie was quick to glide into the room. ""Nicole is still running a bit behind, so she asked me to warm you up a little."" Katie whispered reassuringly as her fingers lingered down Luke's broad shoulders. ""Oops, I'm going to need that towel though. Can you just..."" Katie rolled Luke's hips and jerked the towel out from under his pelvis.

A rush of cool air surprised Luke as his penis dropped through the now-exposed hole in the middle of the table.

""Umm, is there?"" Luke started to ask about his newfound predicament when Katie gently brushed his back reassuringly.

""Premium package, remember?"" Katie purred. The temptation dripping from her voice raised the hair on the back of Luke's neck.

""I like the sound of that,"" Luke muttered into the hole in the table as Katie slid underneath. Luke's girth hung down from the hole in the middle of the table, tempting Katie with its robust size, a handful for the petite girl, even in his flaccid state.

Luke didn't remain flaccid for long. Katie was on a mission, and her mouth was already watering in anticipation of Luke's throbbing erection and hot cum. Her tender hand cupped the base of Luke's waiting penis as her soft fingers guided him to her warm lips.

Luke's shaft quickly doubled in size within Katie's eager, youthful mouth. Luke let out the air from his lungs. He was starting to relax.

Nicole had finished her massage a little early. As she escorted her client out the door, Nicole immediately noticed the first door down the hall cracked open. When she peeked inside, Nicole got a front-row seat to Katie's unconventional massage.

Without knowledge of her new spectator, Katie continued to suck and slurp on Luke's appreciative erection. Long strains of saliva and pre-cum hung from Katie's busy lips as she sucked eagerly and ravenously. Katie's scrubs were becoming wet, soaked by her progress.

""Those look like they're getting uncomfortable,"" Nicole interrupted, sliding under the table to join her receptionist. Despite her surprise, Katie remained focused. After all, it didn't sound like she was in trouble. Nicole grabbed Katie's cute face from Luke's shaft and stole a proud, wet kiss from her young receptionist.

""I'll help you with that."" Nicole breathed into her mouth as she lifted Katie's shirt to let her tiny pert breast free. ""Don't let me interrupt."" Nicole guided her receptionist's chin back to Luke's erection with just a finger. ""I'll help you with that."" As Nicole slid her pants off, Katie couldn't believe her fortune. Her boss was letting her have her turn and making it ten times hotter than her plan.

Luke would have to agree if he wasn't in a euphoric daze from the first-class service he was receiving, now with a show!

Nicole took a step back to admire her petite young receptionist at work, equally proud and aroused by how well she'd trained her. Nicole then thought of someone who might share her reaction.

April gawked at her latest text message; my receptionist is having her way with your man. Facetime me soon before you miss the fun.

A flush of desire raced across April's fair cheeks. A double feature? April thought. This is more than she had bargained for, but just what the doctor ordered. Truthfully, April had been missing Luke as much as he missed her.

April gave a quick look around the office before hurrying to the bathroom. Both stalls were luckily unoccupied, affording April the privacy she needed to indulge in her boyfriend's steamy production.

Finally alone in her stall, April peeled off her form-fitting khaki work pants, freeing her long legs to spread wide as she took a seat, phone in hand.

April accepted the FaceTime request and rewarded her aching pussy with some much-needed attention.

Upon answering her Facetime, Nicole granted April a live view of the underside of Luke's massage table. His girlfriend immediately recognized Luke's swollen erection as it dangled down through the hole in the underside of the table.

She didn't recognize the naked receptionist under the table fondling Luke, but that made it ten times hotter to watch. April saw in Katie a younger version of herself, but with messy dark hair and small breasts that hadn't been enhanced with implants like hers.

It helped that the girl was so engrossed with Luke, she seemed to ignore the camera. Katie's loud slurping and eager moans echoed throughout the stall, sending chills through April's already enthralled body.

Suddenly, a meek whisper interrupted April's concentration. ""I'm not interrupting, am I?""

April's heart skipped a beat. She immediately recognized the voice from the other stall. It was Faye from accounting. They hadn't worked together often, but April was familiar enough to recognize the voice of her voluptuous, redheaded coworker.

Her coworker's meek words replaced the horror that April should have felt with excitement. She wasn't the only voyeur in the room, and it was intoxicating. April's erotic plans were developing at an exhilarating pace.

April was uncertain how involved her coworker wanted to be, and she felt anxious about being recognized, but her lust was growing, and she couldn't wait to see where it would go as Faye's voice echoed beside her.

""May I...""

April's heart continued to pound with lust as she muttered in agreement. April nervously placed her phone on the floor between the stalls. The live stream was now in full view for Faye. Her eyes widened as she began to watch Luke's imposing vascular penis as Katie continued to pamper it with her doting tongue for the growing audience.

Faye immediately joined in with Luke's growls of pleasure as she joined in the watch party.

Katie's throaty gagging on Luke's penis grew louder and more frantic as she struggled to fit his full length in her mouth. Her lips and eyes weren't alone in dripping on the floor. She was starting to crave more than just Luke's cum. Now Katie desired nothing more than for Luke to stretch her dripping little pussy. She wanted to know if Luke could make her tight young tummy bulge with his huge, throbbing shaft.

Katie wasn't the only one. ""Enough bullshit! You need to fuck that little pussy of hers."" Nicole ordered her receptionist. Katie's heart jumped. She finally remembered her audience. Finding herself equal parts shocked and aroused. Katie's lust was in control now, and she obeyed her boss's orders without hesitation.

Luke was happy to accommodate, flipping on his back to let his erection stand tall for the pretty young receptionist.

The sight was nearly enough to send April and Faye over the edge, and their moans of appreciation echoed throughout the bathroom. Faye plunged three whole fingers deep inside of her as she gasped. ""Holy fuck, do you think he'll be able to fit that inside that tiny pussy of hers?""

Her moans increased tenfold as she leaned closer for a better look at the action on the phone. They wouldn't have to wait long to find out.

Katie's petite frame hopped onto the massage table, quickly straddling Luke and hovering over his daunting erection. Katie was more than ready. She grabbed tight onto Luke's shaft with one hand and stretched her dripping opening with the other, readying her tight pussy for Luke's tremendous girth.

Nicole leaned closer to get a better view for her and the rest of the audience, both now trembling in their stalls. April could hear the unmistakable beginning of Faye's climax just inches away, making it nearly impossible for her to hold back her own.

The young receptionist let out loud moans of pleasure as Luke's massive shaft penetrated her desire-filled pussy. Her audience gasped as they watched the small girl's belly button jut in and out to accommodate Luke's size with each thrust. ""Fuck yes, fucking finally!"" Katie shouted with dizzying force as she bounced back and forth, nearly choking on her pleasure as she forgot to swallow and nearly forgot to breathe.

""Fuck yeah baby, fuck the shit..."" It was too much for April to witness as her knees locked and she trembled in her voyeuristic climax.

The hot, heavy drumming of Luke's heartbeat resounded deep within Katie's slight frame, forcing her heart to race to catch up as her breathing evolved to gasps. Katie's mind was awash in a sea of sensations that transported her. Need took over her body as her already overstimulated nerves yearned for more.

Katie reached out for Luke's capable hands and guided them where she desperately needed them. Luke cupped Katie's youthful, slight breasts, propping up her writhing body as she used him to rock faster, back and forth on his engorged shaft. Luke's skilled fingers massaged Katie's hard, wanting nipples, quickly doubling her bliss.

The young receptionist's petite body jerked, arching her lithe frame as a flush of red washed over her youthful, supple skin. She reached down and raked Nicole's hair, desperate to steady her quaking body. Katie's short, soft cries echoed repeatedly.

Katie's groans devolved to whimpers of pleasure as Luke glided in and out of her dripping folds. Soon, Katie stopped and let out a loud exhale. Katie could no longer sustain the flood of pleasure enrapturing her soul. With her eyes swimming and her mouth agape, Katie's slight frame collapsed into Luke's powerful arms.

""Yes, yes,"" Katie whimpered without closing her drooling, exhausted lips. Luke felt Katie's tight folds throbbing over and over around his shaft, echoing her release as Katie's body rode out her last waves of climax.

As Luke growled in accomplishment, Nicole recounted Katie's lust. She grabbed the base of Luke's throbbing penis and slid it out from between Katie's quivering thighs.

Nicole eagerly suckled Luke's shaft, caressing his wide, sensitive head with her ravenous tongue, electrifying every nerve in his primed erection, vaulting him over the edge. Luke growled as ecstasy overtook his body. His girthy erection swelled in size and exploded his release. After the third surge of semen, Nicole gagged loudly, overcome with his flood of seed.

Katie had barely recovered from her post-orgasmic haze as she slid off the table, but her prize was so close. Katie leaned in to receive her hard-earned treat. Nicole emptied Luke's cum into the young girl's beckoning mouth. It was everything Katie had lusted over. A taste nearly enough to send her over the edge again. It didn't escape the notice of Luke and Nicole, who together slipped their hands between her legs to tease her dripping folds and still needy clit.

Katie clung to her boss's lips as she fed her Luke's sweet delicacy. Katie issued louder and louder moans as she swallowed every drop, before slipping away into another blissful orgasm.

Quite the finale, April thought to herself as she grinned ear to ear with contentment. Her body still quivered in fulfillment, clamoring to relax after her exhausting orgasm.

April took a deep breath as she collected herself. Before she could react, Faye's hand darted under the stall and snatched April's phone from the floor.

April sat in shocked silence, startled and more than a little confused. She began to yell out before she was suddenly interrupted by her phone reappearing at her feet. This time, April was quick to retrieve it. As she did, Faye's stall door swung open. The hurried clicking of heels echoed throughout the room as Faye dashed back to the office.

April unlocked her phone to reveal a fresh addition to her contact page. One with a provocative profile photo of full freckled breasts. The contact labeled; Faye ❤ for a good time.",,2025-08-15T19:04:42.197920,2205,

Just Us Experimenting

by TeamLightningStar

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Through confusing times, I become my genius sister's first. And a threesome ensues!

= = = = = = = = = = = =

Despite her many flaws, my sister is one amazing genius.

At 19, Dianne graduated college with a degree in chemistry. She was pretty much the top demanded free agent in our state for various pharma, tech and government companies, yet she chose a modest medtech one called Makrozoia because it wasn't shady, had a balance of female colleagues and they didn't hire her just to stare at her big, busty tits.

Me however, a respectable 5'11 man named Everett, had modest success as a copywriter and editor working from our home growing up because of my sensitivity to loud noises and bright lights.

In contrast, my sister is famous-slash-infamous around here in Columbus, Ohio and our circle of peers for being a foul mouthed, snarky, non-hygienic weirdo who just happens to be a female Nigel Braun.

Of course, I can confirm all of this because I've known her all my life. She's been mixing chemicals, making fires and calling them experiments ever since we were born in Thailand and grew up here in 'Murica. Now at our ages of 25 and her at 28, not much has changed. She has fussy black hair straight to her waist, only showers twice a week *at most*, likes baggy clothes, has armpit and leg hair and is still very anti-social.

All the hair stuff, I don't really mind. It's her stink that I do mind though and her fashion sense magnifies that. And she's not really mean per-se, just not very friendly and doesn't really go out of her way to talk to others she doesn't find many common interests with.

When she gets hot headed though, that's when the beast is unleashed. From a female Nigel Braun, she becomes a female Steve Jobs. I'd rather not go into detail so that I won't trigger my own war flashbacks, but she can blow up just as big as her old backyard experiments. Even since elementary, I'm the one who gets called over to talk her down or pinch some sense into her.

We weren't really as close these last few post-college years, but we still got along better than most sibs. These following months though as I write this, things have exponentially improved between us.

This started when I just broke up with a girl I've been with on and off again and I was sure this time we were clearly done. She was my first ever girlfriend, in fact, and since then, we've dated, stopped, became fuck buddies, dated again and broke up again in various cycles.

I've come to notice that Dianne becomes more nippy and argumentative whenever I'm dating someone, but, just like recently, when I'm single again, her flare ups stop and she becomes affectionate again like we were back then as kids.

However, I'm getting way too ahead of myself. It's said that to be a good storyteller, you need to 'show, don't tell.'

I don't really give a fuck about that too much, but I'll be going back anyway to when it all began in September.

= = = = = = = = = = = =

Glass doors beckoned me inside the white and gray walls surrounding.

An olive skinned beauty similar to my own skintone got up from the main desk, taking off her mask as she greeted me in the office outside their new lab. Her long hair swayed as she greeted me, ""Hey, Everett. Nice haircut.""

She was Evelyn. Dianne's recent co-worker, two years older, a bit taller than her, and the closest thing to a friend my sister currently has. Part Spanish and Russian, mixed just like us. She was the first person today to perk up my mood because of several things that happened that day.

I've known her for a few months now. She was just a couple of inches shorter than me and had that hot scientist vibe going in her lab coat and blue blouse-black pants combo suiting her figure and perfect chest. Of course, her attire had to match their place of work.

Speaking of the place, it was like a sci-fi set next to us. On the other side were beakers, white tables and little tubes with all sorts of containers and powders of different colors surrounded by see-through fridges and tray cabinets and dozens of whiteboards with equations that were essentially a different language to me. Separating us from the lab were another set of automated sliding glass doors accessible only by fingerprint and passcode. All of this added to the gray mood I've been having, which thankfully Evie didn't pay mind to.

I greeted the kind lady, ""Thanks, Evie. You got good curls in your hair. Looks great on you.""

""Aww, thanks Ev. Where'd you get your cut?""

""I found a new barber near our neighborhood who does undercut fades well. So, what's the damage today?""

We already had a mutual understanding of 'who' does the 'damage' whenever I fetch my sister. Hint: Her name rhymes with 'My hand.'

""It's tame this time,"" she replied. ""She just told off an inspector talking about her body odor.""

""Hmm... You all wear hairnets and disposable scrubs anyway, right?""

""Yeah, but you know how Di gets.""

""What, did she insult him by saying he's some kind of smell obsessed pervert?""

She smirked, ""Pretty close. She told him he'll never get a date if all he thinks about is how a woman smells. Then she went off on how none of her body odor is getting on to the mixes anyway so why the eff did he care. Except she didn't say 'eff.'""

That sounds like Dianne alright. ""Did it go on longer?""

""No, it stopped there. He just moved away and went. I already warned him before he even approached her. His own roasting, I guess.""

The lab doors open and, speaking of the devil, Dianne steps out.

""Heya, sis.""

""Was that text true? You broke up with that Renee cunt? That's great!""

Yep, her reputation precedes her. This 5'7, rosy cheeked, snow white skinned woman with rounded rectangle glass, plump waist, thick thighs and a 36F bust size truly was a sailor mouth. Don't ask why I know her bra size.

""...Nice to see you too, Dianne.""

""You didn't answer my question,"" she noted.

""Can you stop right now? I'll tell you when we drive.""

""Fine. You better not be lying. I'm going, Evie. Thanks."" She waved to her friend and logged out by putting her fingerprint on the biometric. The little machine on the front desk lit up and showed her name and out time: 'Dianne Crawford Linasmita' and 'September 9, 8:19:21 PM'

""Thanks, Evie,"" I also waved.

""Bye Ev. Bye Di.""

When we got to our car and drove out of her office building, she asked me at a stop, ""Sooo... What happened to Cunt No. 1?""

She numbered all of my exes by chronological order of when I met them.

I had to raise my voice, ""God dammit, Dianne. You just can't stop pushing people's buttons don't you? Yes, we broke up!"" Then I remembered to breathe deep and continued calmly, ""All we had left in common was sex and nothing else so we're done. Happy now, you misanthrope?""

She went silent until the lights went green. ""...Okay. I'm sorry,"" Di said, sheepishly.

""Good.""

I guess I'm lucky enough to be the only guy in the world who can push back on her BS. She didn't stay quiet long, however. She never does.

""I just think that this is a good decision, okay lil' bro?"" She said in undisguised joy, patting my shoulders and cheek from her passenger side.

""I see you're still not over your brother complex for me.""

""Hah! Nice joke, buddy.""

I just huffed and let it go.

= = = = = = = = = = = =

I think it's around 2 in the morning now. Dianne's finally asleep. I'm still here next to her in her queen bed. Finally at rest. I had to babysit her here when she drank again.

It's sad that she's only at her prettiest when she's sleeping, but at least she can still make a change. I found myself drifting to sleep until I was woken up. Light was shining from her window. Must be sunrise.

To my left was Dianne moving herself to sleep on my shoulder. She moved my arm to cover her as she rested. ""Sorry, Ev. Go back to sleep."" She had an old shirt on with the sleeves cut off and some pink boxers.

""You don't have work this Saturday, right?""

""Yes, no work today."" She clung to me like a koala on her branch. I tickled her armpit, some hairs even jotting out. ""Mmhh, don't be a dick.""

""It's cute though. Your little hairs.""

""Is that serious or a rib?""

""I'm dead serious. If only you'd shower a bit more and were less standoffish, you'd be golden.""

""We can't always get what we want.""

""True... But we can try.""

= = = = = = = = = = = =

To my left was the sun shining brighter this time. Lunch time, I'm guessing? Also to my left, Dianne's position changed into being the little spoon as my arm again covered her. Likely moved by her. This girl really does have a brother complex.

""Ev, you awake?""

""Hmm? Yeah.""

She turned to face me. ""Thank you."" Then she held my cheeks and gave me a chaste peck on the lips. After a whole decade of no lip contact, she was kissing me again.

I thought we were over this, but it was fruitless to deny her. She needed the comfort anyway.

""You taste like milk,"" she said.

""Oh, I drank some from your fridge last night. Hope you didn't mind.""

""It's okay,"" she said before pecking me again.

""Dianne...""

""What? Don't make it weird. Unless...""

She had the audacity to look at my boxers and catch me at half-mast.

She smirked, ""And you say I have the complex.""

""That's just morning wood!""

""Yeah, sure,"" and her body shifted again, moving on top of me and kissing me again. Then, her kisses turned into a deep smooch while her tongue touched mine.

I pushed her off, ""Dianne! What the hell! We've been through this before.""

Yes, this has happened multiple times in the past. I don't wanna talk about it.

""Hey, you said last night you'll give me what I need. This is what I need. Are you going back on your word?""

I knew I shouldn't have said that last night when she was being sad and touchy feely in her drinking again.

""You're such a bratty little imp sometimes, you know.""

""I do know, but are you helping me or not?""

""...Fine. Just don't expect me to kiss you back or whatever.""

""Whatever you say, Ev. You like this too.""

""Keep telling yourself that.""

Her tongue went back to mine and her lips started sucking. I liked her warmth, at least, so I held her close to my chest.

She broke off, ""Isn't it sad. You're still the only person I've ever kissed?""

""If you don't like it, by all means we can freely stop.""

Sleepily, she said, ""Nooo... I like your kisses. You should take it as a compliment that I don't need other guys' lips.""

""I feel more like a default option instead of a choice.""

""Nah, don't think like that, you Eeyore. You're like a favorite food I don't need to grow out of. Now I can have you every day again.""

""...That sounds like innuendo.""

""Hah, you wish.""

She gave a love tap to my head with her knuckle.

""Ow!""

""That's never happening between us, dude. You're starting to sound more like a sibling lover than I do.""

""Remind me who's kissing who now?""

She proved my point by kissing me again, ""This is a mutual thing. Don't fucking lie, you pussy.""

""There's no winning with you. Just don't french me again, please.""

""Fine, you prude.""

And this went on for about a few more minutes.

At least things calmed down after that and with the days after. The coming weeks were a LOT better.

And I got to know Evie better through our trio dinners. That's a plus. Even got her number. You know, to keep track of how Di is feeling at work. Aaand maybe some one-on-one night outs here and there that Di doesn't know of.

Unfortunately, things got out of hand again, this time not because of Dianne's faults.

= = = = = = = = = = = =

It was a Sunday afternoon at the end of November when I was informed that my sister was physically attacked in a grocery store by some unknown woman. She was given a check up and was now talking to police.

Me and Evelyn got out of my house and went straight to the police station.

I found Dianne sitting in a plastic chair next to a desk, leaning down and holding her stomach in pain.

""Di, what happened?""

She looked up, saw me and Evie and hugged me, ""Everett! Oh god, a bitch crazier than me punched me in my stomach!""

""What? Why?"" Evie asked.

""I took the last five packs of Cheezy Poofs and then this random crazy woman got mad that I got them first! I said I would have given it to her if she weren't so rude, then she tried taking one out of my cart. I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't let go of the pack. So I let her go, then she slipped because of her pulling at it so hard.

It all happened so fast! She got up so quick, then she lunged at me. So, I put her in a headlock on my armpits. She was screaming how bad I smelled, and then she started punching my stomach! I let go, and then some workers chased her off, I guess.""

""Jesus. What'd she look like?""

""She was tanned and had black hair and a hoodie. It happened so fast, I don't even remember much what she looked like. Ev, I really want to go home now.""

Evie asked, ""What about your stomach?""

""I don't wanna talk about it here.""

We took her home and ordered pizza for dinner. 'Hawaiian' with ham and pineapples. Dianne's fave. I never really thought the name 'Hawaiian' fit the toppings, but I'm getting off topic.

We just finished dinner and sat together in Dianne's kitchen.

""Feeling better now, Di?"" I asked my sister

""I need a long dick in me,"" she replied like it wasn't the biggest non-sequitur of all time.

Evie spoke, ""Uhh... Dianne? Are you okay?""

""I mean it has to be an actual dick, it can't be a silicone one. I'm allergic to silicone or latex. That's why I wear fabric gloves under my lab gloves.""

I said, ""Are you going to tell us the reason why you want dicks?""

""The doctor said I was punched near my cervix area. The pain I've been feeling is coming from there. It would need careful massaging, like if someone was injured in their tailbone they'd have to finger you up in the butt and get there to fix it. Since he didn't have anything to put up there and I didn't want him to, he said I'd have to find a partner with a big enough dick to hit my cervix and massage it there with his cockhead.""

""Dianne... What the fuck are you talking about?""

""It's true! Look, I have the doctor's note here.""

And she showed me. It literally said there on the doctor's note with the clinic's masthead: 'Patient must find a sufficiently engorged sexual partner to massage her cervix from within the vaginal area. Let the partner gently hit the lower or upper parts of the circular cervix area when laying flat, not the center. Massage above pelvic groin area for best results. Do it for five minutes as needed.'

""The fuck happened to medical science?""

Scratching her neck, Evie asked, ""Well then, are you going to look for a partner online now?""

""I was hoping you could lend me my brother's dick, 'cause you're seven inches, right, Everett?""

What the actual FUCK!?

Evelyn played it safe, ""Dianne, what are you talking about now?""

""You two are banging, correct? So can you just skip the denial?""

I huffed and had to answer, ""Dianne... Yes, me and Evelyn are intimate and dating, okay? How did you guess?""

""Enough of that right now! I need your dick inside me, please! Evelyn, is that fine with you?""

""Uhh... I... I don't know what to say.""

""Dianne, don't we have other options?""

""No, Everett! The doc gave me pain pills and other pains to halt some of the pain and bleeding, but it's only good for 12 hours each. I could only buy enough for 10 days. Even then, the pain can vary from fine to unbearable. Do you think I can find a guy online who isn't a dick, would find my lifestyle attractive and has a big enough dick that I would trust enough not to cum inside me? You ARE seven inches, right?""

""How did you ev-""

""Evie told me, but she didn't mention your name. I figured it was you when I noticed both of you would suddenly be busy after dinner, and you said you were meeting up with friends late at night and on weekends!That wasn't the only clue either. You two weren't exactly sneaky. Please, just help me already? It takes long for you to cum, right?""

Evelyn stood flabbergasted. I guessed it was more of Evie sharing our sex life without naming me. I tried to reason with her, ""Dianne, we-""

""Are you gonna FUCKING help me or NOT? Tell me NOW, you shithead! I'm still in PAIN!"" And I should have known there was no reasoning with her.

""Dianne... Fuck! Fine! You owe me for this! We're gonna need a condom!""

""NO CONDOMS! I fucking told you I'm allergic to latex and silicone!""

""Gaahhh! Whatever!""

""Finally!"" She went over to Evie and shook her from her frozen state, ""Evelyn, I'm sorry about this. I promise this is only for my pain. I'm not going to steal him away from you. In fact, his reaction right now is proof that he's doing this just to help me. I'll understand if you hate me, but please... I hope you don't.""

I looked at Evie carefully. I was scared that she might storm out or hit me or anything negative.

...But she floored me with her response.

""Can I watch?""

""WHAT?"" Both Dianne and I said out loud. My sister even pulled back from her as if she touched hot iron.

She went further, ""I mean... That's my condition. I'll only let you borrow him if you let me watch both of you fuck.""

Both of these women have completely gone nuts!

I pleaded with her, holding her arms, ""Dear God, Evie! Baby, please, no. I know we've been talking about you wanting to experiment with your cuckquean kink but-""

""Everett, this is the best opportunity for that! A girl we both know that won't steal you away and that we both trust! You're both gonna fuck anyway, so just let me, okay, baby?""

Dianne had to ask though, ""I might regret asking, but what's a 'cuckquean'?""

Evie answered for us, ""Means I wanna see him fuck a girl in front of me. Simple as that. But I get a say on what you both do.""

Of course, that just suited Dianne well, ""Okay, then. What are we waiting for? I can feel my cervix is about to scream again and so will I if you don't put your dick in me, Everett!""

What the hell did I get myself into?

= = = = = = = = = = = =

I heard a knock at the door.

""She's ready, hon."" It's Evie.

I opened the bathroom door from inside and stepped out. Evie was wearing her white coat for some reason.

""Oohhh... Those are my favorite shorts of yours,"" she said, noting my loose dark greens. Evie rubbed her hands on my stomach hairs. ""She's gonna love all of this like I did.""

""Can I ask why you're wearing your lab coat? And why do I feel like I'm being pimped out.""

""That *is* what I'm doing. Roll with it, babe. Tonight, we're experimenting. Get it?"" she said with a kiss on my cheek.

She took my hand and led me to Dianne's bedroom.

My sister was there waiting, freshly showered, covered in her sheets and sitting on the bed. Already naked underneath.

""Oh, sweet Di, I have a surprise for you!"" Evie practically sung to her, ""But first, you need to unwrap *your* surprise too!""

She pointed at the covers.

""Let's get this over with.""

As she said, my sister opened her arms and showed the beauty of her snow white, busty body. Her tits were huge globes, a cup or two bigger than Evie. Pink nipples poking out of cute perfect pink rings. She had the right amount of plump on her tummy and it suited her figure. Her curvy hips led to her hairy pussy and loose brown-pink lips. No points for guessing she was 'au naturel' down there too. And her thighs and feet look amazing as well.",,2025-08-15T19:05:14.582381,3729,
https://www.literotica.com/s/he-learns-wifes-secret-fantasy,He Learns Wife's Secret Fantasy,Unknown Author,,,,,"Ryan put down his wife's phone quickly as he heard her returning from the kitchen. She had a bag of popcorn and a generous glass of wine in her hands. He tried to calm his racing heart as she snuggled back up against him and resumed the movie. Julia Roberts was making some joke that made his wife snort and nearly choke on a handful of popcorn. He imagined what they must look like - the very picture of domestic bliss. Yet Ryan had just discovered that his wife's kinky fantasies went deeper than he could ever have imagined.

Opening Safari on Katie's phone while she ran to the kitchen to make popcorn had proved to be life changing. He had wanted to learn what movie he had seen the lead actor in before and instead had learned that his wife had a secret literotica account where she posted her most depraved fantasies for stranger's to read. He felt a tiny pang of betrayal but mostly he just felt more aroused than he ever remembered feeling in his entire life. Ryan was keenly aware of Katie's soft breasts pressed up against his arm. His cock was hard as steel beneath the blankets, a throbbing beat made it almost painful as it strained against his boxers.

Their sex life had never been better. The kids were all old enough for sleepovers and scouting overnights and Ryan and his wife had been having more sex in the past year than in the nine years before, combined. They had shared new fantasies and experiences with each other... she had displayed an increasingly submissive side to him and they had been enjoying lots of rough and degrading scenarios. But now Ryan was left to wonder whether she was truly satisfied? Katie certainly wasn't cheating on him physically but wasn't this sort of like emotional cheating? His raging erection confused him. How could he feel this sense of betrayal and yet feel more aroused than ever before?

It was sort of like her stories though. And sort of the whole idea behind the cuckhold fantasy. Ryan had never seen the term ""cuckquean"" before and now his fingers were burning to type the term into a search engine and learn more about Katie's secret desires. His phone was buried in his pocket though and he didn't want to draw Katie's attention to the tent in his pants. So he waited through the last thirty minutes of the movie, his erection never flagging. Luckily Katie's sister called just as the credits began to roll and she ducked into the kitchen to take the call. He heard the sounds of her starting to work on dishes and knew that meant she was expecting to be on the phone with her sister for quite a while. He took the stairs two at a time, grabbing his phone and typing the term into the search bar. He was behind a locked bathroom door before the results began to pop up.

Plenty of links to porn videos where beautiful women sat in chairs, their legs spread for the camera, frantically rubbing themselves while watching a partner with another woman. He skimmed the thumbnails as he scrolled, his cock giving an angry throb. He was not a big porn watcher, preferring his imagination to the over the top acting and scenarios in most videos. In fact, the last time he had watched porn had been with Katie. She had surprised him by setting up a random video on the iPad while she had gone down on him. A revelation that clicked solidly into place after discovering Katie's writing. Her desire to give him a blowjob while he watched porn made perfect sense given her other sexual fantasies.

Ryan clicked away from the rows of video previews and opened a new tab. He pulled up literotica and began looking for his wife's account, having seared the username into his permanent memory as he frantically shut off the phone when she returned to the room. Cucky_smurf78. Her birth year told the community how old she was. And it was no secret to anyone who knew her that she was obsessed with smurfs. But never in his wildest dreams would he have known about this cuckquean fantasy. His cock nudged him urgently again and he finally began to fist himself as he read.

The cuckquean wife stands in for traveling mistress

By cucky_smurf78

It was hot buried beneath the heavy comforter. Katie lay between Ryan's spread legs, gently licking his balls as his erection began to grow. She could hear the muffled sound of Lily's giggles from the laptop that was resting on Ryan's stomach.

""I miss you so much, baby,"" she purred.

Ryan's cock twitched against Katie's forehead and she moved up to run her tongue along the underside and took the tip into her warm mouth.

""Two weeks is too long. From now on we'll come with you if you have to be gone that long.""

Katie felt a surge of happiness that she was included in his future plans and bobbed her head up and down his length eagerly. She felt the blanket rustling and then his hand dipped beneath the covers and he pushed her down so she was swallowing his entire length.

""That's right, bitch. Take it all,"" he muttered, holding her there a moment before yanking her hair back so she could breath. He slapped his cock against her face as his cock reached full hardness. He squeezed her jaw open while teasing the tip against her open lips. ""Adjust the camera, babe, I want to see your face AND your beautiful tits.""

More giggling from the computer and then he was shoving Katie back down again. He began to build up a rhythm, his fingers threading through the base of Katie's ponytail and using it like a handle. She could feel herself dripping, loving every second of being used as his fleshlight. She imagined what he could see on the screen in front of him.

Lily was nearly ten years younger than Katie and you could certainly tell when looking at the two women. Lily was thin and blonde and STACKED. Katie's breasts were slightly bigger, but they sagged after breastfeeding four children, and she carried a little extra weight all over. She knew Ryan still found her beautiful but there truly was no comparison. Lily was a goddess, and she knew it.

Katie pictured Lily in her hotel room, moaning and rubbing herself for the camera. One hand cupping her perky breasts, tracing and pinching her erect nipples; the other buried between her legs as she approached her own orgasm. Katie found herself wishing she could suck on those nipples and reached a hand between her own legs.

Ryan felt her hand move from cupping his ass and chuckled. He knew exactly where it was headed. He thrust his hips upward, fucking her throat as Lily murmured encouragement.

""That's right, babe. Imagine I'm riding on top of you. You're so deep. It feels so good. I want you to come inside me and fill me up.""

""Oh fuck, Lilyyyyyyyyyyy,"" he groaned, and then he was pumping streams of cum straight down Katie's throat, her nose pressed against his groin, tears streaming down her face as she struggled for air. Her fingers frantically rubbed her clit as she gagged around his cock and then her entire body was bucking as she moaned around his shaft and tremors hit her from head to toe. Her brain completely shut off as she rode the waves of her orgasm.

Ryan let up the pressure on Katie's head just enough to let her breathe but kept her firmly in place as her throat continued to milk him and he shuddered through the last little aftershocks of his orgasm.

""Fuck, I can't wait until you're back,"" he groaned. ""Tomorrow let's try that vr chat program.""

---

Ryan struggled to catch his breath as he reached for some tissue to clean his hand. The idea of his wife writing this... it blew his mind. He clicked through her other stories. They were all about the same three characters - Ryan, Katie and Lily. There was no ""Lily"" in reality but Ryan had no trouble imagining who the character was based upon. His heart raced as he thought about Lauren in that way.

Lauren was a paralegal he frequently worked with when combing through discovery documents for a new case. Ryan's firm had brought her on a few years ago and he remembered Katie's jealousy whenever they had to work late together. He was enlightened enough to realize Katie probably didn't want the three of them to jump in bed together... but the knowledge that Lauren had played into so many of his wife's depraved fantasies made his cock begin to stiffen again.

He pulled up the next story and began to fist himself once more.",,2025-08-15T19:05:21.303698,1491,

Chapter 18

***

When master told me Clara was coming over, and that he was going to make dinner for her, I assumed he meant he wanted me to prepare a meal for them. What else could he mean, right? But no, he meant that he, personally, was going to make something.

My master going into the kitchen and making his own food while his elf is on hand and available? Madness. But here we are. It's not like I can tell him he can't do it.

I stay by his side and do my best to assist. He might not know what's best for him, but I certainly do. In the process, however, I'm repeatedly accused of 'hovering' and 'micromanaging' when I make suggestions and try to take over things he's too busy to handle.

Lucy isn't any help, but then, I didn't expect that she would be. She does not need to serve as the peanut gallery either, though. Snickering when I get scolded, or implying that I'm somehow trying to provoke master into disciplining me, these things do not make my task any easier. I'm merely trying to make sure master gets everything right, not misbehaving. And as if I'd misbehave out of some masochistic desire! Besides, if I really wanted a spanking, I could always just ask for it. Not that I'd do something so obscene.

I jump a little as the doorbell rings. Apparently, from each of our reactions, I'm more on edge about this than master and Lucy combined. Master enthusiastically dismisses me from the kitchen to answer the door. Lucy saunters after me as I rush out of the room.

""Welcome to our-"" I stumble over my words a little, ""home. Miss Clara.""

I nod my head and blush a little. She's looking especially attractive tonight, and if I'm honest, showing more cleavage than I've seen on her. My body warms a little, and I feel tingly. If I could scold my own pussy, now would be one of those times. I can't help it. Seeing her dressed up nicely like this, I automatically imagine master tearing off her dress, bending her over and...

""You're looking especially fuckable tonight,"" Lucy says from over my shoulder, echoing my thoughts in the most inappropriate manner possible.

""Lucy!"" I hiss as she embarrasses the entire household once again, almost like it's a verbal tick to do so.

She just laughs, though, ""I'll take that as a compliment, I guess,"" she walks over and hands me her coat, leaning down and kissing my forehead. Then she ruffles Lucy's hair in what feels almost like a patronizing manner. Which makes me want to see master fuck her even more.

""We're not early, are we?"" she asks.

""No, no, you're just on-"" I pause.

We?

Oh, right. I'd almost forgotten she wasn't coming alone. I spot a mousy haired young elf boy trailing her, and I'm a little on edge.

""Just on time,"" I continue, putting a mask of composure.

It's not that I have anything against elf boys, per se. After all, how can one have contempt for their own species? But they don't put me at ease, either.

There is some history here, for me. Before I came into mistress' service, when I was much younger and still lived among my own kind, I narrowly escaped an arranged marriage to a male that was, suffice to say, lacking in either masculine or respectable attributes. And on top of that, humans will sometimes breed their elves, and though neither master, nor mistress before him, would make me do such a thing, the idea of the possibility of being made to spread my legs for one of these elf boys has been unwholesome, and doesn't endear me to them. Not fair to them, maybe, but there you have it.

And, of course, perhaps on a more paranoid and primal level, I don't like the idea of unfamiliar males in our household, around master's girls. Even if they are as completely unthreatening as this one.

""I don't think you've all met. Lorelei, Lucy, this is my boy, Piper,"" Miss Clara says.

He hurries over and grabs my hand, ""Nice to meet you, Lorelei, I've heard a lot about you.""

""Nice, um, to meet you too,"" I return his weak handshake, trying to ignore how he's admiring me.

""Isn't Piper a girl's name?"" Lucy remarks, leaning against the wall. Sometimes her being a bitch pays off.

""It can be both!"" he responds, apparently oblivious to the implied insult.

""There you are,"" master says with a warm smile as he walks in, still drying his hands with a towel.

He embraces her and kisses her lovingly, something which I can't help but smile at. Something I don't quite smile at, but am nonetheless pleased with, is the way Piper is cowed by his presence.

He shrinks back with a nod, not meeting his gaze, ""Sir.""

If he already knows his place around human men, then perhaps he's something that we can work with. Still not thrilled with him being here, though.

The oven goes off and I quickly retreat to the kitchen, while master finishes saying his hellos. I'm a bit relieved for the excuse to get out of the room.

""So, watcha think?"" Lucy asks from out of view, and I almost drop a hot pan on the floor.

""Don't do that!"" I snap at her.

""Well?"" she asks as I put the tray down and set down the pot holders.

""Miss Clara is looking very lovel-""

""Not what I meant,"" she interrupts me, ""What about the boy?""

""What about him?"" I answer, coldly.

""Nice to see one of your own kind?"" she asks, ""Think master will want his own litter of elves? Or however you knifears breed?""

I just scowl at her and go back to what I'm doing.

""Aww, don't be like that, I'm just teasing,"" she casually rubs my shoulders, ""We all know you're a big slut for human cock. I don't think he's gonna start sharing.""

I don't quite manage to find the means to correct her vulgar wording.

""Still though, didn't you think he's kinda cute?"" she asks, leaning on the counter and watching for my expressions.

""I didn't really give it much thought,"" I dismiss her question.

""Really? I did. If master would give me my powers back, I'd go all futa on that boy in a second,"" she snaps her fingers to punctuate her sentence.

""Lucy. Overshare,"" I say.

""You say that so often lately that it's lost all meaning,"" she rolls her eyes, ""And also you just admitted you know what a futa is.""

""I... I just assumed it's another perverted thing that you... um. Shut up,"" I growl at her. Goddammit.

She snickers at me, ""Anyways, I think tonight, it could be the night.""

Dinner is a little awkward. Not because anything our guests did, Miss Clara is delightful and her elf boy is well behaved. But Lucy once again reminds us all that she seems to possess no filter, whatsoever.

""So are you all going to fuck soon, or what?"" she says, apropos of nothing.

I'm horribly embarrassed, and from the looks of it, so is Piper, but Miss Clara seems completely unperturbed.

""Manners, Lucy,"" he tells her, ""I know I've been a bit lenient with your behavior around me, but I do expect you to show some respect to Clara. We've become quite close, and she'll likely be spending more time here. So learn to behave yourself,"" master smiles at Clara and clasps her hand on the table.

He follows this up with quick wave of his other hand, and Lucy jumps and yelps as if she were just shocked by something, ""Don't forget that I have wards all over your body. Or what we learned about you and electricity.""

""It's okay, dear, really,"" she squeezes his hand back with a warm smile, ""I was a bit taken back when you told me you had a demon in your home,"" she leans towards me, ""At first I thought he was telling me you had a dark side,""

I blush a little in response and giggle. The idea that Clara thought I was a naughty little elf is funny.

""But I wouldn't still be here if I couldn't handle a little vulgarity from your little devil,"" she smiles at Lucy in a way that almost seems devious, ""I'm sure she'll learn her place soon enough.""

""I notice that you said it was okay, but didn't answer my question,"" Lucy appears to receive another quick shock.""

Clara takes a drink and smiles at her again, ""We don't have a time table or anything. I know you're eager, considering your nature, but we've agreed to just feel it out for when the time is right. We've just been enjoying each other's company.""

""Fine, keep it to yourself. It's not like the rest of us are sitting here with baited breaths, in frustrated denial while you dance around our master's cock like you've got all the time in the world,"" she leans over to the elf boy sitting next to her, ""We'll just have to find our own ways to amuse ourselves, isn't that right, Piper?""

She wraps an arm around the boy's slender frame. He blushes profusely and nervously and looks away from the aggressive succubus pressing one of her breasts against his shoulder. I can't tell if he's aroused, afraid, or both. Lucy jumps and yelps again and releases him with a growl at master.

""Not yours to play with, Lucy,"" master reprimands her.

""Where exactly are you shocking her?"" Clara asks him.

""Maybe I'll show you later,"" he says to her with playful grin. I try to hide my own smile at the thought.

""I would appreciate it if you be gentle with him, Lucy,"" Clara points at her with her fork, ""He's a young elf, rather soft and inexperienced, so not too aggressive, if you would. As we get to know each other, I may let you play with him. Under supervision. Though he'll be staying locked up, of course,"" she points down with her fork with the last statement to clarify what she means.

""You all can't keep surrounding me with virgins and expect me not to go insane!"" Lucy huffs.

I ineffectively try to hide a giggle, and Lucy stares daggers at me.

""So,"" Lucy shifts to a friendly expression and looks at Master and Miss Clara, ""You've got a male and a female elf between the two of you. Any thoughts on breeding them?""

""I don't think that's a topic you need to involve yourself with, Lucy,"" I say, practically through clenched teeth. Not funny, bitch.

""I'm not involving myself, I'm just asking about it. It's a relevant question,"" she says, with the sort of forced casualness that isn't fooling anyone. I hope.

""It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to,"" she continues - she actually fucking continues, ""And I know some people use insemination, but, and maybe this is just my nature as a succubus talking, but I think natural reproduction is always best. Get these two between the sheets together, you know? Make sure he gets up in her. A few times every day, if necessary. I'm sure Lorelei would be enthusiastic. After all, I'm not even sure she's ever had the chance to be with her own kind,"" she keeps going, ""Though it would mean our master here would have to avoid any sex with her, but I wouldn't worry about that, he seems quite capable of resisting her charms. Probably would be best to avoid any sort of sexual touching at all, since you don't want to risk his human semen getting anywhere near her pussy. Sperm cells sort of fight each other, they say, so it could be a threat to her getting pregnant with the elf boy's children.""

By the time she finishes, my left eye is twitching and my teeth are clenched so tight that my jaw hurts. Fortunately, Piper appears so embarrassed that he's turned bright red and is avoiding eye contact with anyone, especially me.

""The subject did come up,"" Clara starts, and I don't like where this is going, ""but not very seriously. The possibility is open to us, of course, but we're not all that interested right now, unless the elves express interest.""

""Call me old-fashioned if you must,"" master chuckles, ""but I'm not all that fond of allowing other males - even if they are just elves - inside any of my girls. Lorelei, her pussy included, is mine, and I'm not going to start sharing. If I did decide we wanted to breed her, we'd definitely inseminate, and we'd probably shop around to find the right donor. Sorry, Piper,"" he grins at the boy and ruffles his hair, then smiles in my direction, almost knowingly.

Oh, master, I love you! Bend me over the dinner table and make me your elf whore in front of everyone!

Ahem.

""Ooh, I like it when you get all possessive like that,"" Clara giggles a little, ""Am I one of your girls? That you'll keep all to yourself?""

""I don't know, are you?"" he smiles and brings up her hand, still clasped to his, and gently kisses her fingers.

Lucy looks bored and dejected, either because her ploy to humiliate me was diffused, or because she's off-put by all the lovey behavior. I, on the other hand, find it absolutely delightful, and think they're adorable together. I can't wait to watch them cuddle. Preferably post-coital. And preferably with me beside them, and maybe using her breasts as a pillow. They do look so adorably comfy.

I quickly look away once I realize I'm staring at Miss Clara's chest, and hope no one noticed.",,2025-08-15T19:05:28.924693,2319,
https://www.literotica.com/s/a-taste-of-maya,A Taste of Maya,Unknown Author,,,,,"Paul just called me and explained that he had 7:00 reservations at The Tilted Kilt. He instructed me to take a cab and meet him there, and I was to wear my short black latex dress, heels and my leather collar was to remain in place.

I love Paul. He is my Master, my teacher, my Sir, my protector, my lover, my partner and my friend. He excites me and challenges me to bring him new excitements, delights with my servitude, my love.

While I'm no stranger to dressing in this fashion for him, I was surprised at his request for such a public setting! I must say, my cunt was dripping with the promise of the evening, as I knew he would never want me to be exposed in this way unless he had something very special planned!

I arrived at 7:00 and walked into the restaurant to see him already seated and flirting with the waitress. She even had her hand on his arm. He watched me saunter to his table while never breaking his conversation, that satisfied smile playing on his oh so handsome face. My god, but that man thrills me to the tips of my toes!

He arose to seat me and when he sat back down, his hand rested on my thigh nudging my legs apart. Paul turned his attention back to the waitress and said, ""Maya, she'll have a cup of coffee and water with lime and I'll have a refill, please."" She was watching his hand and unconsciously licking her lips and replied with a weak, ""Yes, Sir.""

After watching the lovely girl walk away, Paul turned his attention back to me and said with that infuriatingly sexy smile, ""You look beautiful, my dear. You did so well following my directions that I have a reward for you tonight."" Then he shoved a finger inside my cunt while watching my face, enjoying that he had taken me by surprise. It is extremely hard to maintain one's composure when you have the world's most handsome man's finger shoved forcefully into one's cunt! I did gasp quite audibly, though, causing our nearest neighbors to look our way.

Maya had returned with our drinks and her eyes were glued to my Sir's hand! She sat the drinks down, bending over Paul's free arm and brushing her magnificent tits against him. While never removing his hand and what he was doing with it, he gazed and smiled at his waitress and said, ""Thank you, sexy girl!""

She replied with her own smile saying, ""I don't want to go, but I'll be right back to take your order, Sir.""

Paul turned to me. He looked into my eyes and smiled a gentle smile at me and said, ""I love you. Tonight, I will not acknowledge you while we are in the company of others. When I give you directions, you are to carry them out without question or hesitation. Do you understand, my pet?""

""Yes, Sir,"" I replied, blushing furiously. ""I love you, too, and will do everything you ask.""

""Good girl. Now, I wonder...how do you think Maya would taste? I've been sitting here this whole time thinking of nothing else, and I do believe I'll find out! My cock is so hard for her.""

Just then, Maya returned to my Master's table. Without taking his eyes from her, he removed his finger and held it in front of my lips. I leaned forward and cleaned my cunt juices from his finger while he ordered for himself, saying that his guest would not be dining. Before leaving to place his order, Maya leaned close to him and, again, placed her hand on his arm. She whispered loudly enough for me to hear, ""It will be my pleasure to serve you, Sir,"" and smiling he replied, ""Yes, it will be your pleasure, Maya."" While she was still leaning in, Paul casually and feather lightly brushed her nipple with the back of his hand. I could hear her intake of breath and see the flush on her face and chest, and she said, ""Thank you, Sir. I'll be right back with your order!""

Paul turned to look at me and asked, ""Did you enjoy that, my pet?""

When I stated that I had enjoyed it very much, my Sir replied, ""I'm very happy to hear that, cunt, but it honestly wouldn't have mattered to me if you had not.""

I excused myself to visit the ladies' room. When I opened the door, there stood Maya adjusting her lip gloss! She saw me in the reflection of the mirror but did not speak to me, although she smiled at me condescendingly.

When I was done and had freshened up, I returned to the table to find food set in front of my Master and Maya leaning down by Paul with his hand on the small of her back, their heads very close together speaking softly. I seated myself watching the exchange with my cunt on fire! I so wanted to feel his hand resting on the back of my neck or the small of my back, but to see him touch another woman so intimately while ignoring my presence made me want to grind my cunt into my chair! He discretely tweeked her nipple and said, ""Once I have finished my meal, we will speak further of this.""

Again, he watched her walk away with that smile on his face then started eating, occasionally lifting his fingers for me to taste and clean with my mouth.

Once he was done, he turned to me and said, ""I love you. You are to exit the restaurant, and I want you to walk around to the back and stand facing the wall. You will not speak. You will not turn around no matter what. And you will accept what will be happening to you.""

Maya walked over to Paul under the guise of removing his dishes. I stood up to leave and was acknowledged by neither of them, as they only had eyes for each other and I heard my Sir say, ""Oh, you sexy, naughty little girl! Daddy's going to have to spank you!"" and her giggles...

I did as I was told and entered the alley behind the restaurant and stood facing the wall. I waited, my chest heaving with excitement and fear. I was afraid to be alone in an alley dressed the way I was, but I knew my Master would never let anything or anyone harm me.

I heard footsteps and my breath quickened. I wanted to look and to hide if it were someone approaching my way, but I could not disobey my One. So I stood there, shaking.

I was shoved hard from behind and slammed up against the wall. I felt the barrel of a gun press against my temple and hot breath on my neck. My dress was yanked up over my ass, and I heard fumbling and a zipper. And a huge cock shoved into my cunt. The hand not holding the gun came up and covered my mouth, fingers roughly working their way between my lips, and I tasted sweetness.

I was being raped.

The voice in my ear menacingly whispered, ""Do you like this, cunt? Do you like being used while I'm thinking about fucking someone else? Did you taste that sexy little girl's juice on my fingers?""

Before I could answer, my Master exploded in my cunt. I dropped to my knees immediately and took his beautiful cock into my mouth cleaning him.

He picked me up and held me so close to him, crushing me to him.

My love spoke softly in my ear, ""I love you so, my beautiful girl. Let's go home.""",,2025-08-15T19:05:35.056202,1297,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-birthday-present-40,The Birthday Present,Unknown Author,,,,,"Master calls me and tells me to be ready at the door, naked, on my knees. I wait for an hour before they arrive. It is an excruciating, emotionally tormenting wait, but I'm excited that I know I am obeying him. Nothing makes me happier than to please my Master. I pinch my nipples, play with my dripping cunt and edge several times before I hear him drive in. It takes another 15 minutes before I hear the car doors and hear talking and laughing as they come up the walk.

The door opens and I look up at him. He immediately smacks my face and orders me ""eyes down!"" I drop my gaze and see a beautiful pair of patent leather, spiked heeled ankles step in front of me and stop. ""This is her? I understand why you need other women; she looks like a pathetic, little cunt. Why did you ever marry her?""

""She was a beauty when I met her. She was a challenge to train, she thought she was in charge, it took years to break her into the cuckquean slave she is today. She has put on some weight, and when she couldn't lose it, that's when I broke her spirit, she understood that I would find more attractive women to fuck and that if she wanted to continue the relationship she better start serving me as a sex and domestic slave. She serves me well. That's why I married her. Now I only refer to her as cunt, toilet, pig or whore. Call her whatever you want but please, no longer refer to it as ""her,"" it goes to her head and she forgets her place.""

I've heard him recite this many times to the whores he brings home. I always know I am his slave though and will never be replaced. He needs me and I need him. We are bonded together in this Master/slave dynamic and no one will ever replace me. They come, they go. I serve him and them while they are here. He gives them no control over me; he is the only one that can tell me what to do.

He grabs a handful of my hair and shoves my face down to her feet. ""Lick her feet whore!"" I dutifully start licking the top part of her foot, she slowly moves the two of her pointy shoe into my mouth as Master pushes from the back of my head. Startled, I pull back. He has never told me to do this to anyone else. This feels different than all the other times.

""Stupid little pig! Lick my shoe clean!"" she barks. My tongue runs along the slick shiny shoe. I smell her musky perfume as she reaches down and gently strokes my face. I turn my head toward her hand...SMACK!! She cracks me across the face. Master laughs and says, ""Nice. Show her that you are the boss and use her and abuse her as you wish.""

I look up to see who this woman is that Master has given power to use me as he does. I expect to feel another smack from Master for looking up but I can't resist. She has long black hair, straight and shiny, eyes that are dark and piercing. Bright red lipstick that matches her tight, short scarlet dress. Her porcelain skin appears flawless compared to my ruddy, olive skin. Perfect, perky C cup breasts, cupped in a black lacy bra peeking seductively out of her dress. A deep pang in my chest and sense of inferiority washes over me. Of course Master would want her. She is prettier and classier than all the rest of them. I can feel her energy. I meet all of his needs domestically and of course I am used as a cum dump. I am not her. She is here to fulfill him in ways I can't. I can feel it.

Master reaches under my chin to direct my gaze towards his eyes. ""Meet Sophia, my girlfriend and your new Mistress pig. You will address her as Mistress Sophia or Mistress at all times. You will obey her as you do me. She will punish you for not obeying or complying with her wishes. If I hear from her that you do not respect her rule over you in any way, you will be punished twice as hard by me. Say hello.""

""Hello Mistress Sophia.""

""Hello pig."" Lower your gaze and go get me an extra dirty martini, three olives.""

I start to get up to retrieve her drink...SMACK!!! Her hand meets my right cheek and and upper lip.... SMACK!! My left cheek is now stinging more than the right. My tongue instinctively goes to my sore lip, the metallic taste of blood trickles into my mouth. My head is spinning from the blows and in complete confusion.

""You let her walk on two legs without permission?""

""I do, but you my train her however you wish. She will learn fast if you continue to treat her like the slave pig she is. ""

Train me however she wishes?? WTF??

""You may never stand from a kneeling position unless you are instructed to! Assume you will crawl everywhere otherwise. You will crawl to the kitchen, then you may get up, fix my drink and bring it to me. Go!!""

OMG!! Is this for real? Certainly Master would not let her make me crawl everywhere. I glance up at Master. Without words, my confused look asks him what is happening. He grabs my hair, snaps my head back and spits in my face. ""Go now pig!!""

It's real. She is now my Mistress and they obviously are not fooling around. I start to crawl on the wood floor towards the kitchen in disbelief. As I turn to go, I am kicked hard in the ass and I fall forward on my face.

""You had better remember that if you do not listen or immediately respond to your punishment from your Mistress, you will be punished again twice as hard by me."" Master calmly continues, ""How stupid for you to already have messed up. I told Sophia that you were a good slave, you better start acting as such.""

""Yes Sir."" I pick myself back up and continue to crawl away in shame for being so stupid.

""Well, at least she is prettier than I expected. I will get her trained well after I move in next week. I will enjoy using her baby, thank you so much."" I can hear her from the kitchen as I'm making her drink.

I find they moved to the living room, cuddling on the couch in front of the fire. I carry her drink to her and hand Master a beer.

""Take her shoes off, then go upstairs to the bedroom."" Obediently, I remove her shoes. She sticks her toes in my mouth just as she did earlier but much slower and sensually. I look up at her and she is completely ignoring me as Master is kissing her deeply and passionately. I have never seen him kiss anyone else like that but me.

Her hand is rubbing his hard cock under his pants. He has her perfect breast cupped, then sits back and in one quick grab with both hands pulls her dress and bra to the sides of her milky, white orbs. He reaches up and rolls her dark, hard nipple between his fingers. ""Crawl."" He doesn't even look at me.

Slowly, I drop and start crawling toward the stairs. ""Go sit in your chair.""

The chair is where I've watched Master fuck many women while they either ignore me or wait until I am instructed to service his whores however he instructs. Prepare them with my tongue, lick their pussies and assholes until they are hot and wet for him. Lick and suck their nipples until they are hard for him. He will usually just push me away and order me to sit. I go back to my chair, watch and wish it was me. My pussy drips and aches for his cock as they mentally torment me. I love it. The jealousy, envy mixed with watching him gently or roughly fucks them, while I am denied any release is so humiliating and exquisite at the same time.

My heart is beating so hard. Mistress?? Move in next week?? The shock of being treated like I was downstairs is melting away and the reality of what is really happening starts to sink in. He likes fucking other pussies, I never expected this though. My heart is heavy and is sinking fast and hard. I never knew this could happen.... Mistress Sophia.

The sound of them coming up the stairs startles me and shakes me out of my confused misery. The door swings open and Mistress Sophia walks in naked. Beautiful. Long legs, smooth pussy, perky, perfect real breasts.

""Come pig.""

I drop off the chair to my knees, look down and crawl to her. Her hand pulls my face into her musky, dripping pussy. My tongue finds her clit and I start gently flicking it gently. God she tastes good. My tongue explores her folds as she starts pushing harder against my face it's hard to breathe.

Without warning, I feel Master's hard cock replace her hand on the back of my head. He is embracing her and kissing her above me as he pushes me harder and deeper into her cunt. ""Happy Birthday Baby, I hope you like your gift.""

The bed grew more dishevelled by the second as the nude female form, splashed in moonlight from the window, thrashed on the bed. Her breath came in sharp, short gasps. With each hitch of her chest, her petite breasts would give a little jiggle, just enough for the sensation to add to the waves of pleasure coming from her clit and pussy.

Her hands were busy between her legs, one feverishly rubbing at her clitoris, the other had three fingers, knuckle-deep shoved up her weeping cooch. She'd long ago soaked the sheets beneath her with sweat and vaginal secretions. The smell of her musk hung heavy in the air, heady and strong, almost overpowering. Each breath brought the scent to her nostrils and the memories it invoked made her moan.

Her mind was a whirlwind. Anger, lust, fear, humiliation all warred inside her head. She couldn't control these feelings, unable to find purchase on them, unable to GRIP them. She was at their mercies like a gang of abusive lovers.

'Where is he?' she thought through the haze.

He had promised he'd be home hours ago. ""Home in time for dinner,"" he'd said, brushing aside a rebellious curl of hair from his head, in a gesture as habitual as it was endearing to her. ""Just some half-assed training meeting.""

She'd nodded and wished him a happy day, even though she knew the truth. He was a terrible liar.

'He's with that SLUT!' she screamed inwardly, but no words came from her mouth. Instead, she let loose a sound halfway btween a wailing sob and a furious roar. Her probing, rubbing fingers hit her sweetspot from both the in- and outside right at that moment and for a brief instant she felt like she was falling.

Her orgasm hit her with enough force to clamp her jaw shut. She arched her back, pressing her weight excruciatingly into her wings. Beneath her upraised ass, her tail lashed back and forth, the retractable barb at the tip flicking in and out like a snake tongue.

She collapsed, her muscles twitching, the aftershocks of her orgasm hitting her again and again.

And so Marini Gilbert, wife of Caleb Gilbert, daughter of the Manticore Nation, dozed in the afterglow of her orgasm until drifting off to sleep.

When she woke hours later, the sky was just beginning to turn a rosy pink. She sat up, scratched an itch at her side, then cursed the open window. She pawed at the control panel before finally finding the button to lower the blinds.

She picked up one of the soaked sheets she had lain on and sniffled. The sour smell made her nose wrinkle. She swung her legs out and down to the floor, but fell backwards when she tried to stand up. Sleep-drunk her husband called it; Marini called it too early in the day.

With bleary eyes and a sleep-muddled brain she stumbled her way to the bathroom. The cold tile and harsh light woke her up as much as a solid slap in the face. She was washing her hands when the front door opened.

Trembling, and with a lump in her throat, she went back into the bedroom. There was Caleb, dark hair ruffled, locks and curls thrown every which way. He always managed to look like he'd just woken up unless he took great care to keep his unruly hair under control.

""You're late,"" she said, trying to sound angry. She couldn't be sure, but she didn't think it worked.

He turned just his head to looked at her. His blue, human eyes smiled a trickster's grin.

""Long night,"" he said, louding the words with meaning. Images began to dance in Marini's mind; of him and this office slut of his, naked and entertwined.

Her mouth was suddenly very dry.

Caleb, already having shucked his button-up, reached beneath the hem of his undershirt. Marini, with a murmered ""Let me,"" hurried over to help him. She stepped up behind him, pulling the shirt over his head. Once it was off, she wrapped her arms around his muscled chest and leaned against him. In an old familiar gesture, her head came to rest on his broad back.

He smelled... She couldn't describe it. Powerful and masculine. But below that was a scent, a musk that was wholly feminine and wholly foreign to her. Between her legs, she felt a warm tingle begin to grow.

She blushed at her body's reaction, and curled her wings over her head.

Caleb heard his wife murmur something into his shoulder. ""What? Didn't catch that.""

Marini grumbled weakly, then unfurled her wings and lifted her head. ""I asked,""she said before trailing off.

Caleb half broke from her embrace, turning to face Marini. Holding her hand in his, he said ""What did you ask?""

Marini, already wearing a pretty pink blush on her dark skin, shuffled her feet lamely and stared at the floor.

""I-I asked,"" she said finally""'What's her name?'""

A wicked, sadistic thrill flared through Caleb. ""Who do you mean?"" he asked, all sweetness and innocence.

""You bastard,"" she mumbled, ""You know who I mean. Don't make me say it.""

""No, I don't think I know who this 'her' is. Could you be more specific?"" he asked, lopsided grin on his face.

She glared at him with a fury that guttered out in a moment. In it's passing, she was flushed and looking at him pleadingly.

She managed to stammer out, ""The woman you're fucking.""

Her thoughts swirled around in her head, tumbling out of reach. Saying it out loud had started an avalache of mental images, visions of her husband with some unknown woman. Those images chilled her and enraged her.

She didn't know if she was hurt, angry, or relieved. But one thing rang loud and clear through her mind.

She was horny as fuck!

Looking up at him, she knew her lust must be written all over her face. His expression was too smug for her desire to be anything but painfully obvious.

Caleb felt himself stiffening under his wife's gaze. He let go of her hand to trail his fingers down her sides to her hips. Marini shivered under the feel of his nails running over her skin. She lowered her head to his chest and teased him with light kisses.

""Please, babe,"" she whispered, pleading. ""Can't you tell me?""

Caleb reached between them, caressing his wife's smooth stomach . His hands found her small, perky breasts. He squeezed and she moaned, wrapping her wings around him like a rough, warm blanket.

""What makes you think there's another woman?"" He asked, a mischieveous light on his face. He tweeked her dark nipples between his fingers. A high, quick gasp from Marini was his reward.

Head lolling back, she tried to think through the onrushing haze. ""No fair,"" she murmured, ""you know what that does to me.""

Caleb pinched them again, sending an electric tingle straight to her pussy. The scent of her arousal filled the air. She felt hot and ready and so very very empty. And he was merciless. His fingers were teasing, pinching, pulling at her nipples, changing it up from second to second, not giving her a chance to adapt.

""Now, what on Earth could give you the idea I'm seeing someone else?"" he asked, his voice dripping with sacarine sweetness. She gripped him hard to steady herself, nails digging in. He winced at the pain.

Marini managed to scrape together the discipline to look her husband right in the eye. ""I-I c-can smell, ah, her all oooOOOOOH! Over you,"" she managed before sagging forward, legs unable to hold her up. Caleb caught her, supporting her statuesque frame with strength that always surprised her.

""Please? Just tell me?"" she whispered into the curve of his shoulder.

Caleb nipped her ear, making her whimper. ""Well, alright, since you insist. Her name is Tomomi.""

Marini shuddered as a fresh wave of jealousy and lust washed over her. Her whole body tingled, electric and so deliciously alive. A bolt of heat shot down her belly straight to her empty pussy. Her hands gripped her husband's arms with all the strength she could muster.

Then just like that, Caleb plopped her on the bed, half-seated, half-lying.

Looking up at him where he stood over her, she found her eyes fixed to the proud bulge in his pants. She sat up in a flash, her hands running up his pantlegs, before reaching the marvelous bulge between his legs.

She sucked in a great gulp of air through her nose, drinking, luxuriating in his heavy scent. ""I bet she loved this,"" she said, fingers reaching for the button on his fly.

""She sure looked like she was having a good time,"" Caleb said, running a hand through her hair. He drew a small lazy circle around her petite horns;first the right, then the left.

Shivering under his ministrations, Marini pulled the tab on his fly all the way down. She seized and yanked his underwear down, revealing his cock.

The organ sprung free from confinement with a mind of its own. It slapped her across the face, leaving a trail of his clear precum. She greedily inhaled his musk, mixed with the unmistakable smell of another woman's sex. Closing her eyes, she nuzzled the hot bar of flesh and reveled in the heat flooding her face. His short pubic hairs, red as on his head, tickled her nose.

Wetting her lips and wrapping her soft hand around his prick, she played the tip of her tongue along one of his balls. She licked it all over, getting it good and wet, then took it in her mouth. Her hand on his shaft gingerly, playfully, stroked up and down.

Caleb feared he might fall over. He rocked on his heels, unsteadied by the sensations radiating from his wife's touch. Her hand was achingly soft, her mouth hot and wet on his skin as she went from on ball to its mate. His hands gripped her hair tight as he groaned.

His hips began to move on their own, thrusting against her hand. In and out it slid, smearing her fingers and palm with precum.

She released his balls with a loud 'Pop!'. She giggled, giving his shaft a squeeze and a few sharp pumps, making him gasp.

""Aww, what's the matter, big boy?"" she asked, ""Something else you want?""

""Y-your mouth,"" he managed between gasps. ""Put it in your mouth. Ahh!""

""What's the magic word?"" she asked, still with a wicked look on her face.

His big hand, covered in callouses, closed around a fistful of her hair and yanked. Yanked HARD. Marini's head pulled suddenly to one side. And her cunt exploded in sensation; she quivered, limp in her husband's hand, teetering on the edge of orgasm. her pussy fairly drooled.

Suddenly more horny than she'd been all night, Marini looked up at the towering man that was her husband, and said ""Yes, Sir,"" so softly she wasn't sure he'd heard. She parted her soft lips, a hint of saliva hanging between.

Then, with her eyes locked on her husband's wolfish smile, she slid her mouth over his cock. His flavor invaded her mouth. Her brain shut down, leaving the taste of his cock and his mistress her whole world.

She could just see them together. Caleb's powerful frame pushing his Japanese harlot into the mattress. Her mind could effortlessly imagine his big cock, THIS big cock in her mouth, plundering the other woman's soft folds. It would plunge right in, making her squeel and wimper; too much cock for her to handle.

Marini moaned around his hard shaft and cupped his balls, gently squeezing them. She lowered her head down his length, feeling every ridge and bump stroke her tongue. She kept going, even past the point where her throat screamed and churned, until her nose rested in his rust-red pubes. Her other hand found her cunt without her brain even noticing. She had two fingers deep inside before she realized what she was doing, and by then it was too late. It felt too good; her abused clit was hypersensitive, and every touch lit her skin on fire. She twitched and squirmed, her legs trying to come together and then splaying whorishly apart. The slightly bitter tang of her husband's mistress danced on her tastebuds.

She was in heaven. A paradise of the flesh.

Her lungs burned for air, and she released the prick. Gasping,the fingers in her cunt never stopping, she jerked the cock; fast and hard, the way he liked it. His whispered ""oh god"" made her shiver.

His fingers curled in her hair as he gasped. She slowed down her strokes. He sucked in a deep gulp of air and let it out on a ragged breath.

""You like that cock?"" he asked once he'd gotten hiswind back.

She nodded and went ""Uh-huh!"" without taking her eyes off his glorious shaft. She leaned in again and lay kisses all along the tender underside.

Right as she placed a kiss on the tip, his voice came again. ""Then you'll love this!"" Her head jerked forward. She flailed, her mouth opening as quickly as she could to keep from scraping her teeth on his flesh.

He yanked her head forward and back, his shaft plunging into her mouth over and over. She couldn't breathe. Her throat screamed every time his cock jabbed it. It was all she could do to grab his thighs for dear life. She'd become just a cock-sleeve for his pleasure.

It was exhilarating. She curled her tongue into an arch, dragging the top against his organ. He sucked air in through grit teeth; she took that as a good sign.

His grip shifted, taking hold of her horns now. His punishment of her throat and mouth doubled in earnest. A thin salty taste coated her tongue. He was close. Marini hummed around his cock in anticipation. Her wings and tail wrapped him tight.

With a roar, Caleb exploded in her mouth. The first burst of cum went straight down her throat. She gagged, to her disappointment. She was forced to release his spasming prick, coughing and gasping, even as the second shot landed right on her tongue.

Clamping her mouth closed to hold onto the precious cum, she fought the full-body cough to aim his cock at her chest. His shots coated her lips, dribbled down her chin, splashed against her neck, and finally onto her tits.

Caleb's marvelous cock slowed, dribbling more than shooting. Marini gave it a few more pumps, and was rewarded with more of his hot spunk on her chest. She hummed with contentment around her mouthful of semen. Her hands cupped her tits, hefting and weighing before sliding up. Her fingers caught the spunk, and smeared it.

The smearing, like jelly, only hot and pungent, made her moan. Her mouth opened just a crack, dribbling a more bit of her Master's seed onto her chest. She smeared that too, covering herself in his scent.

She looked up at him through lidded eyes. He looked back at her, red-faced and panting. Without taking her eyes off him, Marini made a show of swallowing all of his semen in her mouth.

""You're little piece on the side do that?"" she asked, her voice heavy and low.",,2025-08-15T19:06:17.530636,2595,
https://www.literotica.com/s/a-dark-future-ch-16,A Dark Future Ch. 16,Unknown Author,,,,,"Robert's afternoon is less busy than he thought. He hadn't missed anything while he was gone with Amber, and his only meeting that afternoon was canceled. After texting Jane to ask when she was available, he waits a bit, doing more research on vehicles for the afternoon, and lining up appointments to go to two car lots that evening to see the options. Eventually Jane texts back that she is rather busy, and that Lucia is going to come up to go over the various options they had identified.

Shortly afterward, Lucia texts to ask if she should come up with lunch for the talk. Given how slow work is, he decides to just go down, and take his work laptop. He gets settled at the breakfast table, and after Lucia takes a sandwich to Alexia, and Amber takes lunch to Jane, they finally settle down to eat together.

""So right now we have one good orange possible, and 4 other maybes?"" Robert asks. ""It sounds like we need to take 2 or 3.""

""That's what we had this morning. We've identified more possibilities that are new since the last time we looked at orange cards, as well as a few we skipped last time, that may be worth considering. We really need you to take a look, and see what you think."" Lucia says. ""The longer this goes on, the more I think Jane is right. We can't have half of the house not being part of the family. One or two skilled positions is one thing, maybe a teacher and a doctor, but if they don't have skills, they need to at least be an active participant, and that means you need to find them attractive.""

""I'm going to just stop arguing about this."" Robert says. ""I've lived long enough to know that I'm not going to win an argument against multiple women, and that even if I could, I'd regret it.""

""There is nothing wrong with having attractive girls."" Amber says. ""A girl should be beautiful for her Master. Choosing a girl who you cannot find beautiful is cruel.""

Robert sighs and shakes his head, deciding to just go with the insanity. ""I'm sure you are both right. So can you show me the new options first, and then the old options again?""

""Ok"" Lucia says. ""First up we have what I'm calling the cute girls.""

""The cute girls?"" Robert asks.

""Girls whose primary asset is being cute."" Lucia says. ""They don't necessarily have a skill set we would otherwise be looking for. So rather than focus on their profiles, just focus on the photo. If they aren't your type, let us know, and we can remove them. If they interest you, we will need Mistress Jane to interview them, and decide if they would be a good fit from a personality standpoint.""

Robert sighs, but takes the mouse, and goes through each one carefully, clicking into the profile despite Lucia's assurances, and blowing up the photo after reading the meager information available. When he is done, they have 8 'cute' girls left, all but one of which have brown or black hair.

""I think I'm noticing a pattern here."" Lucia says. ""Should we filter on that in the future?""

""No."" Robert says shortly. ""Even if someone isn't my ideal type, it doesn't mean they don't deserve consideration.""

Lucia just laughs, and says excitedly. ""Next we have two new girls with skills.""

She clicks on one profile, and continues. ""This is the vet. She's 27, and has been out of school for a year. I was able to find the website for the vet, and it appears she has worked at her father's practice since she graduated. As best we can tell, she is single, and I think she's pretty, if you don't mind a blonde.""

""I don't mind."" Robert says. ""Are you thinking vet for whenever we hopefully get some property?""

""Let's just say that Mistress Jane has a plan."" Lucia says, still excited. ""She could also help with human injuries and illnesses, it's not like what she knows about animals is totally useless when dealing with humans.""

""That's fair."" Robert says. ""She could be a good asset to have to help win over neighbors in a rural area too. We can put her as a possible, depending on how the interview goes. Who is the other one?""

""I'm calling this one the gardener."" Lucia says. ""She's 24, and it says she works at a plant nursery. I did some looking around, and I think it's this one."" Lucia pulls up a site for a nursery that appears to specialize in permaculture. ""I don't really know what that means, but Jane says you probably would.""

""It means we need to bid on her, if we are serious about getting property."" Robert says. ""Let's see her profile.""

""I wouldn't say she's pretty."" Lucia says, and then adds hopefully. ""But she's cute.""

""There is nothing wrong with her."" Robert says. The woman on the screen is cute, with brown hair, large glasses, and slightly chubby cheeks. ""I'd have guessed librarian instead of gardener though.""

""I can see that."" Lucia says, after turning the laptop around to look at it a bit longer. ""Are we calling her a possible, along with the vet?""

""Yes."" Robert says. ""And the teacher from before.""

""So we have 3 possibilities with skills, and 12 cute maybes..."" Lucia says. ""I've got to think you and Jane can find 2 or 3 out of that group that won't break the bank.""

""Definitely, as long as the interviews go ok."" Robert says. ""I guess you ladies can keep going through the reds, and hopefully find us some good options. Until we get through Saturday's auction though, I'm going to stay out of that.""

""That's fine."" Lucia says. ""We have our list for Saturday, I'll type it up, and send you and Jane a link for your phones during the auction. Do you want to put the cute maybes in a particular order?""

""We can do that during the interviews."" Robert says. ""I just hope the possibles go up for auction first, so that we can fall back on the maybes at the end if we need to. Otherwise we may have no choice but to bid on a maybe if they are going cheaply, just to make sure we end up with people on our list. On a different note, we need to go shopping tonight, both for a car, and for furniture. Are you all coming?""

""I think we should."" Lucia says. ""We can all help with the test drive, with that many seats it'll be nice to have someone in each row, to make sure we test everything.""

""Good idea."" Robert says. ""Amber, do you feel comfortable going?""

""I go where my Master wants me to go."" Amber says, and Robert sighs and drops it.

""What about Alexia?"" Robert asks.

""I don't see why she can't come."" Lucia says. ""Maybe check with Mistress Jane first.""

The evening rolls around, and Jane agrees that Alexia should come.

""We need to pick up furniture after we get a van."" Jane says. ""She can help us load, and unload, and she's the one that knows exactly what we need.""

The group piles into the car and heads to the car lot. There are two options, one of which is cheaper but much more plain, and the other of which is nicer, and more expensive.

""Let's test drive them both."" Jane says. ""Girls, try a few different seats. We are stuck with whatever we pick for years, so I need honest feedback.""

The first van was a bit loud and bumpy, and the bench seats were just not comfortable. The second was a little better, with individual seats, much less road noise, and better headroom. Robert and Jane take a few minutes to confer.

""The first one kind of sucks."" Robert says, ""But the second is really expensive.""

""They are both expensive, but if we are going to buy, we should buy the decent one."" Jane says. ""No point half-assing this.""

""You are right."" Robert says.

""I've moved the cash around so we don't need to worry about a loan."" Jane says. ""Let's just pay and get out of here, I don't want to be here all night.""

They manage to get out after just an hour of paperwork.

""Lucia and I are going to take our car, we have a few errands to run for tomorrow, and then we will get dinner."" Jane says. ""Alexia, direct Robert to the furniture store that has what you need. I expect perfect behavior from you, young lady. Amber, if you observe any behavior that I would not approve of, you are to text me immediately. Robert is too nice sometimes.""

""Yes, Mistress."" Amber says, having realized that Jane was the disciplinarian.

Jane and Lucia hop into the car, and head towards the sex shop.

""I can't wait to get home."" Lucia says. ""I hate wearing a collar.""

""I know."" Jane says. ""And I hate that you have to wear something you hate so much. Collars can be fun, but not when the person hates wearing it.""

A few minutes later they pull into the local sex shop.

""You've never been into one of these, right?"" Jane asks.

""I haven't."" Lucia says.

""Have your ID card ready, and stay near me. If anyone addresses you, I'll respond. Make sure you address me as Mistress."" Jane says. ""Hopefully the store is just about empty, and we can get in and out fast.""

The pair get out of the car, and Jane leads the way inside. The employee at the counter looks up, and begins to speak, but stops for a moment when she sees the collar on Lucia's neck. ""Is she a concubine?"" She asks.

""Yes."" Jane says. ""Do you need to see her ID?""

The woman sighs, and says. ""I guess? I have no idea what the rules are going to be moving forward, but she's definitely young enough to ID.""

Jane holds out her hand, and Lucia provides her ID. Walking over, she hands it to the employee.

""18 on the dot."" The employee says. ""Your husband must be happy.""

""I think he's very satisfied."" Jane says. ""Don't you, Lucia?""

Lucia blushes, and responds quietly. ""Yes, Mistress.""

""She's cute."" The employee says. ""So what brings you in?""

""I need to punish another one of my girls."" Jane says. ""I'm thinking of going with a humiliation based punishment, maybe putting animal ears and a tail on her, and treating her like an animal for a day.""

""Sounds fun."" The employee says, staring at Lucia. ""Not this one, though? I can't imagine her misbehaving.""

""She can be a handful when she wants to be."" Jane says with a smile. ""But she's not the one getting punished this time.""

""Well, we have a few options."" The employee says, coming around the counter. ""Any idea what animal? We've got a few options.""

""Something a bit humiliating."" Jane says. ""Pig ears and a curlicue tail would be hilarious.""

""I think we have the ears, but not the tail."" The employee says, digging around in a box at the bottom of the rack. ""This could work though."" She holds up a package with white and black spotted ears and a tail. ""Dairy cow. I think it was meant for Hucow cosplay, but it could definitely work. We may even have some body paint around here if you want to really commit.""

Jane looks at Lucia and asks. ""What do you think? Would Alexia hate it?""

""Absolutely, Mistress."" Lucia says. ""She will hate the body paint too.""

""If we do the body paint, you and Amber are going to do it."" Jane says. ""I don't have time to paint her.""

""Maybe we can do it in your office, while you watch, Mistress?"" Lucia says. ""Having you watch will keep her from complaining, and be more humiliating.""

""Ok, we'll take it."" Jane says.

""Anything else you need?"" The employee asks. ""We have a great selection of floggers and strap-ons. And I have some canes and whips in the back, for some of our special customers.""

""I think I'm covered for the floggers and strap-ons."" Jane says. ""I may come back for restraints in the future, but we have enough for now.""

After they reach the car, Lucia asks. ""Are all sex stores like that?""

""No, some of them have dirty old men at the counter who leer at you or act creepy the whole time."" Jane says. ""That's a decent store, even if it's not exactly high end.""

""Some of those toys can't possibly fit inside of someone, can they?"" Lucia says.

""You have a lot to learn."" Jane says, with a smile. ""Sometimes I forget how innocent you are.""

Grabbing dinner, they head back to the house, beating Robert, Alexia, and Amber, who show up a bit later with the furniture. Lucia sets the table, and Jane portions out the food onto four plates. As the second group enters, Jane says. ""I'm afraid we only have four seats. Luckily Alexia won't be eating just yet. Alexia, please empty the van, and then put everything where it goes. Once you are done, you may come find me for your dinner.""

As the four sit down to eat, Robert asks. ""Is this part of the punishment?""

""A very minor part."" Jane says. ""She is eating PB&J for every meal until Saturday morning.""

""What is the rest of it?"" Robert asks, not sure if he is suspicious because he thinks the punishment is going to be too harsh, or too lax.

""I'd really love it to be a surprise."" Jane says. ""I promise, it'll be worth it tomorrow morning when I show you.""

Robert just shakes his head, and digs into his food. A moment later, he says. ""I'll trust you. I'm doing a lot of that lately."" He laughs a bit at this.

Lucia chimes in deviously. ""Trust me, she will hate the punishment. And it won't hurt her.""

""Lucia came up with the idea."" Jane says. ""Although we aren't going to tell Alexia that.""

A minute or so later Alexia comes in, breathing a bit heavily, bringing in the first of the bar stools for the kitchen.

""Alexia, I think now is a good time for your apologies."" Jane says.

""Yes, Mistress."" Alexia says, and turns towards the table, looking Robert in the eye first, before kneeling. ""Master, I would like to apologize for my behavior this morning. Doing something that I knew would upset you is unacceptable behavior. I know I will be punished by Mistress Jane tomorrow, but if you wish to punish me yourself as well, I will accept it, if it helps for you to accept my apology.""

""Thank you, Alexia."" Robert says. ""I am going to wait to decide on whether to accept your offer until I see your punishment tomorrow.""

""Thank you, Master."" Alexia says. Turning her gaze to Amber, she says. ""Amber, I am so sorry. I took advantage of my authority over you, put you in a bad position, didn't get your consent, and didn't even think to ask if you were ok with a girl kissing you. If there is something I can do to make it up to you, or if you need to do something to get even with me, I understand. I hope we can be friends again, after my punishment.""

""We are already friends."" Amber says. ""I am not angry at you, I am a bit disappointed that you put us both in a position that could make Master and Mistress unhappy with us though.""

""Thank you, Amber."" Alexia says, bowing her head. ""I won't ever do that again.""

""I hope not."" Jane says, frowning at her.

""I also need to apologize to you, Mistress."" Alexia says, a single tear going down her cheek as her voice breaks a bit. ""I put you in a bad situation, and caused trouble in your house. I also betrayed the trust you put in me. I am so sorry, and I will work every day to regain your trust.""

""Good."" Jane says. ""I accept your apology. Fuck up like that again though, and the punishment tomorrow will look like funishment.""

""I understand, Mistress."" Alexia says. ""I promise, I won't.""

""Finish with your work then, and let me know when you are done. You can assemble the furniture on Saturday morning."" Jane says.

As the group finishes dinner, Alexia finally finishes taking up the pieces of the bunk bed, as well as the mattress. Approaching the table, she informs Jane.

""Well done."" Jane says. ""Are you hungry?""

""Yes, Mistress."" Amber says. ""I've been starving since before we left the house.""

""It does look like you've worked up an appetite."" Jane says. ""Stay here a moment, and I will get you something.""

Two minutes later Jane comes back with a sandwich. ""Here is your dinner."" Jane says. ""You may kneel in the corner to eat it. When you are done, please ensure the kitchen is clean, then shower, and then wait in your room for Amber and Lucia to go to bed. No snacks until Saturday morning. I expect you in my office at 7 am tomorrow to begin your punishment. Do not be late.""

""Yes, Mistress."" Alexia says, taking the sandwich and going to the corner to eat.

Jane can tell Robert is feeling bad for Alexia, and decides it's time for them to go upstairs. ""If everyone is done eating, maybe we can all go cuddle in bed and watch something.""

After one episode, Jane decides it's time for the girls to get ready for bed. ""Amber, you are going to be sleeping with Lucia and Alexia tonight. If you can't sleep, or are struggling, just wake Lucia and let her know. Lucia, if that happens, knock on our door and bring her to me."" Jane orders. ""Now off with you both, I need some Robert time.""

Jane rolls over in the bed to face Robert, and gives him a big kiss. ""I finally have you to myself for a night."" She says, smiling. After a few minutes of kissing, she gets up to get the shower ready. Robert follows her, grabbing some towels.

""So what's on the menu tonight?"" Robert asks, coming up from behind her and giving her a kiss while grinding against her ass.

""No anal."" Jane says. ""Other than that, we'll see after the shower.""

Robert laughs. ""I assumed no anal. Even I'm smart enough to know that you trained the girls for that early for a reason.""

""You are the smartest man I know."" Jane says. ""And it didn't take much convincing, if you can get Alexia to do something for you, Lucia will do it just to keep up.""

""So true."" Robert says, kissing Jane's neck. ""The water should be warm enough, let's get clean so we can get dirty.""

The pair take turns washing each other, rubbing each other sensually, until Robert turns off the shower. ""Enough of that, let's get to the bed.""

Drying each other off quickly, Robert positions Jane on edge of the bed before going to his knees, diving eagerly into her pussy. Jane gasps, Robert takes a moment to lick her from top to bottom, before attempting to fuck her pussy with his tongue. Moving back up to her clit, he flicks it with his tongue before sucking on it, and then does both at the same time.

""Stop, don't make me cum yet."" Jane says. ""It's my turn.""

""That was quick for you, have you been looking forward to this?"" Robert teases, flicking her clit again before moving up to get on the bed.

Jane doesn't answer, just giving him a little smile before moving between his legs on the bed, and leaning down to tease him.

""No teasing today, please honey."" Robert says. ""I know you love it, and you can tease the shit out of Alexia another day until she begs, but not tonight.""

Jane responds by quickly taking him into her mouth, going as deep as she can, before pulling back, and working on the head of his dick.

""That's it."" Robert groans.

Jane alternates between licks on the outside of his dick, taking as much as she can, and working on the head while stroking the shaft with her hands. After a few minutes she stops.

""Sorry, jaw is starting to hurt."" Jane says regretfully.

""You know you are supposed to stop before that happens."" Robert says. ""Get up here."" he pats the bed next to him, and kisses Jane as they embrace.

After a few minutes of making out, he moves down, kissing her neck, breasts, and then gives her pussy one big lick. Grabbing her hips, he pulls her back to the edge of the bed, moving his hands down to position her legs against his chest. Lining up his dick, he sinks into her, gradually working his length into her, before moving a bit faster. Reaching down, he rubs her clit a bit, and after about two minutes, he manages to snag the wand from her nightstand without pulling out of her.

""Use that before you start to get sore, honey."" Robert says, picking up the pace again.

A few seconds later Jane turns on the wand, holding it to her clit. She moans loudly, and begins twitching.

""I love it when you cum."" Robert says, encouraging her while speeding up just a bit. ""You are so sexy.""

A moment later Jane cums, legs clamping on Robert and making it difficult to move. He grabs the wand from her and holds it lightly in place, before slowly moving it further away, breaking contact completely as her orgasm is ending. When her legs relax he leans forward, kissing her gently, before pulling out, and rearranging her fully on the bed. He follows her onto the bed, cuddling her while she recovers.",,2025-08-15T19:06:24.331518,3672,

One thing about the Lodge that I always thought was part of the appeal for those that came to it, was the fact that it could fulfill so many specific purposes. Anya Taylor-Joy originally came because she wanted to be somewhere off the beaten path. Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner came because they wanted somewhere private to fuck each other, as did Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen. Emilia Clarke wanted some no-strings-attached sex without fear of the paparazzi getting photographic glimpses of her dating life. Natalie Dormer was invited by Emilia Clarke, purely on the basis that she knew Natalie Dormer loved sex and would have fun, and oh boy did she.

Natalie Dormer was the type of guest at the Lodge that I found hard to believe until we actually interacted for the first time. It's strange. You see these gorgeous women in films, tv, in photos on the red carpet, and you think to yourself that despite how gorgeous they are, there's no way they could ever live up to the fantasy you have in your head. Then I met Natalie Dormer, who knew exactly what she was getting into, and loved it. Sex with her was intense, to say the least.

But back to my original point, which was the reasons why they came to the Lodge in the first place. It was Natalie Dormer who brought up the subject of Jennifer Lawrence to me. Natalie and Jennifer, having met on the set of the Hunger Games sequels, had a special type of friendship. One that was based on them keeping each other apprised of their sex lives. Natalie showed me the text thread they had going. It went back years. They would text each other whenever one of them got laid, even if it was just regular sex with a boyfriend or something. Better yet, it got into detail about what they did. Some of the texts were very blunt, consisting of nothing but ""He ate me out, doggy style, I sucked his cock and he came."" or ""rode his cock to wake him up."" Some of them were more elaborate conversations about things like the female orgasm, tantric sex, what acts they considered degrading and wouldn't do (spoiler alert, there weren't many).

But, after the topic was originally brought up, Natalie got into more detail about it. Jennifer's problem in all her relationships? She had major jealousy issues. To the point that she didn't even want her boyfriends to watch porn, because then they'd be looking at another girl. Natalie and Jen had talked about it at length, and Jen knew that it was a problem she needed to finally get over. And so, Natalie and Jennifer brainstormed a solution that would help Jen work through the issue. As you might have guessed, it involved Jen coming to the Lodge. It also involved Natalie coming to the Lodge at the same time, but more on that later.

Natalie and Jen planned everything between themselves, and then ran it by me to make sure I was cool with it and I could play along. The way the plan was explained to me by Natalie was that Jen needed something akin to a roleplay to help her work through her feelings on the subject of her jealousy issues. So, we were going to act out a scenario where she was forced to confront these things head on. The plan was laid out with the following steps.

Step 1: Jen and I meet at the Lodge and make sure we hit it off and are comfortable doing this.

Step 2: Jen and I begin to ""play"" boyfriend and girlfriend. Pretending we're a happy couple. This helps Jen get into her role so the next part is more effective.

Step 3: Natalie comes in, playing the other woman that I ""cheat"" on Jen with.

It sounded so simple when put like that, but when the time came the actual interactions became much more complex. If you remember anything I previously mentioned about Jen, you might already have a sense of what this means. But I don't want to tell the whole story up front.

Jen came up on a Friday, when no one else was scheduled to arrive at the Lodge. I was waiting for her arrival at the time Natalie said she would get there, and right on time, I spotted a green jeep pulling up the driveway towards the house. As soon as Jen stepped out and I saw her in the flesh, I began to get even more excited than I was before. I took a long look at her as Jen looked up at the house, shifting her keys from hand to hand. She was wearing tight black jeans, gray sneakers, and a loose-fitting gray v-neck. Her blonde hair was let down, and left to its naturally curly state.

When I opened the door and waved, Jen immediately smiled and waved back. Then she quickly scooted forward toward me.

""Hi,"" she said with a genuinely genial smile. She walked right up to me, extending her arms before she got there, and then came in for a very friendly hug.

""Nat told me loads about you of course,"" she said as we pulled away.

""Under the circumstances, I'm glad she did,"" I said casually.

Jen's mouth cracked into a knowing smirk as she looked at me like she knew me, ""Yeah.""

She trailed off for a moment, seemingly in thought, until I guided her into the house. We walked inside, her jingling her keys back and forth between her hands as she looked around the entryway.

""Nice,"" was all she said as she walked in.

""Do you want to go somewhere? That we can talk?"" I said, for lack of a better idea.

""Yeah let's,"" Jen said as we started walking.

The two of us went to the lounge, where I poured from the first bottle Jen pointed at, making her a gin and tonic with lime, and myself a bourbon. Then, we both sat on barstools right next to each other, turning our heads to the side to talk to each other.

Then we started talking. Jen was so easy to talk to it was like we'd already met. We weren't even discussing what she was doing here yet, we were just shooting the shit about things like life in LA, where we had traveled to, what we do for fun, etc. We talked all through the first drink easily, never losing steam in the conversation. It was when the conversation turned to her filming X-men that things took a shift.

""And then I'll be done wearing that blue shit forever..."" Jen summed up as she began to take the final drink in her glass.

""Until you star in the live-action remake of the Smurfs,"" I said with just enough smarm to make her laugh. Jen snorted into her glass and had to take a second to keep herself from laughing her drink out of her mouth.

When she stopped laughing, she put her glass down, and then rested her head on her hand as she turned to look at me.

""You're cute,"" she said, not holding back her smile.

""You're cute,"" I said back with more insistence than she did.

We looked at each other a moment, and I could clearly see from the look on Jen's face the kind of thoughts that were running through her mind. She was sizing me up, combining what she was seeing now with the previous things she'd heard from Natalie. I was wondering which things that Natalie texted were in the forefront of her mind. Was Jen thinking she could ride my cock to multiple orgasms like Natalie once told her she did? Or did she want me to go down on her until her legs went numb, like Natalie texted another time?

""So you wanna do this?"" Jen said as she spun in her stool, pointing her whole body to face me.

""Very much,"" I said as I turned as well.

Jen slid forward on her stool, leaning forward as her hand came up to my chest.

""Sweet,"" was all she said as her hand grabbed the collar of my shirt and pulled it forward.

We leaned into each other and kissed, with Jen pressing her lips against mine really hard. She stepped forward and off her stool, standing up and pulling her body into mine. My arms wrapped around her waist as we kissed again, and Jen wrapped both arms around my shoulders. The kisses continued, as I began to move my hands around her back. After a few more, my hands slid down, and then began to run up and underneath her shirt, feeling the soft skin of her lower back.

""Mmm, hang on,"" Jen said as she talked between two more kisses.

We both stopped and looked at each other a second, and then Jen slid back a few inches.

""Let's hold off for a moment, so we can actually start this right,"" Jen said.

""Alright,"" I agreed.

Jen took a step back, releasing her arms from me and then smoothing her hair behind her shoulders. She still had that smile behind her eyes, advertising how excited she already was.

""Alright,"" she said, steadying herself. ""I'm gonna go out and come back in. When I come back in, we're officially in a relationship, got it?""

I nodded, ""Exactly.""

""K,"" Jen cracked another smile, and then turned and hustled out of the room.

I watched her leave, noting the shape of her ass in her jeans with some satisfaction, and then reached back behind the bar. I refilled my glass, and sat there, waiting for her to reappear. She stayed out for about a minute or so, and I wondered if she had actually gone as far as to actually go outside and reenter the entire house. How method was Jen's acting? I had no idea.

""Baby?"" I heard a voice call from the hallway. ""I'm home!""

""I'm in here!"" I called behind me, turning and looking to the door.

Jen reentered the lounge, seemingly having put herself in a more comfortable mindset. She had put her keys down, and she was also now barefoot. As soon as she saw me, her face turned right back into a big, beautiful smile. Jen quickly skipped across the lounge as I turned in my stool to face her, and soon we were right back where we were a minute ago, kissing while we were wrapped up in each other.

""You started happy hour without me?"" Jen said as she looked down at my glass.

""No, haven't touched it, I was just waiting for you."" I said with a wink.

""You jerk,"" Jen said with fake anger, snatching my glass and taking a sip.

""How was your day?"" I asked as my hands gently rubbed her back.

""Uneventful enough that I don't feel the need to talk about it,"" Jen said. Then her hands ran down my arms as she started to back up and pull me with her.

""At least I don't need to talk about it right now..."" Jen said as she began to pull me out of my stool. I got up and let her begin to lead me out of the room.

Once we were through the door of the lounge back into the foyer, Jen turned and gave me a very knowing look, biting her lip as she did. She stopped in her step, leaning back into me and planting another kiss on me as she did. Her hands reached over my chest, and then quickly down to my pants to feel my cock through them. Jen grinned as I slipped away and kept walking, taking the opportunity to take the lead to make sure we went the right direction to the bedroom. She quickly gave chase, and it turned into both of us practically racing to the bedroom.

Jen caught up with me right as I opened my bedroom door. Surprisingly, she came at me from behind, wrapping her arms around me and kissing me along the back of my neck and around to my ears. Her arms went down lower, wrapping around my stomach and then sliding underneath my shirt to feel my chest as we walked together into the room. She was half pulling it up when I turned around, and as soon as I did, she pulled it up and over my head entirely.

""Mmm, yeah,"" Jen said as she stared at my chest in appreciation.

She came at me again, pressing both hands against me as she almost literally pounced at me for another kiss. She pressed herself into me so hard I was taken aback for a moment, but then I saw the look in Jen's eyes and saw how into it she already was, and I joined in. I reached down and grabbed her by the backs of her thighs, hoisting her up and against me.

Jen let out a very excited gasp, and then wrapped her legs around me as she gripped my shoulders. She leaned down for another kiss, but was stopped by me pulling at her shirt. Jen immediately took the hint, and pulled her top up and over her head without a moment's hesitation or tease. A satin black bra was revealed as she leaned down and began kissing me again. I returned them as best I could as I walked us over to the bed, and finally sat Jen down at the end of it.

Jen landed on the bed with an excited bounce that tossed her hair in front of her face. I stood up straight again in front of her as she quickly fixed her hair back behind her ears. Once her hands were free, they went straight to my pants, opening them as she looked up at me with that same perky smile. My pants hit the floor before she even looked down, but Jen left the boxer-briefs I was wearing alone. She felt my quickly-hardening cock through them, and then turned around and crawled further onto the bed away from me.

I gave chase, just like I sensed she wanted, and got onto the bed after her. Just as she reached the top of the bed, I stopped her from moving further by grabbing the waistband of her jeans. Jen giggled and straightened herself up onto her knees as I closed in, and I pressed myself against her from behind. This time it was my turn to wrap my arms around her and touch her from behind. I let my hands run up her stomach, over her bra to feel her tits, and then back down to her pants.

Jen tipped her head back and exhaled with an aroused sigh as I began to kiss her along the neck again. My fingers grabbed her pants and opened them quickly. While one hand went back up to her tits to touch them through her bra, my other hand slid down inside her pants. I felt a pair of panties underneath, but I slid my hand underneath them to reach directly down to her pussy.

""Ohhh, baby, yeah..."" Jen gasped as she felt my fingers tease her pussy, and then turned her head back towards me to kiss while I touched her.

I let my fingers run over her pussy, not sliding inside it, but just rubbing over it a few times. Jen was already noticeably wet, and the few motions of my fingers left the tips of them wet. It also allowed me to notice how smooth Jen's pussy was, which was very, very smooth. Touching it with just my fingers, even before I saw it, had me really wanting to get my mouth on her as fast as possible.

Jen moaned sharply as my fingertips rubbed up her pussy to her clit, and then she looked at me with another grinning bite of her lip. She pulled my hand out of her pants, and then brought my fingers to her mouth, where she sucked the tips of each one with a very direct tease. When she was finished, she giggled to herself, and then fell forward onto the bed, bending over and then sliding down onto her stomach.

She didn't stay flat on her stomach for long, quickly whipping her hair to one side of her head as she turned to look to look back at me. She put her hands down like she was about to do a push-up, but then all that she pushed up was her ass, lifting her hips off the bad and putting it right up in front of me. I came closer again and hooking both hands around the waist of her jeans, and then began to work them down and off her hips. Jen's ass came into view, only partially covered by a pair of black panties.

Once I had yanked her jeans off the rest of the way, I leaned down to her again. I began to take my time. As I began to kiss along her exposed back to her hips, teasing that I was going to pull her panties off right there, Jen gave an excited, aroused sigh of appreciation. My hands groped over her ass and down to her thighs, touching her everywhere I could and making sure my hands got familiar with her body very fast.

The idea that we were 'playing' that we were in a relationship made this first encounter all the more interesting. In the 'script' we were to have amazing sexual chemistry, so I got to wondering if Jen was really enjoying this? Or was she just an amazing actress? I pushed the thought out of my mind for the moment as soon as I saw Jen turn around to face me as I straightened myself up.

Jen lay back on the bed, seductively running one of her feet against her other leg and showing off hot fit she was. I took a moment to appreciate the slightly thick but still athletic build she had, and how she looked in just her bra and panties. In one word, she looked amazing. As we locked eyes again, I bent back down and began to run my hands up her bare, smooth legs. Jen lifted one of them up, putting her foot against my chest and allowing me to run my hands along her calf up close.

""I love how you touch me,"" Jen said as she narrowed her eyes at me, intensely staring.

""I was about to start touching it another way,"" I said as my head went down and I began to kiss up her leg.

""No,"" Jen said as she pulled her leg away with a saucy glare.

""No?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

Jen sat up in bed, looking up at me again as she grabbed the waistband of my boxer-briefs, and teased pulling them away.

""No, it's my turn to go first today,"" she said.

Jen pulled my boxer-briefs down, letting my cock whip out and harden fully right in front of her face. She bit her lip as she stared, and then grabbed it with both hands. She lightly stroked it with just her fingers, and then I watched her lick her lips the entire way around in a slow circle as she leaned in.

""Lay down,"" she said as she pushed me back.

I did so, and Jen pulled my boxer-briefs off the rest of the way and then tossed them off the bed. Then, she sank onto her stomach between my legs, putting herself right above my cock as she looked down at it hungrily. There was a moment where she just stared, a pleased smirk on her face, as if she was feeling satisfaction in the moment that she owned my cock and it was all for her. Of course that was just part of the act, as I had fucked 2 other women this week already.

Jen put her fingers out, and touched the shaft of my cock with the tips of all of them. With the slightest touch, she tipped my cock towards her mouth, and then connected her lips to it. She parted them slightly, and then slid them over the tip in a slow motion. I watched her begin, and then she turned her eyes up to me as she stopped. As she kept her lips in the same place, holding the tip, I felt her tongue begin to circle it inside her mouth. She kept doing it, and then I saw her tongue slip outside her lips as her licks got wider and looser. She finally released her lips and then made an exaggerated licking motion all around the tip.

She finished circling the tip with her tongue, and then lowered her face to run her tongue up the entire shaft. After that, there was no more tease. Jen slid her mouth down onto my cock and then pushed herself down deep on it. I moaned from the initial feeling of going to far into her mouth, and she held it there for a moment until she brought both her hands to my cock as well. She began to pump my cock with her mouth and both hands, stroking it upward and letting her hands close over the tip before she slid down and put it back into her mouth.

The double motion of her both sucking and jerking was getting to me fast. Jen was not being shy about letting saliva roll off her tongue onto the tip of my cock, and every time she went back down her hands used it for more lubrication. I moaned a little louder, catching Jen's attention. She looked up at me again. Even with my cock still in her mouth, her eyes were smiling with excitement. She kept her eyes locked on me and her mouth halfway down my cock while she jerked with both hands.

""Fuck,"" I breathed out hard as she kept going. ""I love the way you suck my cock.""

Jen quickly lifted her mouth off my cock with a slurpy smack. She rolled her head to the side and brushed her blonde hair with it, and then looked up at me again with a giddy smile on her face.

""Do I need to stop?"" Jen asked as she just barely put the tip into her mouth and slid her tongue against it again. ""So I don't make you cum too fast again?""

""Just a little more, please,"" I said.

Jen giggled to herself and slid her mouth back over my cock again. This time she kept her hands off it, instead just sliding her mouth up and down. Even if she did make me cum, I knew I would be hard again in no time with the way she was going at it. Jen pumped her mouth up and down a few times, and then pushed herself up onto her knees. She delicately put her hands on her thighs and sat back, before she beckoned me up toward her. I got up and stood above her, my cock level with her mouth. Jen held her grin and then slowly opened her mouth while sticking her tongue out.",,2025-08-15T19:06:29.400926,3893,
https://www.literotica.com/s/grown-up-3,Grown Up,Unknown Author,,,,,"Cara flopped down onto a stool and surveyed the chaos of the apartment with dismay. It had happened again. Bella had done half a job with the bathroom and Eloise appeared to have merely drifted by the kitchen before both heading out the door with all their stuff in boxes. Cara vowed to herself that she'd find someone else to share with next year. She didn't need this level of shit to deal with on top of finals.

There was a knock at the door and her mood lifted.

""Cara, hon, you home?""

Cara skipped over to the door and opened it. A middle-aged woman stood in the hallway in a coat. Cara noticed she had leggings on and gym shoes and she smiled in relief at that. The cavalry had arrived and was prepared, as she always was, for the onslaught of end-of-term moving out.

""Daughter.""

""Mother.""

Cara stepped out and gave her mother a warm hug.

""Hi Cara.""

Cara turned towards the male voice and her buoyant mood evaporated.

""Hi Wade.""

He was in a coat too, stretched across his massive shoulders, easily a head higher than Cara's mother. He was sporting his usual three-day stubble, regarding her with dark, intense eyes. Wade extended a hand.

Cara looked down at it, feeling that little gut wrench when she spotted the wedding ring. She disengaged from her mother and shook the man's hand. As always, Wade's handshake was firm, enveloping her hand in his meaty grip, but perfunctory. She nodded to him.

""The place is still a bombsite. The girls just bolted, again.""

""It would have been better if you'd made them clean up first,"" Wade said.

""It would have been better if you'd have got here first, so I could leave them all to it.""

Wade didn't reply, but he shrugged. ""Rena, do you want to get started?""

Cara's mother nodded quickly, and then slipped past her daughter into the apartment. Cara turned to her step-father.

""You helping too?"" she asked.

""Oh, your mother and I have an arrangement. She'll help you with this, I'm doing all the driving and the carrying. Division of labour.""

Wade smiled amiably at her, but Cara felt the hairs rise on her neck. She bit off a response and went to find her mother.

Rena was in the bathroom, tutting. She took off her coat and folded it over her arm, then walked around to the kitchen, then inspected the bedrooms one by one.

""Darling, this might take a while.""

She hung up her coat on the back of the door and found a pair of rubber gloves.

""I'll give the bathroom another go while you finish packing your boxes, okay?""

Cara exchanged a look with her mother and then stared pointedly at Wade's back. Rena's expression flickered.

""Sooner started, sooner finished,"" she announced brightly and disappeared into the bathroom.

Cara returned to the slog of packing, watching her stepfather as he took up position on the same stool that Cara had been mooching on just a few minutes beforehand. He was on his phone, thumbs tapping the screen.

""Got a lot on?"" Cara enquired as she slid her shoes into a suitcase.

""I do,"" Wade murmured, his attention consumed by the screen.

""On the weekend?""

""Business never sleeps.""

That was all he said, tapping away at the phone. It looked like a toy in his huge hands. Cara continued her work, fuming silently, listening to the sounds of her mother hard at work scrubbing and cleaning.

Cara could see what her mother saw in Wade, why she'd married him. After Cara's father, it would have been flattering to be paid attention to by someone like her new stepfather. He ran his own business, and made enough money to give her mother a good life and a nice house after having to sell the family home in the divorce. Physically, he towered over his wife and Cara understood that too. The bulk of the man was intimidating. His features were not unhandsome, the stubbled chin suited him, and when he smiled he showed neat white teeth. But there was something about his eyes, the way they saw you, the dark chocolate colour. Cara had looked into those eyes; her mother hadn't stood a chance.

Not that the divorce was acrimonious, not that her mother had found herself lost and reeling. Quite the opposite: they'd kept it civil, at least as far as Cara had been able to see, split the assets and made the arrangements. With Cara now past the age of consent, there weren't even any custody issues. She suspected that her parents had waited for that moment, sending Cara off to college, to arrange the split.

It had taken a year for Wade to appear, another six months for him to pop the question and then another six months for her mother to walk down the aisle with him. Cara had been through a couple of boyfriends in that time, and she'd found herself in the position of telling her mother to slow down. She'd felt strangely foolish, saying that, giving her mother dating advice like she was the parent and her mother was the eighteen-year-old innocent. Something about that, about the divorce, had flipped the tables between mother and daughter, putting them on an equal footing and watching out for each other. Cara had warned her mother against Wade but had been roundly ignored.

She taped up a carboard box, making a show of it in front of her stepfather, but he seemed oblivious. Sure, he was better than sleeping alone, but there was something about him, about the way he treated Cara's mother, that just didn't sit right. It didn't seem very equal.

""Bit of help?"" she called out.

Wade looked up from his phone and slipped it into his jeans pocket. He stood up and came over to the packing box, taking off his coat to reveal a t-shirt underneath.

""Sure,"" he rumbled.

""Careful, it's....""

Wade hefted the box and turned for the front door.

""Heavy,"" she finished.

Cara skirted the big man to open the door for him. Her eyes settled on the way his biceps bulged with the strain, but he seemed to make light work of it. A strange thought flashed through her mind, of how he'd look carrying her mother like that, his wife pressed against his thick chest as she was transported lightly in his arms.

Wade stepped out into the hallway and headed towards the stairs. Cara found herself watching him go. She shook her head and darted back into the apartment.

That was the problem. He looked good in those jeans, stripped down to a t-shirt, probably even better naked. Her mother had settled for a man who could wrap her up in his arms, but in exchange for something else, something that made Cara uneasy.

Her mother had always been independent, running her life and her family, and it had been a formative part of Cara's life to see her mother in charge. Now, she was the opposite. Her mother was meekly scrubbing and cleaning while her new husband checked his emails. Cara snorted: the good little wife.

The worst part of it was that she'd be under the same roof until college started again. She was resigned to the fact that at some point or other in the next few weeks, she'd reach a tipping point and tell her mother what she really thought. It felt inevitable, but Cara was resolved to somehow prick the bubble and get her mother to see. Whatever Wade was giving her, he was also taking as well. Was it better to be with someone and under the thumb, or alone but free?

Her mother walked into the bedroom where Cara was just folding the last of her clothing into a suitcase. She'd stripped off the loose top, down to a t-shirt.

""Kitchen's done. Just need to vacuum,"" she announced breezily.

Cara didn't reply immediately, gawping at her mother, but Rena had already disappeared back into the lounge to fetch the vacuum cleaner. It wasn't her cheerful demeanour that had brought Cara to a sudden halt, it hadn't even been the fact that her mother was wearing a tight white t-shirt. No, it had been what was underneath the t-shirt.

Cara inherited her body shape from her mother: not overly tall, but slim, narrow hips, modest breasts. The image of her mother's cleavage pressed beneath the white t-shirt was burned into her memory. Cara was still standing in the middle of the floor unmoving when her mother returned and began to vacuum the floor.

She seemed oblivious to Cara's eyes on her as she tidied, tucking a strand of blonde hair behind her ear. The blonde colour wasn't a recent change; she'd gone blonde soon after meeting Wade, and had steadily grown out her hair from a neat bob to a lustrous ponytail that now sat between her shoulder blades. The hair had been the first trigger point for Cara. She'd noted it, and her mother had replied that Wade liked it that way. The woman she knew would never have just gone blonde because a man preferred her like that.

Now this; as Rena moved around, Cara found herself staring at her mother's front. She looked up, giving her daughter a smile, then stopped. She frowned, then clicked off the vacuum cleaner.

""What's up?""

""Uh, you tell me.""

Cara made a little circling motion with her finger. Rena looked down and began to blush.

""Oh. Yes. I guess... yeah, you probably want to know,"" she stuttered.

""Yeah. What the hell?""

Rena stood awkwardly in front of her daughter, clasping her hands. It had the effect of plumping her cleavage even further. She held eye contact with her daughter as her face coloured.

""What do you think, hon? How do I look?""

""Uh, you looked fine before.""

""Yeah, but now? Do I look more... uh.""

""Yeah, you look more. A lot more.""

Rena glanced towards the open doorway quickly, then replied in a low voice.

""I was going to tell you. I just didn't have the time. How do I look, hon? Does it look alright?""

""How many sizes did you go up? When did you get it done? Why?"" Cara hissed, keeping her own voice low too.

""I'm a D now. We talked about it, and I went in for the op a couple of months ago.""

""Did Wade talk you into this?"" Cara bristled.

""No, uh, we both agreed.""

""Whose idea was it?""

""Both of us.""

""But who brought it up?""

Cara glared at her mother, daring her to reply. Rena stayed silent.

""Thought so,"" Cara hissed.

Footsteps approached. Rena flicked on the vacuum cleaner again and resumed her work. Wade appeared at the doorway.

""Ready for the next load,"" he said.

""Here,"" Cara replied, zipping up the suitcase, ""Just this one then the box in the kitchen. Then we're done.""

""Okay. How about you baby? Nearly done?""

Cara cringed at the name, but her mother looked up brightly and nodded.

""Just the lounge area, then that's it.""

Cara's eyes were on her mother's face, seeing how eager she was to please. Her toes curled. She needed to get her mother on her own sooner rather than later.

""Okay,"" Wade replied, ""Wheels up in ten. Let's get on the road.""

---

They took a walk in the park, instead of a run.

""I just need to be careful for the next couple of months,"" her mother was telling her, ""No sudden movements, otherwise there could be complications, the surgeon said.""

Cara bit her lip. Rena was wearing running tights, same as her daughter, with a figure-hugging exercise top that accentuated her new, more substantial cleavage.

""You don't approve.""

Cara shook her head, facing her mother at last.

""Your body,"" she muttered.

""Hon, look, I was going to say something, but, y'know, I was all swelled after the op, so I've been waiting for everything to come good. It's come good, right?""

""You keep asking that. Why don't you ask Wade? He paid for them, yeah?""

""Don't be like that. It just makes you sound petty, Cara.""

For a moment, she sounded like the mother Cara remembered, the one who wouldn't hesitate to put her into place if she stepped out of line.

""I'm not being petty. I just don't see why you did it. Was it for him?""

""It's for me. You don't understand. One day you will, but you're too young. You'll get it.""

""He didn't push back though.""

""No.""

Cara hesitated. ""So, it was his idea.""

""No, it was mine.""

""Since when?""

""Since....""

""Since Wade. Just say it.""

""I don't know what you've got against him.""

""I've got nothing against him, so long as he's not....""

Rena's eyes narrowed, and they walked on for a while in silence. They left the park and turned for home, back to the new house that Wade had chosen. They crossed the street.

""He loves me, Cara. I love him too. It's not like your Dad, it's different. Wade's been so good for me.""

Cara's palms itched as she paced alongside her mother. They arrived at the house, but Cara didn't make a move down the pathway. She surveyed her mother, the changes that had been wrought over the last year or so. Rena looked better than Cara had ever recalled seeing her. She'd lost weight, slimming down and toning herself up. She looked good in the tight activewear, her blonde hair blowing in the breeze. But that was a problem.

""Cara, what is it?""

Cara sighed. She needed to get it off her chest.

""What I have against Wade is this. He's turning you into a bimbo. Look at you.""

Cara gestured towards her mother's lean body. She was surprised by the way her mother broke out into a smile, like it had been a compliment. There was a little sparkle in her eyes. Cara realised that she'd lost the argument, even without her mother saying anything more.

""A bimbo? Why, yes, I guess, "" her mother replied, doing a little twirl, ""It's the new me. Y'know what, hon? I like it.""

She turned on her heel and led her daughter into the house, the rounded curve of her bottom wiggling in her lycra tights. Cara could see what Wade saw in her mother, that much was obvious. She could also see what her mother saw in Wade. The big man was a commanding presence, effortlessly dominating the woman he'd married. Her mother was fulfilled in her life, and no doubt also fulfilled in the bedroom.

Wade was in the lounge, watching a show. Rena began to busy herself in the kitchen, putting together lunch for them all. She brought her husband a drink, her hand resting lightly on his shoulder, and that was as much as Cara could bear. She got up.

""Honey, are you going?"" her mother asked.

""Yeah, look, I still gotta get that run it. I'll be an hour.""

""What about lunch? I was just making it.""

""I'll grab something when I get back.""

""Okay. Have fun.""

""Yeah.""

Cara left the house, breaking into a light jog, but then building up until by the end of the street she was at full sprint. She came to a halt at the curb, bent over, gasping. It was all too much, like something out of the fifties. Her mother was in way over her head. Cara needed a plan.

She picked an easier pace, running back through the park and then down to the river, her mind freewheeling as she built up the distance between herself and her new stepfather. The way her mother had touched his shoulder giving him the drink made her shiver. As she tracked along the side of the water, she tried to pinpoint how it had made her feel, seeing that.

Was it because her mother had been blinded by love? Or was it something about Wade, the way he accepted her attentions like it was his right? Or was it something else? Cara grimaced, her skin cooling as the perspiration dripped down her back. She was running hard again, picking up pace without meaning to, as her brain worked through the possibilities. There was one other reason she felt like she did, and it left her cold. Cara could imagine how it would feel to touch him, feel his bulk under her fingers, the need for him. Cara's last boyfriend had been months ago. Yes, she could imagine what was going through her mother's mind very clearly.

Cara came to the little rise that looked out over the neighbourhood and stopped to catch her breath after the ascent. She wanted her mother to be happy, but this wasn't happiness. Wade had come into her life and filled it up, reshaping her as he wanted, and her mother had just let him. She needed help. She needed to be shown the man she really married. Cara would lift the veil over her eyes. She only had a few weeks before she'd need to return to college, so she had to work fast. Descending the hill, a plan began to form.

---

Wade was in the garage working out. They had two cars, but his spent its life on the concrete out front, one half of the double garage filled with weight benches and pull-up bars. Cara's mother was still at work, leaving her in the house with her stepfather. Cara rifled through her clothing drawer until she found what she wanted: her dark blue bikini. Quickly, she stripped off and put it on, conscious of the way it revealed her lean body. She checked herself in the mirror, plumping up her modest breasts, checking the straps were neat. She examined herself from the side, noting the curve of her bottom.

She had her mother's figure, but more toned. Of course, Cara no longer shared a breast size with her after her mother's augmentation, but that didn't matter. Cara tucked her long, auburn hair back into a ponytail. She was still going to make an impression.

Cara sidled into the garage, padding silently in her bare feet. Her skin was tingling, nervous at exposing so much skin to the man in front of her. Wade was oblivious, locking the weights onto the bar ready for another set of repetitions. He was stripped down too, sweating in tight exercise shorts and a baggy grey vest that revealed his thickly-muscled shoulders. Suddenly he looked up and saw her.

""Hi,"" she said, ""I just came to see what the noise was. I'm gonna catch some rays on the sun lounger. I've been spending too much time inside.""

It felt pathetic, but at least it was a story.

""Yeah, okay,"" Wade replied.

His eyes darted away from her, not making eye contact as he busied himself with the weights.

""You spend a lotta time in here, hey?"" Cara prompted.

Wade nodded, standing up and stretching his back, replying, ""Yeah.""

""Don't you ever have work to do?""

""Sure. I got a project meeting in an hour, then Rena's home, so I'm just squeezing in a few sets now before I have to get back to it. Helps the stress.""

""Maybe I should try.""

""Maybe. You ever done weights?""

""Nah. Gyms are usually full of stalkers, I've found.""

Cara let he comment drift between them. Wade didn't respond. She paced over to the rack of barbells and picked one up. She was conscious of turning her back on her stepfather, how her bikini bottoms cut into the cleft of her bottom. That tingling sensation increased, feeling his eyes on her body. Suddenly he was next to her.

""Heavy,"" she observed.

""Depends what you're doing,"" Wade told her. ""If you're building muscle, it's ideal. Or, if you're just trying to maintain tone, take a lighter one.""

Cara replaced the barbell and picked up a small one from the end. Wade was close to her now, the scent of his body in the air between them, an earthy musk. She hefted the small barbell experimentally.

""Feels like there's not much point to this one,"" she replied.

""Depends. For tone, it's the reps, for muscle it's the work.""

""So, I just stand here for an hour doing this?"" Cara laughed, bending and straightening her arm, ""While you lie over there and lift practically my entire bodyweight.""

She looked up at him, smiling, acutely aware of putting herself on display for the big man.

""Something like.""

""Is that how you got like this? Have you always worked out?""

Wade shrugged, hands on hips, looking down at her.

""I hit the weights a bit, and then when I met your mother.""

""What happened?""

""I hit it more. I bulked up.""

""For her, or for you?""

Wade grinned down at her but didn't answer immediately. Cara allowed the silence to lengthen between them.

""It's good to be in shape, Cara. Plus, your mother likes seeing me like this.""

""So you did this for her?""

Wade laughed, then pointed at the barbell in her hand.

""You done with that or you want to try out some other stuff?""

""Are you going to hone my body into shape?""

Wade shook his head, taking the weight from her and replacing it on the rack. Then, he turned away and went back to the weight bench.",,2025-08-15T19:06:34.665275,3574,

Who knew an Instagram friend request could be the harbinger of my destruction?

And yet, that is exactly the scenario I find myself contemplating, as I sit alone in my empty apartment. Frank's away for the whole weekend, and part of me thinks I should feel guilty: I'm basically cheating on him, with his ex wife's feet no less!

But that's not how my emotional self responds. The fact that Frank is absent is making things easier, not harder. He won't get hurt by what he doesn't know, and he won't act as an anchor to rescue me from my morbid curiosity, my newfound obsession.

The road that's led me here began so innocently. If I'd never caught sight of Frank's Instagram feed, with Holly's foot account smack dab in the middle of it... if I'd never started to obsess unhealthily over what a foot fetish even is... maybe I wouldn't have spent my hard-earned cash to buy Holly a new set of ankle boots.

But what's done is done. I could tell her I've changed my mind, to forget about the whole incident and cancel our plans to meet during the weekend, but I don't have it in me to pull away from the abyss.

So I stare at my phone again. Holly has sent me a friend request on Instagram... through her foot fetish account. Solemonarch. A brilliant pun, really, but also a concept that makes me shiver. I feel like a deer, stalked by a puma in the woods.

Once I accept her friend request, I'll know what she has in store for me this weekend. I'll know what the next step on this mad downward spiral is going to be. I'll know what she's going to do to me.

I'm not sure I'll like it... but I'm sure I want to find out what it is.

With a sense of anticipation, I close my eyes, and tap the ""accept"" button.

Moments later, my phone buzzes to a new notification -- Holly's already sent me a DM. I don't know what's happening to me, where all my confidence has gone, but I need to take a moment to breathe deep and literally stop my hands from trembling. Then, I open the message.

""Sorry Jenna, rain check! Smth came up, will let u know when I'm free"".

A horrible feeling of despondency and disappointment crashes over me like a tidal wave. No! So anticlimactic! I've been psyching myself up thinking about it for most of the day, why do I have to be so cruelly denied?

Frank will be back on Monday, too! I won't have the house to myself next weekend. Maybe that's a good thing...? Maybe having him around will let me keep a cooler head. Maybe he'll unknowingly save me, shame me into reneging on this mad fetish thing.

But do I really want to be saved?

I pace my room, considering what to respond, indeed whether to answer at all. I should just let it go, I know I should! This is the universe, granting me an opportunity to back out of my folly. Maybe my last opportunity. I really should seize it. But I haven't been able to stop myself so far, so why would I acquire such a skill now?

That's how I rationalise it, anyway. On some level, I know the truth is I have lost all self-control. Before I know it, I'm sitting on the bed, my fingers flying as I tap away at the screen.

""What's up, Holly?""

I'll give her this, at least she doesn't leave me hanging: the reply comes moments later.

""I'd really like to hang out, but a guy's paying 200 dollars to lick the bottoms of my shoes. U know the drill, work before pleasure!""

The words shock me to my core. The specifics really shouldn't surprise me at this point, not after the many sleepless nights spent researching foot fetishists, but the idea of a person being actually willing to pay 200 dollars just to lick the bottoms of someone's shoes is absolutely insane to me.

Insane, and... alluring.

I banish the thought, annoyed at the way my mind seems intent on betraying me. This isn't just about fetish anymore, this is about Holly, my partner's ex-wife, playing power games with me. I might be drunk with weakness and subservience, but I'm not stupid -- I recognise the words for what they are. A mockery of everything I believe in: honest work, earning your dues, taking control of your destiny.

But on another level... isn't Holly just better at this sort of grind than I ever will be? She's making more than I do in a full day at the office, by just having some guy lick her shoes like a dog. Like back at the mall, I once again squirm under the crushing perception of Holly's complete superiority over me. She has me beat in every department, brains, looks, money... even this.

I stare at nothing for a while as I go over these thoughts in my mind, again and again. It's just like with the foot fetish, I get a sniff at the idea and never let go. I basically programmed myself with seeing Holly's feet as an object of worship, and now I'm doing the same with the idea that she's my better, the alpha girl who deserves to get her shoes licked by losers... losers like me.

Oh God is the idea arousing me? But of course it is, because I'm a loser, meant to be a handmaid to the stronger girl... that's why she patted me on the head as I paid for her boots, it was a mutual recognition of my new standing beneath her...

My right hand sneaks into my pants, and as I start rubbing, my breath quickens. With every stroke, the poisonous thoughts sink deeper into my subconscious. Holly is better, smarter, prettier, wealthier. I am worthless, a doormat, a foot rag, a pay slut, a bootlicker, a lesser being, the kind of girl that can climax from merely fantasising about being bullied, let alone by her man's ex-wife, and oh God I'm getting close --

But eventually my phone buzzes again, snapping me out of my reverie. Holly has sent another message my way, and I cringe in humiliation as I realise how quickly I've interrupted my masturbatory session just to read what she has to say to me.

""Don't give me the cold shoulder now, girl. I'll happily cancel on the guy if u wanna pay me ""

I writhe on the bed at being called a girl by Frank's ex-wife, but it's the second half of the message that really grabs my attention. A part of me is so drawn to the idea that it actually scares me. Not only would I be living out my obsession, I would be paying Holly my tributes. Like an inferior person, a humble peasant, would do to her sovereign... perhaps more appropriately, to her sole monarch.

Besides, is it really that different from buying her ankle boots at the store? For that matter, I also directly paid her to purchase a photo set from her.

And yet, I hesitate. Holly doesn't know I paid for the photos, but she obviously would know if I paid to meet her. And the boots can be explained away as a gift, which shoe-licking for money definitely can't. This is too much, even for obsessive old me, at least for the time being. I'm going to draw a line in the sand, right here, right now.

""Sorry, was making tea,"" I say, making up a completely honest explanation for leaving her on read for a while. ""Not interested in paying tbh. Just let me know when you're free again!""

""Could have fooled me, after you bought the boots for me, but alright!"" Holly replies. ""Try not to think abt me too hard... if you can help it :P""

Her parting jab irks me. She's right, of course, I did pay for her shoes. In a way, that was my very first act of submission and impropriety towards her, so why was I acting all high and mighty now? I guess a primitive part of my brain still feels like it would be crossing a line, though. If I buy her shoes, then that is a gift. If I pay to lick her shoes (such a delightfully wrong idea), then it's basically... I don't know, sex work, I guess? It's a bit weird to consider. This fetish world is still very much new to me.

I'm tempted to finish my pleasure session, but... in truth, I'm scared of what I might do once close to the edge. What if I grab my phone one-handed and tell Holly I'll pay? The daze of arousal does wonders, and terrors, to the human mind.

No, best not. When Frank is here, I can get relief in a more conventional way, or so I tell myself as I start working through a few house chores. I feel really proud of myself for having enforced this boundary with Holly. I'll need to figure things out from here, of course. It looks like the meeting with her is still on, but the logistics will need some consideration once Frank returns.

But still, I beam in some measure of self-confidence, for maybe the first time since I discovered Holly's secret Insta account. It's good that I've done this, that I've said no.

Right?

I try to ignore and suppress the feeling of disappointment about the empty weekend ahead of me. But once all the chores are done, all the food is cooked, and all the tasks for the upcoming work week have been listed and organised, the dreaded emptiness becomes an experience of pure agony.

I keep myself distracted as best I can. I listen to some music, go for a run, try to read -- and fail, try to watch some Netflix -- and fail. My mind is elsewhere. Just when I think I'm finally getting immersed in something else, getting the distraction I so obviously crave, I find my hand fishing out my phone and tapping on Insta, looking for my sole monarch. Ugh, it's like a damn reflex at this point.

Has Holly already gotten her shoes licked, or is that still to come, perhaps later tonight? Is it happening right now? Has she posted any new pics? I refresh my feed obsessively, and eventually navigate to her fetish profile, browsing the gallery I've gained such an intimate familiarity with at this point.

I can kinda see why Frank thought she was beautiful. After staring at them long enough -- and programming myself to that effect - Holly's foot pics are starting to make sense to me. To be more accurate, I think the beauty is literally in the mind of the beholder, but then again that is true of every human body part, right? Even our more conventionally attractive anatomy is so only because we find it attractive in the first place.

The same is true for feet. Our brain over-interprets patterns all the time. It bestows meaning, symmetry, and parallels on the world around it, even when they're absent. Where first I saw just a pair of feet, I now see glory.

The delicate pose of Holly's foot as the toes press down on a slave's throat, and the naked heel rising defiantly into the air, begging to be sucked, speak of raw primal power, dressed in the fineries of queendom.

The matter-of-fact, arrogant way in which her flat sole fully adheres to another submissive's face, on the other hand, communicates contempt and degradation. Walking all over someone, merely because she can.

Every photo in this gallery speaks to my pattern-seeking brain. It evokes imagery from nature, history, and art, in one grand tapestry of inequality, hierarchy, and subjugation. And on some level, I realise it's training me to associate Holly, and Holly's feet, with the ability to rule. To enslave. To destroy.

As I try to snap out of my reverie, a new batch of photos comes in -- but not of Holly's feet, as I was expecting. No, I suddenly find myself staring at a gallery of old shoes, Holly's, I presume. Sandals, worn birkenstocks, and flip-flops being put for sale, at a price much higher than the retail pricepoint when they were new. Holly's greed is truly boundless! She'll literally make a profit off her worn shoes, in the full knowledge that fetishists will pay extra, just because the shoes used to belong to solemonarch.

Fetishists like me, I realise, and blood rushes to my cheeks in embarassment.

The photos make it quite clear that the shoes are being resold exclusively for their kinky value. No pair I see is in remotely good condition. The worst of the lot is a pair of old, worn sandals. Even from Holly's rudimentary and shoddy pics, it is clear they are stained with countless hours of her foot sweat. The way my face should be.

I should buy the sandals.

I don't know why I get these intrusive thought, but they cut through my mind like a knife through butter. My face should be stained with Holly's sweat. I should buy her used sandals.

Why on Earth would I ever do something like that, though? I literally just said no to paying her. But I did buy her boots. But this is different! I can concoct an excuse to make it acceptable in public -- and perhaps even to Frank -- that I felt like getting Holly a gift, but buying a pair of worn, frankly worse for wear, sweat-stained sandals from her secret fetish identity is literally impossible to explain away.

Even so, I want to buy them. Because I was so hyped for the weekend, and nothing happened, and anything's better than being swallowed by the maw of Sunday boredom and disappointment. Besides, she won't know it was me, just like she didn't know I purchased a set of premium foot pics from her, back when I still believed this was all a matter of curiosity, rather than attraction.

Ultimately, I should buy the sandals because I clearly want to. Because the idea of shoving my face against the insole and breathing Holly's sweat in -- while literally paying for the privilege -- arouses me to no end.

Before I know it, one hand slides back inside my pants, the other tapping away through Holly's links until my finger is hovering over the ""buy"" button.

I know I'm caught in the spires of my own arousal, but I don't care. Hell, I've already bought her ankle boots, this is no different, really. And it's not like paying her to cancel on the shoe-licking guy. She won't know I'm paying her. The boundary is maintained, but I still get to indulge my new obsession, and play with her sandals. Win win!

I throw my hesitations out the window. Millions of people in the world indulge these fetishes on a daily basis. I'll be one of them! I'll throw my hard-earned money, and my humiliated worship, at Holly, my new owner, my sole monarch. I finally tick the box, agreeing to pay extra for swift delivery, and purchase Holly's worn sandals. And simultaneously, I orgasm.

Pleasure washes over me in waves, so hard that my eyes roll back into my skull. I moan and whimper as the muscles in my thighs go taut and my toes curl and stretch. A striking realisation pierces the hazy fog and hits me -- I've never orgasmed so hard, not in my entire life. Throwing money at Holly for just being herself is the single most arousing thing I've ever done.

Unfortunately, with the pleasure receding, the crash comes soon after. My heart twists with guilt at how I'm betraying Frank's trust in me. I feel terrible shame and regret at my abasement before Holly, and the arousal it brings me. I tell myself I'll stop. I'll get the sandals, play with them when I'm alone, but that will be it.

But as Saturday turns to Sunday, I find myself browsing Holly's foot pics once again. I'm too aroused to properly appreciate the shame I feel at my failure, my pathetically weak will.

Frank calls me upon getting to the airport on Sunday evening. He's headed for his apartment tonight -- has to unpack his bags and get an early start at work tomorrow -- so we chat for a while, as he tells me about his weekend. I only half-listen, going through the motions of the conversation. My thoughts are with the package that will soon be heading towards me. The sandals I ordered. The tangible proof of my licentious impulses.

I can't exactly give them back, but I could throw them away, I suppose. I tell myself I'll at least consider doing that, but I know I'm lying to myself. I'm fully into the orbit of my obsession now, and I don't have it in me to pull away.

When the sandals do get home, on Wednesday, it's like Christmas has come again. I don't even change for work, don't even call Frank to ask about his day -- both things can wait. Right now, I have a fetish to indulge.

I take the box to my room, sit cross-legged before it, and ever so gently begin to peel it open. I feel there have been last-gen consoles, precious jewellery and sundry other luxury gifts unboxened with far less anticipation and care than I'm reserving this battered pair of sandals.

But as I finally pull them from the packaging, I know for a fact that it was all worth it.

They're rough to the touch, somewhat misshapen in places, worn out in others, and even at arm's length, they reek of foot sweat. I bring them closer to my face, losing myself in the tactile sensationsl. My mind revels in the idea that Holly has walked hundreds of hours in these shoes, breaking them in, like she does with people. Rubbing her foot scent, her sweat, and her weight into them, also as she does with people.

I never thought about shoes with any particular interest, but these sandals are different. They are a vessel of Holly's victory over me, and the psychological effect they have on me is devastating. Before I know it, I'm rubbing my face against every inch of them like a cat, except I'm not marking them with my scent -- they're marking me with Holly's. I slowly massage as much sweat as I can glean off them into my skin. Absurdly, it feels like a badge of pride.

Before I know it, the rubbing becomes kissing, licking, sucking. My original question -- the one that set me along this path -- has now been answered. As my tongue reverently laps at the sweaty insole, I understand foot fetishists completely. I am one of them, after all, and making out with an old pair of sandals with more passion than I ever mustered for my conventional lovers.

I lie flat on the ground, pretending Holly is standing above me and pressing her sandals into my face. I give myself to the sandals, worshipping every inch of them, as my right hand inevitably finds its way down my body and towards my arousal.

The evening goes by in a frenzy, the world forgotten.

If I really ever thought getting the sandals was going to be the end of my problems, the next few days prove I was sadly mistaken. I'm distracted at work, daydreaming about Holly's feet. I'm distracted with Frank, to the point that I'm forced to tell him work is taking a toll on me -- which he believes, the sweetheart that he is. Perhaps my biggest problem is that the sandals alone are not enough.

I want more.

And a new opportunity is coming up: for the second weekend in a row, Frank will be away on a work event. He's super apologetic as he tells me, but internally, I'm overjoyed, and I make sure to tell Holly right away. Hopefully I won't have to compete with paying shoe-lickers this time around.

""My, my, aren't you eager,"" Holly texts me in response.

""Cmon,"" I type, so fast that it makes me feel dizzy. ""I know you had fun too.""

""Hey, you're the newb here, Jen. Me, I've been having fun with feet for years. You're nothing special :P""

Before I can come up with a reply, she's typing again. ""That said, I do have to admit: I never expected I'd be patting Frank's new girl on the head like she's a pet ""

I gulp, loins afire, humiliation coursing through my veins. But Holly isn't done with me.

""You even bought me shoes. What kinda loser does that? :P""

If only she knew to what lows I've fallen over the past week... I'd never live that down. Still, I try to shift the conversation away from the teasing, and back to what actually matters. I've only gotten the one opportunity to act out my submissiveness with her, back at the mall, and I know so much more about myself now. I'm dead-set, I want to meet her.

""So are you free this WE or what?""

I count my rapidly accelerating heartbeats in anticipation of the coming response. I fully expect it, and yet when my phone does buzz, it startles me so much I nearly drop it.

""Ehh, I don't know. If you hope to compete with all the guys who pay me for my time, you're going to have to step up to the plate, missy.""

This last message catches me particularly off-guard. Mere days ago I would have disregarded it as her gold-digging self manifesting, but the truth is, thrice now I have financially supported her in some ways: I've bought her pics, gifted her boots, and paid to worship her old sandals. If I do want more -- and that is clearly the case -- then there is only one logical way this road can continue.

Chapter 2: Circling The Flame

Who knew an Instagram friend request could be the harbinger of my destruction?

And yet, that is exactly the scenario I find myself contemplating, as I sit alone in my empty apartment. Frank's away for the whole weekend, and part of me thinks I should feel guilty: I'm basically cheating on him, with his ex wife's feet no less!

But that's not how my emotional self responds. The fact that Frank is absent is making things easier, not harder. He won't get hurt by what he doesn't know, and he won't act as an anchor to rescue me from my morbid curiosity, my newfound obsession.

But what's done is done. I could tell her I've changed my mind, to forget about the whole incident and cancel our plans to meet during the weekend, but I don't have it in me to pull away from the abyss.

So I stare at my phone again. Holly has sent me a friend request on Instagram... through her foot fetish account. Solemonarch. A brilliant pun, really, but also a concept that makes me shiver. I feel like a deer, stalked by a puma in the woods.

Once I accept her friend request, I'll know what she has in store for me this weekend. I'll know what the next step on this mad downward spiral is going to be. I'll know what she's going to do to me.

I'm not sure I'll like it... but I'm sure I want to find out what it is.

With a sense of anticipation, I close my eyes, and tap the ""accept"" button.

Moments later, my phone buzzes to a new notification -- Holly's already sent me a DM. I don't know what's happening to me, where all my confidence has gone, but I need to take a moment to breathe deep and literally stop my hands from trembling. Then, I open the message.

""Sorry Jenna, rain check! Smth came up, will let u know when I'm free"".

A horrible feeling of despondency and disappointment crashes over me like a tidal wave. No! So anticlimactic! I've been psyching myself up thinking about it for most of the day, why do I have to be so cruelly denied?

Frank will be back on Monday, too! I won't have the house to myself next weekend. Maybe that's a good thing...? Maybe having him around will let me keep a cooler head. Maybe he'll unknowingly save me, shame me into reneging on this mad fetish thing.

But do I really want to be saved?

I pace my room, considering what to respond, indeed whether to answer at all. I should just let it go, I know I should! This is the universe, granting me an opportunity to back out of my folly. Maybe my last opportunity. I really should seize it. But I haven't been able to stop myself so far, so why would I acquire such a skill now?

That's how I rationalise it, anyway. On some level, I know the truth is I have lost all self-control. Before I know it, I'm sitting on the bed, my fingers flying as I tap away at the screen.

""What's up, Holly?""

I'll give her this, at least she doesn't leave me hanging: the reply comes moments later.

""I'd really like to hang out, but a guy's paying 200 dollars to lick the bottoms of my shoes. U know the drill, work before pleasure!""

The words shock me to my core. The specifics really shouldn't surprise me at this point, not after the many sleepless nights spent researching foot fetishists, but the idea of a person being actually willing to pay 200 dollars just to lick the bottoms of someone's shoes is absolutely insane to me.

Insane, and... alluring.

I banish the thought, annoyed at the way my mind seems intent on betraying me. This isn't just about fetish anymore, this is about Holly, my partner's ex-wife, playing power games with me. I might be drunk with weakness and subservience, but I'm not stupid -- I recognise the words for what they are. A mockery of everything I believe in: honest work, earning your dues, taking control of your destiny.

But on another level... isn't Holly just better at this sort of grind than I ever will be? She's making more than I do in a full day at the office, by just having some guy lick her shoes like a dog. Like back at the mall, I once again squirm under the crushing perception of Holly's complete superiority over me. She has me beat in every department, brains, looks, money... even this.

I stare at nothing for a while as I go over these thoughts in my mind, again and again. It's just like with the foot fetish, I get a sniff at the idea and never let go. I basically programmed myself with seeing Holly's feet as an object of worship, and now I'm doing the same with the idea that she's my better, the alpha girl who deserves to get her shoes licked by losers... losers like me.

Oh God is the idea arousing me? But of course it is, because I'm a loser, meant to be a handmaid to the stronger girl... that's why she patted me on the head as I paid for her boots, it was a mutual recognition of my new standing beneath her...

My right hand sneaks into my pants, and as I start rubbing, my breath quickens. With every stroke, the poisonous thoughts sink deeper into my subconscious. Holly is better, smarter, prettier, wealthier. I am worthless, a doormat, a foot rag, a pay slut, a bootlicker, a lesser being, the kind of girl that can climax from merely fantasising about being bullied, let alone by her man's ex-wife, and oh God I'm getting close --

But eventually my phone buzzes again, snapping me out of my reverie. Holly has sent another message my way, and I cringe in humiliation as I realise how quickly I've interrupted my masturbatory session just to read what she has to say to me.

""Don't give me the cold shoulder now, girl. I'll happily cancel on the guy if u wanna pay me ""

I writhe on the bed at being called a girl by Frank's ex-wife, but it's the second half of the message that really grabs my attention. A part of me is so drawn to the idea that it actually scares me. Not only would I be living out my obsession, I would be paying Holly my tributes. Like an inferior person, a humble peasant, would do to her sovereign... perhaps more appropriately, to her sole monarch.

Besides, is it really that different from buying her ankle boots at the store? For that matter, I also directly paid her to purchase a photo set from her.

And yet, I hesitate. Holly doesn't know I paid for the photos, but she obviously would know if I paid to meet her. And the boots can be explained away as a gift, which shoe-licking for money definitely can't. This is too much, even for obsessive old me, at least for the time being. I'm going to draw a line in the sand, right here, right now.

""Sorry, was making tea,"" I say, making up a completely honest explanation for leaving her on read for a while. ""Not interested in paying tbh. Just let me know when you're free again!""

""Could have fooled me, after you bought the boots for me, but alright!"" Holly replies. ""Try not to think abt me too hard... if you can help it :P""

Her parting jab irks me. She's right, of course, I did pay for her shoes. In a way, that was my very first act of submission and impropriety towards her, so why was I acting all high and mighty now? I guess a primitive part of my brain still feels like it would be crossing a line, though. If I buy her shoes, then that is a gift. If I pay to lick her shoes (such a delightfully wrong idea), then it's basically... I don't know, sex work, I guess? It's a bit weird to consider. This fetish world is still very much new to me.

I'm tempted to finish my pleasure session, but... in truth, I'm scared of what I might do once close to the edge. What if I grab my phone one-handed and tell Holly I'll pay? The daze of arousal does wonders, and terrors, to the human mind.

No, best not. When Frank is here, I can get relief in a more conventional way, or so I tell myself as I start working through a few house chores. I feel really proud of myself for having enforced this boundary with Holly. I'll need to figure things out from here, of course. It looks like the meeting with her is still on, but the logistics will need some consideration once Frank returns.

But still, I beam in some measure of self-confidence, for maybe the first time since I discovered Holly's secret Insta account. It's good that I've done this, that I've said no.

Right?

I try to ignore and suppress the feeling of disappointment about the empty weekend ahead of me. But once all the chores are done, all the food is cooked, and all the tasks for the upcoming work week have been listed and organised, the dreaded emptiness becomes an experience of pure agony.

I keep myself distracted as best I can. I listen to some music, go for a run, try to read -- and fail, try to watch some Netflix -- and fail. My mind is elsewhere. Just when I think I'm finally getting immersed in something else, getting the distraction I so obviously crave, I find my hand fishing out my phone and tapping on Insta, looking for my sole monarch. Ugh, it's like a damn reflex at this point.

Has Holly already gotten her shoes licked, or is that still to come, perhaps later tonight? Is it happening right now? Has she posted any new pics? I refresh my feed obsessively, and eventually navigate to her fetish profile, browsing the gallery I've gained such an intimate familiarity with at this point.

I can kinda see why Frank thought she was beautiful. After staring at them long enough -- and programming myself to that effect - Holly's foot pics are starting to make sense to me. To be more accurate, I think the beauty is literally in the mind of the beholder, but then again that is true of every human body part, right? Even our more conventionally attractive anatomy is so only because we find it attractive in the first place.

The same is true for feet. Our brain over-interprets patterns all the time. It bestows meaning, symmetry, and parallels on the world around it, even when they're absent. Where first I saw just a pair of feet, I now see glory.

The delicate pose of Holly's foot as the toes press down on a slave's throat, and the naked heel rising defiantly into the air, begging to be sucked, speak of raw primal power, dressed in the fineries of queendom.

The matter-of-fact, arrogant way in which her flat sole fully adheres to another submissive's face, on the other hand, communicates contempt and degradation. Walking all over someone, merely because she can.

Every photo in this gallery speaks to my pattern-seeking brain. It evokes imagery from nature, history, and art, in one grand tapestry of inequality, hierarchy, and subjugation. And on some level, I realise it's training me to associate Holly, and Holly's feet, with the ability to rule. To enslave. To destroy.

As I try to snap out of my reverie, a new batch of photos comes in -- but not of Holly's feet, as I was expecting. No, I suddenly find myself staring at a gallery of old shoes, Holly's, I presume. Sandals, worn birkenstocks, and flip-flops being put for sale, at a price much higher than the retail pricepoint when they were new. Holly's greed is truly boundless! She'll literally make a profit off her worn shoes, in the full knowledge that fetishists will pay extra, just because the shoes used to belong to solemonarch.

Fetishists like me, I realise, and blood rushes to my cheeks in embarassment.

The photos make it quite clear that the shoes are being resold exclusively for their kinky value. No pair I see is in remotely good condition. The worst of the lot is a pair of old, worn sandals. Even from Holly's rudimentary and shoddy pics, it is clear they are stained with countless hours of her foot sweat. The way my face should be.

I should buy the sandals.

I don't know why I get these intrusive thought, but they cut through my mind like a knife through butter. My face should be stained with Holly's sweat. I should buy her used sandals.

Why on Earth would I ever do something like that, though? I literally just said no to paying her. But I did buy her boots. But this is different! I can concoct an excuse to make it acceptable in public -- and perhaps even to Frank -- that I felt like getting Holly a gift, but buying a pair of worn, frankly worse for wear, sweat-stained sandals from her secret fetish identity is literally impossible to explain away.

Even so, I want to buy them. Because I was so hyped for the weekend, and nothing happened, and anything's better than being swallowed by the maw of Sunday boredom and disappointment. Besides, she won't know it was me, just like she didn't know I purchased a set of premium foot pics from her, back when I still believed this was all a matter of curiosity, rather than attraction.

Ultimately, I should buy the sandals because I clearly want to. Because the idea of shoving my face against the insole and breathing Holly's sweat in -- while literally paying for the privilege -- arouses me to no end.

Before I know it, one hand slides back inside my pants, the other tapping away through Holly's links until my finger is hovering over the ""buy"" button.

I know I'm caught in the spires of my own arousal, but I don't care. Hell, I've already bought her ankle boots, this is no different, really. And it's not like paying her to cancel on the shoe-licking guy. She won't know I'm paying her. The boundary is maintained, but I still get to indulge my new obsession, and play with her sandals. Win win!

I throw my hesitations out the window. Millions of people in the world indulge these fetishes on a daily basis. I'll be one of them! I'll throw my hard-earned money, and my humiliated worship, at Holly, my new owner, my sole monarch. I finally tick the box, agreeing to pay extra for swift delivery, and purchase Holly's worn sandals. And simultaneously, I orgasm.

Pleasure washes over me in waves, so hard that my eyes roll back into my skull. I moan and whimper as the muscles in my thighs go taut and my toes curl and stretch. A striking realisation pierces the hazy fog and hits me -- I've never orgasmed so hard, not in my entire life. Throwing money at Holly for just being herself is the single most arousing thing I've ever done.

Unfortunately, with the pleasure receding, the crash comes soon after. My heart twists with guilt at how I'm betraying Frank's trust in me. I feel terrible shame and regret at my abasement before Holly, and the arousal it brings me. I tell myself I'll stop. I'll get the sandals, play with them when I'm alone, but that will be it.

But as Saturday turns to Sunday, I find myself browsing Holly's foot pics once again. I'm too aroused to properly appreciate the shame I feel at my failure, my pathetically weak will.

Frank calls me upon getting to the airport on Sunday evening. He's headed for his apartment tonight -- has to unpack his bags and get an early start at work tomorrow -- so we chat for a while, as he tells me about his weekend. I only half-listen, going through the motions of the conversation. My thoughts are with the package that will soon be heading towards me. The sandals I ordered. The tangible proof of my licentious impulses.

I can't exactly give them back, but I could throw them away, I suppose. I tell myself I'll at least consider doing that, but I know I'm lying to myself. I'm fully into the orbit of my obsession now, and I don't have it in me to pull away.

When the sandals do get home, on Wednesday, it's like Christmas has come again. I don't even change for work, don't even call Frank to ask about his day -- both things can wait. Right now, I have a fetish to indulge.

I take the box to my room, sit cross-legged before it, and ever so gently begin to peel it open. I feel there have been last-gen consoles, precious jewellery and sundry other luxury gifts unboxened with far less anticipation and care than I'm reserving this battered pair of sandals.

But as I finally pull them from the packaging, I know for a fact that it was all worth it.

They're rough to the touch, somewhat misshapen in places, worn out in others, and even at arm's length, they reek of foot sweat. I bring them closer to my face, losing myself in the tactile sensationsl. My mind revels in the idea that Holly has walked hundreds of hours in these shoes, breaking them in, like she does with people. Rubbing her foot scent, her sweat, and her weight into them, also as she does with people.

I never thought about shoes with any particular interest, but these sandals are different. They are a vessel of Holly's victory over me, and the psychological effect they have on me is devastating. Before I know it, I'm rubbing my face against every inch of them like a cat, except I'm not marking them with my scent -- they're marking me with Holly's. I slowly massage as much sweat as I can glean off them into my skin. Absurdly, it feels like a badge of pride.

Before I know it, the rubbing becomes kissing, licking, sucking. My original question -- the one that set me along this path -- has now been answered. As my tongue reverently laps at the sweaty insole, I understand foot fetishists completely. I am one of them, after all, and making out with an old pair of sandals with more passion than I ever mustered for my conventional lovers.

I lie flat on the ground, pretending Holly is standing above me and pressing her sandals into my face. I give myself to the sandals, worshipping every inch of them, as my right hand inevitably finds its way down my body and towards my arousal.

The evening goes by in a frenzy, the world forgotten.

If I really ever thought getting the sandals was going to be the end of my problems, the next few days prove I was sadly mistaken. I'm distracted at work, daydreaming about Holly's feet. I'm distracted with Frank, to the point that I'm forced to tell him work is taking a toll on me -- which he believes, the sweetheart that he is. Perhaps my biggest problem is that the sandals alone are not enough.

I want more.

And a new opportunity is coming up: for the second weekend in a row, Frank will be away on a work event. He's super apologetic as he tells me, but internally, I'm overjoyed, and I make sure to tell Holly right away. Hopefully I won't have to compete with paying shoe-lickers this time around.

""My, my, aren't you eager,"" Holly texts me in response.

""Cmon,"" I type, so fast that it makes me feel dizzy. ""I know you had fun too.""

""Hey, you're the newb here, Jen. Me, I've been having fun with feet for years. You're nothing special :P""

Before I can come up with a reply, she's typing again. ""That said, I do have to admit: I never expected I'd be patting Frank's new girl on the head like she's a pet ""

I gulp, loins afire, humiliation coursing through my veins. But Holly isn't done with me.

""You even bought me shoes. What kinda loser does that? :P""

If only she knew to what lows I've fallen over the past week... I'd never live that down. Still, I try to shift the conversation away from the teasing, and back to what actually matters. I've only gotten the one opportunity to act out my submissiveness with her, back at the mall, and I know so much more about myself now. I'm dead-set, I want to meet her.

""So are you free this WE or what?""

I count my rapidly accelerating heartbeats in anticipation of the coming response. I fully expect it, and yet when my phone does buzz, it startles me so much I nearly drop it.

""Ehh, I don't know. If you hope to compete with all the guys who pay me for my time, you're going to have to step up to the plate, missy.""

This last message catches me particularly off-guard. Mere days ago I would have disregarded it as her gold-digging self manifesting, but the truth is, thrice now I have financially supported her in some ways: I've bought her pics, gifted her boots, and paid to worship her old sandals. If I do want more -- and that is clearly the case -- then there is only one logical way this road can continue.",,2025-08-15T19:06:39.939284,3707,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/her-daughters-boyfriend-1,Her Daughter's Boyfriend,Unknown Author,,,,,"There was the sound of knocking. Kelly rose from her couch. The 50 year old engineer smiled. She might not be as fit as she was back in college but the woman was still in good shape and very attractive. Kelly no longer had six pack abs but had only a tiny amount of belly fat. Her boobs were as large as ever and she had a thick ass.

She walked to the front door. The woman opened it with a large smile on her beautiful face.

It was Nick, her daughter's 18 years old childhood friend turned boyfriend. And hopefully, Kelly's own soon-to-be lover.

The black haired woman didn't know exactly when it started but she has been in love with her daughter's beau for some time now. He was not handsome in the conventional sense but he was kind, sweet and very charming. Not to mention very smart, too. She didn't know when she stopped seeing him as a kid and started seeing him as someone she wanted to be with, but the change in how she saw him has already happened - there was no going back.

""Hi, Ms. O'Brien,"" he said. She hugged him with a grin, pressing her tits against him. ""I brought some cupcakes from the local bakery. Your favourite. Is Kate home?""

Kelly decided to be brave and go after what she wanted.

""No, darling. My daughter's not home.""

""Oh, okay. Would you mind if I sit here and wait?"" he asked, setting the plastic bag down on a counter.

""Not at all.""

""Thanks."" He sat and read for a while. Kelly observed him as she did some sewing.

Half an hour later, she got up. ""Let me know if you want to help cook dinner. I am, if you recall, fairly competent in the kitchen,"" Nick said. He thought she was about to go cook a meal but boy was he wrong.

""You can help me with that later, Nick. There is something I want to discuss first."" She placed her hands on his arms and rubbed them. ""You are my daughter's boyfriend, yes?""

""Yes. Of course I'm her boyfriend.""

""And she's your girlfriend. Which is why I want you to follow me to my bedroom. I want you to fuck me.""

""What?!"" Nick sprang away, astonished.

""If you fuck me I will know if your dick is good enough for Kate or not,"" she lied through her teeth.

""No. No way. I'm sorry Ms. O'Brien, but I'm not cheating on her. And especially not with her own mother. That's crazy.""

Kelly frowned. She did not expect it to be difficult. The middle aged woman then said ""I am her mother. I own this house. She is now 18 years old. Either you fuck me or I'll kick her out and make her homeless.""

""You can't be serious,"" said Nick. He shook his head, fear in his eyes. She could easily hurt him - she was strong enough to do so. But it wasn't physical violence he was afraid of. No, it was the mad gleam in her eyes.

Somehow, he knew she meant what she said - that she would actually kick her daughter out of the house if he refused to give her what she wanted.

He asked ""Why do you want me to fuck you so badly?""

""I already told you. I need to know if you are good enough for my daughter. If you pass my test I will never bother you again.""

""And you will make your beloved daughter homeless if I refuse to go through this test and prove myself worthy of her? Sounds fishy to me.""

Damn, he's good.

Kelly was caught off guard. She decided to just tell him the truth.

""Okay, I lied,"" she admitted. ""You are cute and as you just proved seconds ago you are also smart, and I love you. I also really want to fuck you. If I can't have your cock then I'm kicking Kate out. That, I was being honest about. I care more about getting your dick than I care about my daughter.""

Nick didn't know what to do. He just stood still and listened to her as she continued.

""My daughter doesn't have any savings. You know how inflation fucked things up. She has nowhere near enough to rent an apartment or pay for college. Imagine your beloved Kate homeless, with not a penny in her pocket.""

It was true. As much as he loved Kate, she did spend frivolously and was always asking Kelly for money.

""And if I fuck you now? You will not make me do it a second time? It's bad enough that I will have to cheat on her and I really don't want to do it more than once.""

""Only one time, my dear. Only one time - unless you become addicted to my pussy and beg me for more,"" she said lasciviously.

Nick had always been faithful to his girlfriend. Before her, the boy spent all his time at home, reading Poirot novels in his bedroom. And then she, who was one of his only two friends, asked him out on a date. She was the sunshine in his life - the ray of hope that filled him with happiness and the desire to no longer be lonely.

They were friends before that, yes, but they didn't hang out anywhere other than at his or her house. That all changed when they started going outside together. Her brother, his only other friend, marvelled at how she brought him out of his shell.

And now Nick was being forced to cheat on her - and with her own mother, no less. The woman who was both his friend's mother and his girlfriend's mother.

He knew he could not put up a fight, not unless he wanted to jeopardize Kate's future. No, she was set to go to a good university, all expenses to be paid for by Kelly, so that she wouldn't have to take any loans and go into debt.

Nick can not ruin that for her.

""Alright. I will do what you want,"" he gave in, knowing that to fight was futile.

Kelly beamed. ""I knew you would agree,"" she squealed, pressing her full lips against his.

Her fiery kiss ignited a fire in his loins and he felt himself growing incredibly hard. Kelly smirked. She felt his manhood pressing up against her through his trousers and her yoga pants. The lecherous older woman fondled him through his clothes. ""My, my. I might be blackmailing you but you really are turned on by this.""

She unzipped him and made the teen remove his pants and boxers. Then Kelly wrapped her strong fingers around his young cock. Nick moaned. She stroked him, making him moan louder, very stiff in her hand.

She used her fist to pump him, giving his erect prick squeezes. ""Ahh, Ms O'Brien."" The black haired seductress played with his cock and gave him caresses.

""Call me Mommy,"" she hissed, tugging faster and using her other hand to rub his hanging balls.

""Mommy, your hands feel so good,"" said the boy. Nick's penis quivered. He had masturbated before, of course. But having this super hot woman, who is also his girlfriend's mom, jacking him off? It felt so much better than his hand ever made him feel. Her gorgeous face was smiling as she continued stroking his erection, using his slippery pre-cum as lube.

""Thanks, baby. But you know what? My mouth feels even better."" And with that, she got down on her knees, tied her hair in a high ponytail and took him in her mouth. He nearly screamed in shock at how wonderful her wet, warm mouth felt around his manhood.

She bobbed her head, fellating Nick expertly. His legs trembled. He struggled to remain steady - a futile struggle, given that the inexperienced boy never felt anywhere near this much pleasure in his life.

Tasting his young cock made Kelly's pussy throb. Her cunt was soaked. She was horny and desperately wanted the rod in her pussy next.

After just a couple of minutes, she stopped. ""I'll let you cum, if you make me cum first,"" she told Nick. Then Kelly undressed, getting out of her clothes and underwear. She laid down on her bed completely naked, spreading her thick thighs apart. He gazed at her shaved pussy and felt himself getting harder.

The boy buried his face in her cunt. He licked her labia and thrust his tongue in and out of her. His thumb found her clit, rubbing it, making her moan for a change.

""Yes, baby. Just like that,"" she moaned. Nick then replaced his thumb with his tongue and also used his lips, sucking her hard clitoris. The button was now engorged and super sensitive.

He devoted his attention to her. It paid off. Soon she was a complete mess, her body shaking all over. ""Oh God. Yes, lick Mommy's pussy, baby. Eat Mommy out. Yes, that's it, my good boy.""

""Mommy's pussy tastes so good!"" he paused long enough to tell her, and then went right back to feasting on the much older woman's cunt. Hearing it made her smile, delighted.

She wrapped her meaty legs around his head and then screamed, climaxing violently.

The gorgeous woman sprayed her warm juices all over his young face, drenching the young teenager with her pussy fluids the way she wanted.

""Amazing,"" she heaved. ""Now lie down on the bed, baby boy. Mommy's gonna ride you."" She grabbed his hard dick and positioned herself with her hot vagina above him, her sticky juices flowing down onto his shaft.

""Wait, don't we need a condom? In case you, uh, get pregnant?"" he asked as he was about to get fucked. She giggled, still holding on to his prick, rubbing his manhood gently.

""I'm 50, baby. I already hit menopause."" She mounted him, taking his already hard cock inside her smoothly. Her cunt sheathed Nick's manhood with no difficulty, given that she has had much bigger dicks before.

""How does my 50 year old pussy feel?"" she asked. It was only at that moment that he fully realized what was going on. He moaned in pleasure and awe as it all came crashing on him at once. He had just lost his virginity to his girlfriend's 50 year old mother. And it felt like heaven inside the single mother's love canal. Her tunnel was so fucking tight.

""Ahhhh,"" he moaned, eyes rolling into the back of his head. That was good enough for her. She started riding his barely legal dick.

All the inexperienced nerd could do was hang on for dear life. He clutched the bedsheets, holding on and moaning louder and louder. She ravished him - her pussy tainting his young cock, marking him with her juices. Claiming the young meat as her territory.

""Fuck me harder, Mommy. Fuck me really hard!"" the boy groaned beneath her, writhing about on the bed as she impaled herself on his fuck-stick.

She speared herself with his rod, her hands pinning him down by the shoulders and her lips pressing against his. She kissed him hard, forcing her hot tongue inside his mouth as her ass bounces on his balls. The woman fucked him mercilessly, clamping her cunt around his cock like a vice.

""You like Mommy's pussy, baby? You like how Mommy is fucking you?"" she asked, slamming down aggressively, nearly breaking the bed. His cock throbbed inside her.

""Ahhh, yes! Yes, Mommy's pussy feels so good! I love how Mommy fucks me! I'm going to cum!"" he warned her, feeling her vaginal juices bathing his hard cock and soaking his balls.

""Cum in me, baby. Cum in Mommy's hot little pussy."" Her words made him erupt. He screamed as he exploded inside her.

The boy fired what felt to him like gallons of pent up cum up inside Kelly's waiting cunt. He filled up his girlfriend's sexy mom with jizz, creaming her and coating the insides of her womb white.

A couple of minutes later, she got up from the bed and walked over to a clock.

""You wouldn't make me cheat on Kate anymore, right?""

""This is a spy camera,"" she said.

He was only momentarily surprised.

""Of course you set up a hidden camera,"" the freshly fucked teenager sighed. ""You knew that one day Kate would be financially independent and your threat of kicking her out wouldn't work on me again. So you got long term blackmail material.""

Kelly smiled affectionately. ""As smart as ever, my lovely. Yes. If you ever step out of line I will post this on the internet. Imagine if people at your university and your future employers see this clip - a clip of you getting fucked by a woman old enough to be your mother. Older than you mother, in fact - she is 45, yes?""

""44.""

""Yes, yes. 44. So?""

""Alright, Mommy. I'll always be your little fuck toy.""

""Good boy, baby! Now come with me. I want to take a shower with you. Kate will be home in about half an hour.""

........

Kate was getting worried. The overweight girl's boyfriend was acting weird and nervous. She and him were having lunch together, and he was all jumpy whenever she said something.

""Are you sure you're okay, baby?"" she asked.

He stammered ""Y-Y-Yeah! Sure. I'm good. Just a little bit of stomach-ache."" She frowned. It was a believable excuse but still the girl couldn't stop worrying.

She had no idea that he was wracked with guilt right now, plagued by the memory of how he had betrayed her.

Nick told himself he had no choice.

After all, if he didn't give in to Kelly's demand and fuck her yesterday, she would have kicked Kate out and Kate would have nowhere to go. So really, he did it just to protect his girlfriend - to keep a roof over her head.

Yet he still felt guilt, for he enjoyed the act so much that he got hard just from thinking of how the much older woman had taken his virginity, draining him of cum. She had emptied his balls and he left her house a changed boy.

He was so ashamed of himself and drowning in so much remorse that he almost didn't hear his phone buzzing.

The boy glanced down. He paled.

""I didn't know you still call your mom Mommy,"" Kate teased.

It wasn't Nick's mom calling him. It was Kate's. She had insisted on him changing the contact detail, slapping him on the ass on his way out of her house yesterday.

""Oh, yeah. It's her,"" he said, laughing nervously. He quickly answered the call.

""Tell my daughter that you have to help your mother with some chores, and then go straight to the parking lot. I'm waiting for you right now.""

Nick hung up the call.

""Honey, I really enjoyed the lunch but my mom needs help with some chores. I'm really sorry, but I have to go now.""

""Oh."" Kate looked dejected. Nick felt his heart breaking. He leaned forward, gently kissing her on her forehead. Then he put some cash on the table and left the restaurant.

He walked through the mall, passing many people on his way to the parking lot.

The boy soon spotted Kelly's Jaguar. She rolled down the window and told him to get in. He opened the door and got in quickly.

As she drove, he asked ""Where are we going, Mommy?""

""Home - where I plan to fuck your brains out,"" she replied, giving him a horny smile.

Nick felt himself redden. His cheeks were aflame as he asked ""Couldn't you wait until after my date with Kate was over?""

""No. Your cock is mine and I want it inside me. I want to milk you dry - ride you until your cum is deep in my pussy.""

She drove fast and soon they were at her house. The single mother parked her car. She got out of the car and so did Nick. He followed her inside her house. She took him to her huge bedroom like she did yesterday, lying down on her back. This time, he did not need as many instructions.

He removed her tight skirt, revealing that she wasn't wearing panties. First he worshipped her muscular thighs with kisses. He felt himself getting really stiff from kissing her toned legs. Then he kissed her bare pussy and she groaned, growing wetter. Lapping up her tasty juices made him harder down there. He eagerly tasted her fluids, loving the stickiness of it. Her juices were an aphrodisiac for the teenager.

""Your young cock is really hard for Mommy, isn't it?"" she asked teasingly. He told her yes before continuing to eat her out. She moaned, loving how he used his tongue. He tongue-fucked her and massed her clitoris, before switching tactics and licking and sucking her clit instead.

It drove her into a frenzy and she began leaking more. His face was now covered in her cunt juices yet he kept on going. He played with her clit, using his lips and thrusting a couple of fingers in and out of her slit. Finger-fucking her while sucking her clitoris pushed her to the point of no return.

""Squirt all over my slutty face, Mommy,"" he found himself saying, then sucked her clit hard. It made her erupt and she began spraying all over him like he told her to. It would have been a wonderful way to die, drowning in her sticky fluids as she covered him in her cum.

""You enjoy being my sex slave now, don't you? I never told you that you have to talk dirty, yet you did it. Come to think of it, you also did that yesterday,"" she said, getting on all fours, raising her massive ass. She slapped her own thick ass, making it jiggle. ""Grab my ass and fuck me. Bury your cock in my pussy, baby boy.""

Nick obeyed her. He grabbed her by her thick asscheeks and slid into her from behind, lodging himself inside her warm vagina. Her pussy was as tight as he remembered it. He moaned, starting to thrust in and out of her hot hole.

One of his hands moved around her, finding her clit and gently rubbing it while he fucked her cunt. She sighed in pleasure, enjoying his touch, telling him to keep caressing it.

""Yes, baby boy. Rub Mommy's clit and fuck Mommy."" Her much younger lover started fucking faster - the friction making him hornier every second.

His other hand plays with her ass. He banged his girlfriend's mom, moaning ""Ahhh, Mommy's pussy is perfect. I love fucking Mommy so much."" Nick told himself he was only talking dirty to stay on her good side, out of fear that she will ruin his and Kate's lives, but he didn't really believe it.

All he could do was keep on fucking her. His cock throbbed inside Kelly.

Kelly slammed her huge ass back at him, using him as a piece of meat. She treated him like he's a human dildo, telling him ""You're my piece of young meat, baby boy. Just Mommy's sex slave. Cum in Mommy's pussy.""

He couldn't hold it in any longer. The boy erupted, firing geysers of cum inside his girlfriend's sexy mother.

Nick filled her up like a donut, emptying his balls in her. Soon she was full of his warm semen. His seed leaked out of her hole and she said 'That's my good boy.""

Nick cuddled with his girlfriend's mother after fucking her. He was exhausted, spent after she banged the hell out of him and made him empty his tender balls inside her. She, meanwhile, looked refreshed. The single mother stroked her daughter's boyfriend's hair, holding him close. Kelly kissed him on his forehead maternally.

""So you plan on having me as your lover for the rest of your life?"" he suddenly asked.

His girlfriend's hot mom nodded. ""Yes, baby. And I have a feeling you are no longer so opposed to the idea.""

""Why is that?""

""Because your cock is hard again."" It was true. He was poking one of her thick thighs. Her observation flustered him and he buried his face in her boobs, which only made his boner grow.

Suddenly, there was the sound of someone opening the front door. Kelly sprang up from her bed and hurriedly put her top and skirt on. ""Wait here,"" she instructed him, pulling the cover up over his body. She opened the door, dashing outside and closing it behind her.

He lowered the cover and listened intently but couldn't hear anything, so the teenager just waited.

............

Kelly saw her daughter's face. For a moment, she felt guilt. She knew that she was responsible for Nick's recent weird behaviour which has been troubling Kate of late. But she couldn't just admit to fucking her daughter's boyfriend.

""What is it, honey?""

""It's Nick. I think he's hiding something from me. Like another girl.""

The single mom placed a hand on her daughter's shoulder. ""I'm sure that's not true, sweetie,"" she said, all while her daughter's boyfriend's cum was seeping out of her warm hole.

""Then why has he been so nervous lately? He claimed that he is sick but I could just tell - I just know that he is hiding something. I just know. It's a feeling."" Kate started tearing up. Kelly felt terrible but alas, she cared more about getting laid than her own daughter. What mattered most to her was getting Nick's cock inside her and having him pound her pussy.

""Honey, I love you. You are a wonderful girl and Nick is a smart boy. He knows that - knows what a catch you are. He would never cheat on you.""",,2025-08-15T19:07:14.620578,3663,

THE CHALLENGE OF PLACING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER

Cassie made everyone breakfast, got the boys ready for school and made their lunches. Sam grizzled about the type of snack bar she had bought; Charlie forgot where he'd left one of his school shoes. She watched the clock ticking away the minutes as the usual circus unfolded in front of her, checking her work schedule to see which clients were booked in with her today like she would normally do, while directing traffic in the kitchen because that was what a mother would do. Damian stopped in the hallway, pulling her close and kissing her as the boys circled them. Cassie kissed him back, because that was what a wife would do, especially after a night of passion with her husband.

Damian scooped up the car keys, giving both sons a hug, and headed out. Cassie managed to find the other shoe, stopping to ask Charlie how he had managed to lose just one shoe, then packed the school bags and herded the twins through the front door. The walk to school took five minutes; drop off was uneventful and she was soon on her way to the store to buy some groceries for dinner.

The store was half empty, aside from a couple of mothers from school doing the same thing. She nodded to them, exchanged a few words, while wandering the aisles collecting vegetables, beef, pasta, rice. She weighed up the pros and cons of coconut milk versus low fat coconut milk and then patrolled the cosmetics aisle looking for deodorant.

Cassie took one look at the rows of boxes of toothpaste and began to tremble. She turned towards the checkout, grimacing at the lady swiping her groceries unhurriedly through the till. Cassie stuffed her shopping into a bag, paid, and then fled the store. She barely made it to the female washrooms before she broke down.

In her mind, through the tears, were two visions: Damian, with his face close to hers last night, his body inside her, hard and strong; versus Damian, with his hands spread across the younger woman's breasts while Cassie watched from the walk-in wardrobe. She couldn't process it. Two alternate realities, one of which was familiar, comfortable, full of love, and the other a nightmare, her place in her husband's life usurped by the willowy blonde stranger.

She gripped the sides of the wash basin, paralysed, for a long time. Then, eventually, she pulled herself together to get on with her day.

---

Cassie's phone pinged: the receptionist was letting her know her appointment had arrived. She took one last look around the meeting space to satisfy herself that everything was in order, then headed out to the lobby area. It was a good arrangement; the meeting space granted her up to ten hours a week, giving her a professional environment to meet clients without the hassle of setting up her own office or having to make house calls. She could appear professional and give her clients a clean, welcoming place to discuss their issues. It also felt good to be in a different environment, away from kids and home life. Especially now, but she repressed that line of thought mercilessly, tucking it away into a separate compartment in her mind. She couldn't afford to break down again, not with clients waiting.

Cassie smoothed her blouse as she walked and fussed with her hair, dressed in a pair of dark trousers and low heels. She straightened her back, and took a deep, calming breath, pushing away the other parts of her life to concentrate on her clients for the next hour.

She saw the man and the woman in the reception area and waved them over. The woman moved first, her partner tagging along behind, reluctantly. Cassie welcomed them into the meeting space and closed the door.

""Good to see you again,"" she said, ""Won't you take a seat? Sit anywhere you feel comfortable.""

The man hesitated, but when his wife selected the sofa, he dutifully took his place next to her. Cassie selected a chair opposite. She smiled brightly at the couple sitting in front of her, as if the act would lift her own spirits and push away the other thoughts to the back of her mind. Burying her own feelings wasn't healthy, as a psychologist she knew that better than most people, but for the next hour she needed to put her clients first.

""Kiko,"" she began, directing her attention to the slim, black-haired woman before her, ""Do you want to go first? How have you been since we spoke last?""

The woman nodded, smiling shyly, before replying in a soft, gentle voice, ""Good. I have no complaints.""

Brett shifted in his seat, grumbling, ""That's not true, otherwise we wouldn't be here.""

The corners of Kiko's mouth turned down briefly, but then she continued. ""Our life is good. We are looking forward to taking a holiday soon.""

""That sounds nice,"" Cassie replied, easing into what was going to be a challenging conversation, ""Where to?""

""We're going back to Osaka to visit my parents."" She reached out and took her husband's hand in hers.

""And how about you Brett? How're you going?"" Cassie asked, directing her attention to Kiko's partner.

He was a tall man, wiry rather than broad, maybe a few years older than his wife, late-thirties. He wore rounded glasses and had salt-and-pepper close-cropped hair. He was looking distinctly uncomfortable with the question.

""I don't really know how to answer that,"" he muttered.

""How have the exercises been going? Let's start with that.""

Brett let go of his wife's hand and folded his arms across his chest.

""Okay, I think. We've been talking a lot.""

""Do you still feel the same way about your wife?""

Brett tilted his head to one side, eyes fixed on Cassie. She waited, letting Brett feel comfortable filling the gap in conversation.

""No,"" he admitted at last, ""No, I don't. We talked a lot, and I'm starting to understand her side of things.""

""Do you think it's acceptable behaviour?""

Brett stood up and began to pace the room, much to Cassie's surprise.

""Do you want to take a break?"" she asked.

""No. I, um,"" Brett replied, making a gesture with his hands. ""Uh, can I speak to you privately? Is that allowed?""

Kiko's eyes widened in dismay.

""Kiko, it's up to you. This session is for the both of you.""

She was watching her husband pace. Finally, she stood.

""I think if he needs to speak alone, I will give him that. I will wait outside until you call.""

Kiko walked to the door, her hand resting momentarily on her husband's arm as she passed. The door closed and Brett let out a deep breath. He sat back down, leaning forward, head in hands. Cassie waited.

""The thing is,"" he stammered, ""I... Well, I was brought up a certain way. I can't help it, and frankly, I don't want to. Women. It's a pretty fixed thing. How a wife should behave, how you should treat her.""

""I see. I understand there is an element of re-learning what you grew up with. The question is whether you're willing to change for your wife.""

Brett snorted. ""She's pretty clear, she's not going to change to accommodate me.""

Cassie noted the vehemence in his tone. Kiko seemed to be very mild and placid; they must have had bitter arguments in private to get as far as needing to come to Cassie in the first place.

""Do you think you can change?""

Brett stood up again and resumed pacing.

""Cassidy, do you know what you're asking of me? My family would disown me,"" he blurted angrily, ""You're asking me to beat my wife.""

""Brett, please sit,"" said Cassie, ""Let's talk through what you're feeling.""

Brett's pacing stalled and he flopped back down into his seat, raising his hands in the air.

""I'm feeling like I'm being railroaded.""

""When Kiko suggested coming to see me, what outcome were you looking for?""

""Honestly? I was hoping you could talk her out of this. It's not right. I mean, I knew that marrying her, there would be cultural differences, but... I didn't expect this.""

Cassie waited for Brett to calm himself before she continued.

""This isn't a cultural difference though. It's a personal one. What she's asking from you is something that's deep-seated. It's part of her.""

""Do you think I should hit women?"" Brett asked, eyes hard as marbles, ""Do you think it's normal?""

""Normal is a relative term. The need for something other than the typical, uh, vanilla requirements is not unusual between couples, and if it's done consensually it can actually bring about a much stronger bond between you.""

""What if I hurt her though? What if she sees a side of me she doesn't like? What if I make her afraid of me?""

""I can give you some reading on this. There are protocols you can both follow. She can choose a safeword, so you know instantly if it's going too far.""

Brett slumped in his seat, running a hand through his close-cropped hair.

""I guess,"" he said at last.

""Okay. Shall we call Kiko back in?""

""In a minute. I've got one thing more to ask.""

Brett looked up and Cassie saw the doubt in his face as he struggled to piece his thoughts together.

""Everything that happens in this office is confidential, right?""

Cassie nodded. ""Doctor-patient privilege,"" she confirmed.

""I'd like to do it here.""

""Why?""

""I have no idea what I'm doing. I guess, I dunno, uh,"" his hands balled into fists. ""Everything I've ever done, if it was hard, I've always had backup. My brother, my Dad. Now I'm at the point that I really need backup in my relationship and there's absolutely no-one I can ask. I can't tell anyone about this, because, like I said, they'd disown me. So I'm asking you.""

Cassie understood what Brett was asking. It rubbed against her professional ethics, but as she pondered his request, she had to admit that it didn't violate her own moral code. She was here to help, and Brett needed help, simple as that.

""If that's what you need, we can set up a session,"" she replied.

Brett seemed to relax.

""Thank you,"" he breathed, ""Thank you so much.""

---

Cassie didn't bring it up that night, even after the twins were asleep and she was left to watch a show as Damian worked away in the study. She was trying to concentrate on her entertainment choices: a rom-com, or a documentary? There was a comedy series all the mothers were raving about, so maybe she should watch that. At least she would be able to join in the conversation tomorrow at the school gates. In the background, she could hear the clatter of her husband's fingers on the keyboard. He had a big pitch to finish for a meeting in the morning and didn't want to be distracted.

At ten o'clock, she gave up the effort, turning off the show she was watching. She stood at the study doorway, looking in at her husband, still typing away. Cassie's stomach churned, knowing she had to say something, fearing what it would mean if she did. Damian appeared not to notice her, headphones on, listening to music as he finessed the wording.

If she said the words, it would be the end of her world. The comfortable, happy home, children in bed, mortgage paid up, their nice circle of mutual friends, all of it would have to be dismantled. But, she couldn't just leave it and ignore what he'd done. Without warning, Damian turned and she was suddenly face to face with her husband.

""Hey,"" she began, but then her voice left her.

Damian nodded, pushing the headphones back from his ears. ""What's up?"" he asked, but she realised it was a general question. He couldn't see the war inside her.

""Do you have time to talk?""

Cassie's heart was beating madly in her chest, her adrenaline surging like it had in the wardrobe. Damian frowned apologetically.

""I really gotta...,"" he said, gesturing at the screen.

Cassie stalled.

""Is there something you need to talk about now or can we do it later?"" he asked.

Her resolve crumbled. ""No, it's okay. I was just heading up to bed,"" she said, ""Don't stay up too late.""

""I won't. Good night.""

Damian slid the headphones back on and turned back to the screen. Cassie left him to it, heading up the stairs to their bedroom. Her stomach was still churning, but she was feeling something else now: relief, like the feeling of being involved in a traffic accident, but getting out of the car unhurt. As she laid in bed, Cassie tried for a long time to work it all out in her head, using her training, treating herself as the client.

There were other scenarios. Maybe it was a one-off; maybe it was a fling without love involved; maybe it would fizzle out on its own and Damian would realise that his life with Cassie was worth more than a casual encounter with a sexy young blonde. She shuddered: it was such a cliché. How would their friends react if she went for the nuclear option? Then she thought about the boys, seeing their faces in her imagination, their tears as the family split apart, and it wrenched her guts. They would suffer, and it was that thought that tapped into a deep well of anguish inside her.

Just before sleep claimed her, Cassie had resolved a plan of action. She and Damian would need to talk, but it would be in a controlled environment, pre-planned, not standing in the study doorway while he was distracted. She wasn't going to blindside him because they both needed to be rational. She was going to work through the reasons for his actions with him, like adults. If, after all that, they came to the conclusion that he didn't love her anymore, they could move forward.

Drowsily, she concluded that it might have just been something he would only ever do that once, something to bring up at the right time. Would it be something she would end the marriage over, if it was a single indiscretion? Their bond was stronger than that. She would get them through it. Her thoughts evaporated into sleep, as she resolved a course of action. She wouldn't be going to her mother's house next Tuesday; instead, she would be waiting at home to see if history repeated itself. It was the best way to be sure.

---

Cassie dropped the twins off at school as usual and went straight to her mother's. She talked about small things and mooched around her mother's kitchen, listening to tales of the neighbour's indiscretions. Cassie nodded, ticking away the time, doing her bit for mother-daughter relations, waiting until the clock said eleven o'clock.

""Sorry,"" she said, interrupting her mother in full flow about a friend's daughter's love life, ""I need to be home for a delivery.""

Her mother frowned. ""You need to go?""

""Uh, yeah.""

""But you only just got here. We didn't get around yet to how you are.""

Cassie shrugged. ""I'm going fine. There's nothing to tell.""

She watched the her mother fix her with a knowing look.

""Really,"" Cassie reiterated, ""We're good.""

Her mother shrugged and the topic swung back around to her neighbour's daughter. Cassie played along for politeness for a while before insisting that she really had to leave. Her mother acquiesced, seeming sad to lose a sympathetic ear to her stories.

Back home, Cassie rushed through the front door, checking her watch to gauge how long she had left to get into her hiding place. It was madness, contemplating what she was about to do; no sane woman would rush home to be in the wardrobe for when her husband brought his girlfriend home for a lunchtime lovemaking session. Cassie stopped, mid thought. Girlfriend? What if she really was? What if Cassie heard them talking today, what if Damian said that he loved her, just like he'd told Cassie? What would that mean?

A car door slammed. Startled, Cassie ran up the stairs into the master bedroom and into the walk-in wardrobe, cowering behind the door and straining to hear any movements from below. Too late, her rational side kicked in: what if Damian needed to change his shirt or his pants afterwards? He would have to open the door to the wardrobe and Cassie would have nowhere to hide, exposed to the stare of his blonde lover as Cassie was discovered, standing forlornly in the wardrobe. It was only blind luck that Damian hadn't opened the wardrobe door the first time. She should....

The front door opened. Damian called out her name and waited.

Cassie's world imploded, her fears confirmed as she heard a female voice downstairs. They were going to fuck on her bed, and she had backed herself into a trap, unable to run. Cassie didn't need to see it again, but now she would have no choice. Her blood pounded in her ears as she resolved her course of action. She would fling the door open when they entered the bedroom. She would launch into a screaming match with her cheating husband. Cassie would show him how furious she was, how betrayed she felt. Her hands curled into fists in the dark as the adrenaline spiked. Damian was going to find out that his meek little wife meant business.

A figure passed in front of her, clearly visible through the slatted wardrobe door. Lily was wearing a sleeveless grey blouse in a sheer, satiny material, over a pair of tight black trousers. She was walking backwards into the room, her long, straight blonde hair tied back into a ponytail, grinning playfully at someone out of sight to her left.

Damian walked into view and Cassie's heart leaped. She uncurled a fist and wrapped it around the slats, bracing herself to spring out of her hiding place.

But Damain lurched forward, wrapping his arms around the younger blonde woman, lifting her off her feet and shaking her so that her high heels fell to the carpet, making her giggle and squirm. Damian buried his face against her neck, kissing her passionately on her throat. He groaned.

It froze Cassie in shock, her hand suddenly unable to move, her eyes locked on the two of them, caught in a passionate embrace right in front of her. Cassie watched mutely as Lily's neck craned until her delicate, red lips could nibble Damian's ear, sending him into paroxysms of his own. They tumbled down onto the bed together, a mass of squirming arms and legs, giggling and laughing. Damian buried his face between Lily's beasts.

Cassie stumbled backwards, landing against one of the shelves. She froze, staring out at the bodies but they didn't seem to notice the sound, too deeply engrossed in their own passion. Her body went stiff and she tried to bring her breathing back under control, feeling the same waves of emotion crashing over her again. Fury at her husband's betrayal turned to anger at the younger woman flaunting herself on the bed, but these feelings gave way to a searing jealously that Lily could make him behave like that, with such passion and desire. How could this stranger so enflame the man she had loved all these years, that he would forget about his wife, his family, his oath to her? What made her so irresistible that her husband became a wild beast, wanting to bury himself inside her?

She was left with the devastating question: why didn't Damian do that with Cassie?

Her husband had pinned his lover to the bed, and was sitting up, straddling her lithe body. He unbuttoned his shirt and slid it off his broad shoulders, baring his chest as he leaned over the younger woman. Lily's hands rose from the bed, fingers tracing his pectorals. He raised his hips and she began to unbutton his pants, pushing them down his legs, exposing his firm, sculpted buttocks. Fully naked now, her husband's body pressed against his lover, kissing and stroking her.

""You're going to mess me up,"" she laughed.

""Absolutely.""

Damian buried his face against Lily's outstretched neck, kissing her softly as he raised himself up over her body on all fours. From Cassie's vantage point, she could see her husband's engorged manhood standing rigidly out from his groin. One of Lily's hands encircled his cock, raking the length of his shaft with her fingernails.",,2025-08-15T19:07:21.724337,3501,

***

50th of Fonic, 14 AVE.

Shai Domain, City of Shai.

""This is unwise, my Potentate,"" Salik said in a near whisper.

They stood in a corridor outside The Citadel's dining room as they prepared to face their guests. Varse pushed aside a painting to peer through a hidden peephole. ""So it is.""

Inside waited twenty-eight men, each a member of Sinshi's cabal. Several paced impatiently while others sat quietly at the dining table. Arkos, Lanthians, Taziks. Jidun sat among them as the sole Dril in the heart of his species' homeland, tapping his finger with a grimace of concern. His wounds had healed enough to conceal his secret, leaving his face marked with deep scars.

""Wait here, boy. You'll know when to join me,"" Varse commanded as he replaced the painting. He ignored the protest in Salik's piercing red eyes as he turned towards the door. It was time to step into a pit of serpents, emerging victorious or not at all.

Every man stood as he entered, bowing their heads with respect as they gave a customary ""My Potentate,"" in unison. They watched him closely, no doubt ready to drop their act of servitude at a moment's notice.

""Please, gentlemen. Take a seat."" Varse gestured before finding his own at the head of the long table, placing himself across from Jidun. The Dril refused to meet his eyes.

They joined him at the table, each finding a chalice waiting. Twenty-eight pairs of eyes watched him. Twenty-eight remaining men who had participated in his attempted assassinations. He allowed the tension in the room to sharpen, as if forging a blade that may cut their throats.

Varse watched them regard their surroundings with subtly masked suspicion. ""I shall cut directly to the heart of why you've been summoned. A rumor has reached my ear. A rumor that pains me greatly, for it appears that a man among us may have participated in the attempts on my life.""

He watched their trained expressions shift, each anticipating danger. Several glanced at Jidun, though their ringleader remained motionless.

""I offer no accusations, gentlemen."" Varse withheld his disgust as he studied each of them in turn. ""This matter shall be investigated, though I hope to discover no truth to such a vile rumor. Still...""

As their Potentate gestured to the chalice before him, many peeked at their own. A black liquid waited at the bottom, hardly filling a third of each cup.

""When you accepted the duty of serving the aims of The Domain, you each drank a portion of Dril blood, binding you to our people. As agents of Shai, you've sworn to-""

""We know our vows, my Potentate,"" one of the men interrupted, an Arkos.

Jidun shot the Arkos a deadly glance. ""You'll keep your damn mouth shut.""

Varse hid his annoyance. Let them believe they held a sliver of control in this chamber. Let them believe they could openly disrespect him. It would matter little. ""As I was saying, our guiding philosophy is quite simple. We wish to be left alone, free of the danger and influence of outsiders. To succeed in this, we must weaken and manipulate outside realms until they pose no true threat to The Domain. Infighting shall only serve to poison us. Treachery shall see us destroyed before our enemies lay a single step within our lands.""

They all appeared to listen, yet Varse knew they only awaited a signal from their true leader. It'd be quite clumsy to openly assassinate a Potentate within the heart of The Domain itself. Disastrous, even. Only their hesitation spared his life, maintained by Jidun's silence.

""Unity among us must be assured, and in light of these rumors, I shall require you all once more to reseal your vow."" Varse picked up his chalice carefully. ""We'll drink as brothers and taste the blood of those you've sworn to serve. Let us put aside these disgusting whispers.""

He watched them look to Jidun in both amusement and caution. Let them judge him a fool. Let them believe he was either naive enough to trust their loyalty, or desperate to escape his doom. They thought him to be prey in a room full of predators, when only one true predator sat before them.

Jidun played his part, beckoning the blue pintila worm in the center of the table towards him. The poison-sensing creature slithered into his hand, opening its circular mouth. He frowned at Varse. ""No offense, my Potentate.""

""By all means, I'll do the same,"" he said, watching Jidun drip several drops of the black blood from his chalice into the worm's mouth. They waited a moment, seeing the creature's blue skin remain unblemished. No poison.

The rest of the room watched as Varse took his turn, testing his drink. As planned, no poison tainted the liquid. Jidun raised his chalice to his lips, only to scowl at his men. ""Well? You heard him. Drink!""

They held the advantage, and as they watched their leader drink without fear, they slowly began to join in at his command.

Varse consumed the black blood before allowing his stern expression to harden further. He waited, merely watching them finish. Only when the first cough echoed quietly through the chamber did he break his silence. ""The truth is, I love this land. We hold a unique freedom that has never existed outside our borders. It's a tranquility worth defending, and I'd gladly give my life to do just that.""

Another coughed, louder now. Then another, drawing the attention of the others as they found their own throats beginning to warm. The last two men to drink spit out the blood, their hesitation having spared them. They hurried to their feet. A Lanthian and a Tazik, the orange skinned of the two stabbed a finger in Varse's direction as he readied his blade. ""Scheming worm!""

Gripping their throats, all other men began to writhe, many falling to the floor. Varse watched the scene in disgust. ""Let them choke on broken vows.""

""You were a fool to trust him, Jidun! A damned fool!"" the remaining Lanthian accused, preparing to leap across the table to slay their Potentate. The door behind him whipped open as Salik burst into the room, driving his blade through the green man's back.

The Tazik raised his blade in defense. An upward swing of Salik's curved sword cleaved his hands from his wrists. Frozen in shock, the horned assassin remained wordless as Salik grabbed the back of his head, slamming it down hard into the stone table with an audible crunch.

""Hold! I did my par-"" Jidun held out his hands to protect himself as Salik silently approached, gritting his teeth in pain as he was ripped from his chair. The masked man dragged him across the length of the table, knocking over chalices until he was delivered upon his back to The Potentate. ""Y...you vowed to spare me, damn you!""

Salik folded his arms, towering above him. ""Your death shall not come by my hand.""

Remaining seated, Varse took a moment to hear the struggling men slowly fall silent one by one. Every death fell upon his shoulders, a necessity he endured with a grimace. ""Duty requires me to end your life, hybrid. Your existence threatens my people, yet your death may remove a valuable asset that may prevent a greater danger. I shall ask this only once. If I spare your life, do you vow to speak of your involvement with Sinshi to The Council upon my command?""

Hesitating, Jidun finally nodded. ""Fine, fine. I'll tell them everything. Just-""

""Only upon my command. The threat of such a thing shall either tame Sinshi or damn us both.""

Perplexed, Jidun attempted to rise before Salik forced him again onto his back.

The smell of rot began to trickle from the mouths of the bodies scattered throughout the room, the skin of their throats turning black. Varse scowled, doing his best to avoid seeing their faces. ""These men shall be replaced with beings of my own choosing, and you shall be relieved of your command. Dril will protect Dril once more."" He nodded to Salik. ""Bring him to the cells beneath The Citadel.""

The masked assassin obeyed, dragging Jidun away. Within moments Varse was alone, faced with a chamber of bodies. How easy it would have been to simply let them slay him; one body traded for twenty-seven others. He would have found peace, perhaps, yet his life was all that remained to defend his people from catastrophe. He'd cling to it a little longer.

41st of Fixuin, 14 AVE.

Kingdom of Harin, Near Littlexia.

Cendra's sword carved through the air as she twirled, its sharp edge digging deep into the trunk of a palm tree. She yanked it free, spinning away as she practiced her form.

Two miles from the legion encampment besieging Littlexia, she bit her lip in frustration as her movements were a fraction of a second delayed. It was her pregnancy, she knew, her belly already noticeable to any who looked upon her. She had kept to herself, of course, almost able to convince herself that she wasn't hiding away in embarrassment. When their ships had left Talin behind, she had locked herself within her cabin. While Irith's knowledge of Wirmri allowed the legion to take the city efficiently, she had camped within the wilderness. Humiliating as it was to miss the glory of battle, the alternative was much worse.

A flame erupted up the blade of her sword as she felt a spike of anger, cleaving through the thin trunk of a second tree. It burned as it collapsed to the reddish sand of the beach, its dark blue leaves splashing into the water.

""Faster, worthless fool..."" she told herself, marking her next wooden opponent as her blade danced. Another tree fell, and for the hundredth time that morning, her thoughts wandered to the new life she sensed within her womb.

A grimace of regret tugged at her lips. The creature within her was at once a reminder of her father's love and a betrayal to Clin. It'd shame him, shame

her

, yet hadn't she decided to love both men equally? Did her vow to bear only Clin's child no longer stand when he himself offered to raise her bastard? Even the very concept of a bastard was slowly being stripped away by The Empire, yet still she clung to her pride.

Sword blazing, she leapt into a backflip before striking a tree as she landed, her movements ever so slightly losing elegance. Her mind fell to the root of her reasoning, remembering Vixin with a flare of rage. Vixin had slept with their father, the first to claim his love. Cendra would not fall to such a level, or so she had thought long ago. Vixin had given birth to a non-royal. Cendra would not, until now. Vixin had birthed their father's baby. Cendra had held against the final bastion of her pride...only to fall. For the first time, she allowed herself to acknowledge that she had followed in her sister's footsteps almost entirely.

Her breath quickened, not slowing even as she came to a stop. Her rage slipped from her grasp, revealing what lay beneath as she looked to her trembling hand with utter shook. Was she...afraid? Her breaths continued, mind racing. She was the firstborn, The God Emperor's pride. She held a duty to be better, to show what an imperial princess should be. Yet in all her pride, she was no better than the daughter of the woman that had killed her mother. She was

failing

, losing control.

The pride that had held her above her vile sister was collapsing despite her desperation. Would Xenia laugh at her from her grave? Seeing her fall to Vixin's level?

Cendra lowered her weapon, gazing into the gargantuan river. She heard the chirping of creatures in the distance, her mind gradually slowing.

Her father had granted her this baby out of love, she knew.

That

she would not lose to her sister...yet. When his empire celebrated pregnancy in all forms, even granting Vixin the title of Goddess of Fertility out of respect, was it truly so wrong for her to birth a non-royal in such times? She felt her breaths ease.

She thought back to the moment Vixin had defeated her during their training, wondering how strong she had become during their time away. Again, her fear returned, forcing her to clench her fists as she forced the thought from her mind.

For several minutes she watched the flowing water, remembering the descriptions of her mother's corpse. Over and over, she used the image to spark her anger towards her sister, only for it to fall away into her accursed fear. She needed to defeat the traitor's daughter, did she not?

Could

she not?

Already she had sent word to her men in The Capital. Whoever this 'Fanir' boy was, they had reported his closeness to Vixin. Lord Salduin and Vixin herself couldn't be harmed, yet a slave was of no concern to her father. Would the pain of a slave hurt her sister? Would that balance the scale?

Digging the tip of her blade into the sand, Cendra sat down beside the water. She remembered the moment Vixin had come to her room, seeking an end to her animosity after gifting her the vibshir. They could have been true sisters then, she knew. Years of potential memories had been dashed by Cendra's anger.

Feeling the water touch her feet, Cendra dropped her facade. Safely alone, she couldn't help but choke back tears. ""Mother...I

hate

her...I think I..."" Her voice fell to a whisper. ""

Why won't you guide me?

""

The question forced a blush of embarrassment to her cheeks, despising the emotion she strained to force down. An imperial princess required strength. What was she? Did she deserve to be The God Emperor's firstborn when even the thought of swimming filled her with consuming dread?

A long moment passed as she sat in silence, listening to the water. A distant sense of someone approaching claimed her attention, scowling as she heard steps in the sand. Yet another reminder of Vixin's victory strolled towards her as she quickly wiped her eyes.

""Cendra?"" Irith's smooth voice came from further down the beach. Hips swaying, she held the hands of the twins as they walked beside her.

The God Emperor would never permit his love and heir to depart unguarded, and sure enough, Cendra sensed the Truthseekers creeping through the foliage, hidden as they prepared to defend their Concubine Empress. The princess had long since ordered her own protectors to grant her a wide perimeter, seeking solitude.

Zela marched happily along while Arinax nearly clung to his mother's hip, remaining as close as possible. When Irith sat down beside Cendra, only Zela moved to play in the sand.

""I do not wish to disturb you, yet there are things we must discuss,"" Irith said in her accent.

""Come to lecture me on legion command? I thought I had earned a break from such discussions,"" Cendra said bitterly, watching Arinax peer at her wearily as he held onto his mother's arm.

""Child, I believe we've bickered quite enough about that."" She shook her head. ""No, I've come to speak of your pregnancy. I'd like to assist you, yet you remain

here

, away from camp. Lord Clin has done his best with Cliax, though my grandchild needs his mo-""

""Yet he's not your grandchild, is he? You made that quite clear when you invited my sister into your bed.""

The cut of her words was evident upon Irith's face, a deeper blow than she had intended. The Concubine Empress required a moment before she could reply calmly. ""Alright Cendra. Alright. You're upset. If you'd like me to leave, I shall.""

Cendra remained quiet as she watched Zela explore, biting her tongue as she strangled the urge to apologize.

Irith sighed, moving to cradle Arinax as if he were far younger. ""I only seek to ease your burden. I know who sired your child, and what you must do to conceal that fact.""

Silver eyes widening, she glared at her father's mate. ""He...told you?""

""I know many of his secrets. Perhaps more than you dare consider."" Irith nodded. ""There is no shame in this, for what you've done is quite a beautiful act. Still, I admit that I gave your father more than an earful when he told me, for he should not have shamed Lord Clin in such a way.""

A mix of guilt and humiliation flooded Cendra as she blushed, her scowl deepening. She wanted to fade from existence, to kneel at Clin's feet and beg for forgiveness, yet a Vaid couldn't kneel.

Seeing her emotion, Irith attempted to place her hand onto Cendra's shoulder, only to have her shrug it off. ""There should be no embarrassment in this, for The Empire shall soon understand that such acts are as natural as the setting sun. Please, my dear, allow me to assist you through this. Allow me to be a mother to you.""

""My mother is dead,"" she replied, concealing one hand with her other as it began to tremble. ""I require no help.""

""Oh?"" Irith's flowing accent became flavored with a sudden passion. ""Child, there is much I could do for you. I know what you desire. I've seen you with the legion. I've witnessed your enthusiasm as you train to command them. You seek to lead a battle on your own? To prove yourself? I hold your father's ear. If you'd like, I may speak to him about granting you such an opportunity.""

Ears perking, Cendra turned her head to face her, finally meeting her blue eyes. ""You'd...do that?""

Irith nodded. ""You're a woman now. I was commanding my brother's men when I was younger even than you. It's time."" She returned her hand to her shoulder, and this time it remained. ""Yet a woman that spurns both family and allies is not ready to lead. If I am to speak to Dominax, I ask only that you allow me to assist you without this persistent resistance. Allow me to train you, to be at your side and assist you through this pregnancy. Let us attempt to be a family.

Please

.""

Anger slowly easing, Cendra nearly allowed herself to taste a hint of excitement. ""That would be...

acceptable

.""

Heart fluttering, Irith allowed Arinax to stand before she pulled the princess into a tight hug. Cendra's arms remained at her sides, offering little in return even as she felt an urge to melt into her grasp like a child.

""How will you do it?"" Cendra asked when they finally separated, maintaining a cold tone. ""The God Emperor's mind is rarely swayed, no less when his children's safety is concerned.""

""Just leave your father to me."" Irith smiled. ""For now, merely rest. When the time is right, we'll find a command that suits you.""

44th of Fixuin, 14 AVE.

Kingdom of Harin, Outside Littlexia.

""I've brought you a surprise, my love,"" Irith's sensual voice eased from her lips as she stepped into the bedchamber of the command tent.

Seated at the desk, Dominax finished etching his careful commands before sealing the message cylinders. With the ongoing siege of Littlexia in the back of his mind, he turned to regard her with a raised brow.

She crossed over to him, running her hands down his chest from behind as she lovingly nuzzled his neck. ""The children are asleep, my love, and I've found the perfect volunteer for tonight.""

""Ah."" An insidious smile crept across his face as he sensed his mate's eagerness. How many times had she brought him a female she herself had selected, seeking to watch him breed? Far too many to count in the months since she had confessed her hidden desires. ""My jealous little concubine isn't content to merely rest after today's battle?""",,2025-08-15T19:07:27.436023,3438,
https://www.literotica.com/s/carlys-wmaf-fantasy-pt-07,Carly's WMAF Fantasy Pt. 07,Unknown Author,,,,,"Glad you guys have liked these. I struggled with this one, trying to find the right tone and concept for things with Carly's sister. I rewrote it four times but I like how it came out in the end. Hopefully everyone enjoys it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

*****

The week passed by with some difficulty. Carly and I traded flirty text messages and talked when we were able. Both of us were very busy with work and neither of us wanted to pressure the other to give up on that. My consultancy was going through a big merger and my status as junior partner put me in a weird place politically within the combined company. Carly, on the other hand, had a massive game release that required her to work crazy hours managing all the bugs you'd expect with any major release. So our schedules were all over the place that first week back. I try not to spend too much time on Facebook but I was curious what each of the girls would do so I started the ball rolling by simply switching my relationship status from Single to ""It's Complicated"". What resulted was a hilarious and intricate dance of modern day social etiquette that anyone familiar with alternative lifestyles knows all too well.

Carly was the first one to follow suit, changing hers simply to ""In a relationship"" but not flagging who it was with. That didn't surprise me, I knew she needed time to deal with her parents and lay the groundwork. Nevertheless, she got a TON of responses from people (including her sister, I noted) asking about the guy. She played coy and didn't respond with much, other than the general positives like, ""He's amazing,"" and, ""I couldn't be happier,"" coupled with the more reassuring, ""He's got a steady job and he's not a deadbeat, Mom!""

At that point, a couple of our friends posted on my page with things like, ""Is it Carly?"" I didn't want to respond too hastily and reveal too much so I checked to make sure we didn't have any important overlapping friends (like her sister or my little brothers) but thankfully we didn't. For the most part, there was no cross-referencing but I was really getting worried and wondered if one of my friends would post something stupid on one of Carly's posts that her family would see.

It was late Tuesday night when things went crazy as Kyrsten came to Carly's rescue. Kyrsten changed hers and specifically listed me... then she flagged us as, ""In an open relationship"". A setting which, frankly, I didn't even realize was a thing. And at that point, our circle of friends exploded. I got four texts in about 120 seconds.

Jenn: What??? I'm confused... Are you still with Carly too? Is that the ""open"" part?? Please be good, Jay.

Roland: 👍👍

Kyrsten: I was trying to help, Master... I hope I didn't make a mistake.

Carly: Well... I guess I'm out of the woods. Enjoy your night explaining things. Lol.

Messenger on facebook blew up even worse. The instant I showed online, I had seven or eight messages from people. Apparently my Mom got a call. Remember kids, your parents made a lot of casual acquaintances with other parents while you were in high school. ESPECIALLY if you played sports. You're not keeping secrets from them.

Mom: Open relationship?!!?!???

Me: Uhhh... look... it's complicated, Mom. It's uhhhmmm...

Mom: You and I are NOT having this discussion on Facebook. Call me when you get your head screwed on straight!

Well... that went well. I decided to do broader damage control.

Me to Kyrsten: It's fine. Just trying to do some expectations management now. My Mom will be the big fire to put out.

Kyrsten: What about your dad?

Me: Are you kidding, I'm an adult now. He's going to high five me then pull me aside and tell me to handle things on my own with my Mom. He'll be Switzerland for awhile.

Kyrsten: Lucky you. My parents are divorced and I barely speak to them. They're not even friends on Facebook. I doubt I'll even get a phone call.

Me: I'm not sure which situation is better.

Kyrsten: Yours :(

Me: 🤗😘

Me: Gotta go put out fires.

Kyrsten: Nite, stud

Me to Carly: Yeah... this is fun. My Mom is pissed, Jenn sounds like she might be getting on a plane to knife me and Kyrsten WAS flipping out but I think she's okay now.

Carly: Good. You're good for her... You're good for everyone.

Me: :)

Me: I'll text you later. Gonna make sure Jenn doesn't murder me in my sleep.

Carly: I'll be teasing my clit all night thinking about you, Master.

Me: Teasing Bitch... 🍆

Me to Jenn: Carly and I are still together. Absolutely. I would say Carly is my girlfriend.

Jenn: And Kyrsten?

Me: Kyrsten is really special and we're trying to figure out what that is. It might be girlfriend too...

Jenn: Everyone always said nice things about you in school. In fact, even on your page people are saying nice (confused... but nice) things now. I hope you're not just using her as cheap fun.

Me: She's not that cheap (nono... delete, delete... rethink)

Me: I told her that I want to explore the relationship more and would leave it up to her but she also knows how I feel about Carly and she's okay with that.

Jenn: I hope so buddy. Kyrsten's got some issues if you haven't noticed.

Me: I have. Any advice?

Jenn: Treat her right. Show her that a relationship can be stable and worthwhile.

Me: Thanks. I'm really trying.

Jenn: I believe you.

Me: While we're at it... I hope things are going well with Roland. He's a keeper Jenn.

Jenn: 😳 I know

Me to Roland: Thanks for the moral support buddy!

Roland: You good?

Me: Oh yeah... my Mom is thrilled and YOUR new girlfriend sounds like she wants to scratch my eyes out.

Roland: Nahh... she's fine... Jenn I mean... can't help you with your Mom. Be grateful it ain't mine!

Me: Hah... yeah. Enjoy your night!

Roland: I will... Jenn just walked in... oh... yeah... she's not upset... gotta go man... good nite for me too!

Me: Lol... dick

After all that, I did some exercises to calm myself before calling my mom. Nothing helps clear the mind quite like some pushups and pullups that push you nearly to exhaustion.

""What the hell, Jay? An OPEN relationship? What the hell does that mean? Does it mean what I think it means?""

""Mom... let me explain, then ask all the questions you want.""

""Okay... but you better talk quick.""

""Before I start, I want you to know that I'm happy and so are the girls,""

""GIRLS?!?"" my Mom exploded.

""Mom... let me finish. Would you rather they were guys?"" I asked jokingly. Anyone with parents born in the 60s will understand that question's impact.

""Go on...""

""Do you remember Carly? She was the tall Asian girl that was almost Valedictorian. She and I... well.. We hooked up when I was down there this weekend.""

""You were in town this weekend and didn't come to see us?""

""Mom... Big picture..."" I said unbelievably having to refocus my mother onto her ""open relationship"" hysterics. ""I was visiting friends on a whirlwind trip. There wasn't any time. Anyway, Carly and I hooked up but then so did Kyrsten and I?""

""Honey, you've got to choose one. Don't be a cheating bastard like your uncle!""

""I'm not, Mom. I chose both. And both girls know and both girls are okay with that.""

""That's ridiculous. One of them is lying. Or they both are. No girl would be okay with that!""

My Mom was classic second wave feminist. I knew that there was ZERO chance she'd understand the real dynamic in these relationships. But maybe she'd understand it from a more modern approach. ""Mom, they're both grown women. They both know what they're doing. Neither wants to be tied down to a man right now.""

""Tied down perhaps"", I thought to myself before continuing, ""They want what they want and I'm really enjoying spending time with both of them. I don't know what will happen but they're the ones in control."" That last was simultaneously the most truthful and least truthful statement I'd made in a long time.

My Mom sighed. ""Look honey. I don't pretend to understand things with you and your friends. You're leading a different life than I led. Please be careful. Your heart and your bed are important to protect... and important to respect in others.""

""I know, Mom. You raised a good kid and I might surprise you but I will try to never disappoint you.""

""I know, honey. Get some sleep. Are you going to be able to see these girls soon. Kyrsten lives in Orlando still... where does Carlene live?""

""Carly,"" I gently corrected her, ""lives in Boston. I'm seeing her this weekend. She's introducing me to her sister who lives here.""

""Meeting the family already? It must be serious,"" she said, joking to lighten the mood.

""I think it might be, Mom... I really do.""My response caught her off-guard and she was silent for a moment.

""Be careful, honey,"" she said softly. ""I love you. Good night.""

""Love you too, Mom. Good night.""

I got into bed and saw an email from Carly. I opened it and there was an audio file attached. It was about ten minutes of her edging desperately. I had my pants off and was lying in bed quickly, stroking my shaft as I listened to her pathetic display. She was whispering, probably trying to keep her roommates from hearing how pitiful she'd become.

""Master, please. I need to be fucked. I need you to use my holes. You're the only man for me. No other man will ever have me if you wish it, Master. There's only one white cock in the world for this dumb Asian bimbo. I promise you can do whatever you want to me. Break me. Train me. Use me. Torment me. I'll edge every night and leave myself empty, stupid and desperate if you want, Master. Just tell me how to please you.""

There was a short pause where I heard movement and some soft grunting, when her voice started back, she was whispering even softer, the phone must have been pressed right up to her mouth. ""My sister is going to love your thick white cock in her tight concubine holes. I'll teach her how to please you. I know you'll enjoy her young, wet cunt and you can violate her ass as much as you want. I'll help you. I'll make sure she knows what she's good for, Master. And then she can be your little cumslut when I'm not there. Master? Will you... uhh... "" she gave a long groan before continuing, ""Will you make me eat your cum out of her, Master? Don't let me deny you anything you want, Master. If you make me, I'll eat her pussy or make her eat mine. I'll lick her ass. I'll make out with her. I'll do anything, Master. And if I say, no, I want you to slap me and force me, Master. I'm giving you permission. It's on this recording. I will NEVER deny my white owner, Jay, anything. Ever. I promise. He may use my body however he wants. For whatever he wants. I trust him.""

My cock was super hard as I stroked it in my fist. I could picture Carly kneeling in front of me, holding her sister's head on my cock. Talking to her. Telling her what she was to be for me. A concubine was the perfect word. A plaything. A set of holes for me to use at my convenience when Carly wasn't around. I stroked myself three more times and suddenly came, shooting everywhere. The sleep that night was blissful.

By the end of the week, Carly and I were both ready for the weekend. The nice thing about living in big cities is that the flights are super cheap. For $90, you can take an hour flight and be with your loved ones in just over two hours (traffic and security permitting). That gets even easier if you are an eager to please slut who doesn't need to pack clothes because she's going to spend most of the weekend on her knees and naked.

I emailed her Friday morning with a short list of things to bring. Nothing that would require her to carry more than a large purse or maybe a backpack. I didn't want to have to waste any of the precious time we had together. Her plane landed at 6:30 and we were breathlessly making out by 6:45.

""I've missed you so much, babe,"" I told her as I held her against the wall, heedless of the stares we were getting. Carly had dressed in a pair of short shorts, a tank top and a pair of wedge heels. Around her neck was a silk choker that was the icing on an already delicious looking cake.

""I can tell, Master,"" she murmured into my mouth between kisses as she ground her hips into me. ""I'm beyond desperate, Master. I don't know how I lasted without your glorious cock. I need it. I need it so bad.""

Another passerby came a little closer this time and heard the tail end. They probably thought she was some strung out junkie looking for a fix. We didn't care.

""You'll get it all weekend, slut. I'm going to use all your holes until you can't take anymore.""

""I'll never hit that point, Master. I'll never NOT be able to take your cock.""

""Good girl,"" I said as we untangled ourselves and clasped hands. ""What do you want for dinner?""

""Your cum,"" she said with a big grin.

""Seriously,"" I said, smiling back.

""I really don't care. Something quick so I can be filled up the right way as soon as humanly possible.""

""It can't be quick, slut,"" I told her. Her brow furrowed, puzzled.

""Why not, Sir?"" she said as people buzzed around us.

""It won't give me enough time.""

""Time for what?""

""Time to get to know your sister,"" I told her matter of factly. ""You're going to invite her to dinner.""

""You're going to start seducing her tonight?""

""No you dumb, silly slut. YOU'RE going to start seducing her tonight.""

""Oh my God, Jay... Sir... Master... "" she babbled before pulling close to me. ""I swear I've never gushed so hard. I love that you're just taking what you want from me... in every way imaginable.""

""I'm glad. Because, Carly, from now on, I own you. I have you on recording promising to give me anything and everything,"" I told her, doing my best to sound intimidating and threatening.

She simply looked me straight in the eyes and said, ""I know, Master. That's exactly what I wanted. I wanted to throw my hat over the wall and commit to you. Commit to us. I meant what I said. I trust you. I know that you would let me back out if I really wanted to. That you won't abuse it. But it's also really important to me that you understand, I intend to deny you nothing. Teach me to be perfect for you. And I will be, Master.""

I grabbed her and kissed her again as people hurried by us in the hallways, shooting us annoyed looks. ""Good girl. How long do you think it will take before I'm violating your little sister?""

""If she's like me? Maybe by the end of the weekend.""

""No. You'll have her riding me and giving herself to me by tomorrow night or you'll spend the next month edging without cock or orgasm.""

""Master? A month?""

""That's what I want. Are you complaining, slut?""

""No, Master. I would never complain. I just thought I might have misheard you."" She smiled sweetly.

""Words are hard for dumb little fuck bunnies,"" I told her with my most condescending voice. She giggled at me.

""I'll do everything I can to get my sister impaled on your cock, Master. EVERYTHING,"" she said emphasizing the last.

""No drugs. No forcing,"" I told her.

She looked at me before giving me a big grin, ""I know, Master. And it's the fact that you'd say that that reinforces my decision to trust you. I will do anything that you ask me to do. I also know you won't ask me to do dangerous or immoral things.""

""Outside of a little lesbian incest,"" I whispered with a grin.

""Lesbian incest isn't immoral for well bred Asian whores. It's just practicing for our strong, white Masters,"" she said letting just a hint of an accent into her intonation.

""Mmm... I like the way you think... When I'm not fucking you and turning off that little brain.""

We grinned at each other. The flirting and dirty talk just felt so natural to me and I could tell she felt the same. She picked up her phone and dialed her sister, ""Sherry? Hey. It's me. Yeah... I'm in the City. Can we take you to dinner? What? Who's 'we'? Uhhh... Yes... Yes... Yes, you can meet Mr. It's Complicated... Yes... No... Okay... Yeah, we'll meet you at Ippudo? Uhh... 7:30 or 8? Then we can go back to his condo and hang out... No... No it's not far... NO, he's not rich. East 68th... I'm sure you would... We'll see you in a few. Oh... wear something nice... don't dress like a total slut... Fuck off... bye"" she finished and hung up the phone.

""What was that last bit?"" I asked, confused.

""You want to see her dress slutty don't you?""

""Well yeah, but you said... ""

""You don't have sisters. Especially little sisters. I just guaranteed that she'll be the sluttiest girl there.""

""Well... second sluttiest, maybe,"" I said and I grabbed her ass. She squealed and leaned into me. We finally got out to the cars and grabbed an Uber. Getting over to Manhattan at this time of night was a painful experience. Worth it, but painful. Carly and I made out like teenagers in the car. Her pants were just loose enough that I could slide a finger up the leg and finger her wet cunt without taking them off. Which was good because in the mood I was in, they would have come off right there in the car. New York drivers are way more jaded than Orlando ones though so this one didn't even say anything. I'm sure he enjoyed the view but he knew better than to chance his tip on interrupting us.

We got there just before 8 and headed in. I tipped the driver who chuckled and said, ""I shoulda tipped you"" before driving off for his next stop. Carly and I laughed at the guy and his almost certain case of blue balls. That's when I caught sight of Carly's little sister. Don't get me wrong, Carly is hot as fuck and might just be the most beautiful girl I've ever scene. But Sherry was sex on wheels. She was short and stacked but unlike Kyrsten, who had that sort of athletic cheerleader build, Sherry was almost an obscene hourglass. And she knew it. She was wearing a short jean skirt and a cutoff shirt that showed off both her very large for her frame boobs and her super thin waist. This girl looked like she must train in the Dita Von Teese school of corsetry. She shook her hips as she walked over to us and gave Carly a big hug.

""Ohhh... I see why 'it's complicated' sis. Does Dad know?""

""She really gets to the heart of things doesn't she, Carly?"" I asked from behind my girlfriend. The hug I just witnessed already giving me ideas.

""Yeah... she's kind of a bitch that way... No, Dad doesn't know... and we're NOT telling him yet, okay?""

""You secwet'sa safe with me sistor,"" she said in a mocking asian accent. The change to the sing song rhythm surprised me.

""Don't be like that. Dad's gonna kill me isn't he?""

""No... he's mellowed. Probably just maim you a little,"" her sister joked. I was really starting to worry about their father. ""Oh... and hey... what's with telling me not to dress slutty when you're dressed like a Fobby Ho.""

""Am not,"" Carly said reflexively, then looked at me. I was just enjoying the sisterly banter between the two. ""Fine... maybe a little. Jay likes it when I dress a little... slutty.""

""Oh and you couldn't handle the competition? You know I can out slut you anytime old lady!""

""No... Jay likes eye candy and I knew you'd do the opposite of whatever I told you. I'm not worried.""

""Oh c'mon sis. You know all the white boys want this young asian pussy,"" she said. This girl was brash and blunt and I liked her a lot. I shot Carly a glance over Sherry's head. Carly just shrugged a little as if to say, ""she's weird... what can I say.""

As we walked inside, I leaned into Carly and whispered, ""What's Fobby?""

She whispered back. And as an aside, let me just mention how erotic it is to hear a woman you're fucking whisper in a sultry voice into your ear. Her voice hissed softly into my ear, ""F-O-B... Fresh Off the Boat, Master. Very insulting.""

""Oh,"" I said intelligently.

We sat down for dinner which was quite enjoyable. The restaurant was great and the Hibachi show was cheesy but well done. As we waited for our deserts, we got around to trading stories. Sherry seemed hellbent on trying to shock me about Carly's past.",,2025-08-15T19:07:34.470216,3659,
https://www.literotica.com/s/doctor-games,Doctor Games,Unknown Author,,,,,"I'm not as good as her, Rachel thought. I'll never have a figure as good as hers, or her looks.

She watched her husband flirting with the office secretary near the bar. James didn't seem to care that half his coworkers could see him embarrassing his wife. And he wondered why she'd scheduled a couples counseling session for tomorrow. Rachel imagined what he'd be saying to the slut if she weren't there. Would he be scheming to get an invite back to her place, or trying to take her to a motel? She let her mind wander. The young secretary down on her knees, waiting eagerly, her husband looking down at her, unfastening his belt. A flash of shame and excitement shot between her thighs.

The barroom lights kicked on, breaking the daydream. Rachel downed the last of her drink. The party was coming to a close. Roger, the man of the hour, had called it a night two hours ago. Not a bad sendoff, as far as retirement parties go, in Rachel's opinion. The fact that Roger was being forced out of the company against his will didn't seem to be bothering anyone. That's how it goes around here, she figured. You put all this time and effort into something you care about, but in the end someone younger and better still comes along to take your place.

She looked back toward the bar. James was standing alone now. His pursuit had ended unsuccessfully, apparently. Having his wife around probably hadn't helped his chances. He was scanning the room, looking for Rachel. Their eyes caught and he headed over.

""Ready to go?"" he asked, grabbing his blazer off the back of the chair.

""Yep.""

They headed for the exit.

James held the door open, which Rachel found hilarious. As if he hadn't just spent half the night hitting on some whore barely out of college. She stepped outside into the muggy summer night.

""Did you enjoy your conversation with your little girlfriend at the bar?"" she asked.

James sighed. ""Jesus, seriously? We're starting this again? I was just talking to her."" He smashed his thumb into the key fob several times, something he always did when he was on edge.

Rachel opened the car door and slid in. ""No, really, I hope it was a great conversation. All your coworkers seemed to think so. It should make for some great material at counseling tomorrow.""

""Whatever.""

Rachel looked out the window as they drove home, trying, and failing, not to imagine her husband with the secretary.

***

The couch in the therapist's room was dark brown leather. It matched the large mahogany desk and the ceiling-high bookcase beside it. Rachel gazed out the window at the pine grove. She knew therapists did well financially, but judging from the decor, this one did quite well. It was almost comically luxurious. The fully-stocked mini bar in the corner was the cherry on top. She half-expected Don Draper to stroll in smoking a Lucky Strike.

Rachel fidgeted on the couch. Couples counseling was her idea, but now that they were about to do it, she couldn't help being nervous. This doctor came highly recommended, but no one had shared any details on what to expect. James played on his phone, seeming bored already. She imagined him texting his secretary right now, getting dirty selfies from her as she tried to fix their marriage.

They both stood when the door opened. A woman walked in. If Rachel wasn't already intimidated enough by the decadence of the office, this woman sealed the deal. She looked to be in her late 20s, with long straight black hair, pulled into a tight ponytail. Her bust was about to bust through her white button-up, and the tight pencil skirt she wore showed off her obnoxiously seductive curves. The black-framed glasses completed the slutty librarian male fantasy look. Rachel was instantly jealous.

""You must be Dr. Westen,"" she said.

The woman flashed a smile that Rachel thought looked both welcoming and threatening. ""Please,"" she said. ""Call me Jane.""

""It's so nice to meet you, Jane,"" said James, extending his hand. The enthusiasm in his voice sounded like a child meeting his favorite sports player.

Jane gave James a feminine handshake, looking him directly in the eye. ""James, is it? Well, I could not be happier to have you here. I'm so glad you decided to give me a try. I know you won't regret it.""

Rachel cleared her throat. Was this woman hitting on her husband, in front of her, at couple's counseling, as their therapist?

""Welcome,"" Jane said to her, taking a seat at her desk without extending a hand to Rachel. She opened a file on her desk as the couple returned to the couch. Rachel watched her read over whatever was in it.

""Ah, yes,"" she said, not looking up. Jane flipped through several pages like that, seemingly ignoring Rachel and her husband while she read. Finally, she set the folder down and looked up, smiling again. ""So, after reviewing your file, I feel very confident-""

""I'm sorry,"" Rachel interrupted. ""Our file? How do we have a file? We've never been here before.""

""We do a very extensive background check on all our prospective clients Mrs. Jennings,"" said Jane, taking off her glasses. ""And, as I was saying, I believe your situation is well-suited to our expertise here, mine specifically.""

""Which is what, exactly?"" asked Rachel.

""Unfulfilled desires.""

""Excuse me?""

""Now,"" Jane said, putting her glasses back on, ""what I'm sensing from you, Rachel, is some insecurity about James's interactions with attractive females. I imagine this excites you on some level. That's something we'll expand upon.""

""Hold o-""

""And James, it seems like you have some needs that are not being met?""

""Uh, I guess I,"" he stammered. ""I mean yes. That's right.""

""Rachel, have you thought about your husband's needs?

""Um, I don't know. Aren't we moving a little fast here?""

""It's quite natural for married men to desire other women. Monogamy is only a recent human development, on an evolutionary timescale. In the past it was very common for high-quality males to have sexual relationships with multiple females. And James is a high-quality male. He may have desires for more attractive, or even more fertile women.""

A bolt of pleasure shot between Rachel's thighs, leaving her speechless. Her brain was overloaded with information. She noticed James fidgeting and grabbing the crotch of his pants; something he did subconsciously whenever he was getting turned on.

""We like to put new clients through an immersive session that helps us further target and address the specific psychological and sensory deficits. I feel very strongly that this session should take place as soon as possible. Today, in fact. If you're up for it.""

""We're up for it,"" James butted in.

""James, wa-,""

""Excellent,"" said Jane, leaning back in her chair and picking up her office phone. ""Rachel, oh, do you mind if I call you Rachel? Please let my assistant, Valerie, get you anything you need while I start the one-on-one session with Jame."" She pressed a button on the phone, ""Valeria, please escort Mrs. Jennings to the lobby and get her a refreshment.""

The door opened before Rachel could respond. A young, curvaceous woman appeared in the doorway and gently took Rachel by the arm, guiding her up off the couch and out of the room.

***

Valerie led Rachel into the lobby.

""Please, have a seat,"" she said.

The room was darker than it had been when they arrived. There was a water cooler in the corner near a potted palm. Rachel hadn't noticed it earlier. It had a sleek look to it that matched the modern design of the lobby. Dark red fruits that looked like elongated cherries floated in the water.

Valerie strode to the water cooler and filled a cup. Rachel couldn't help but watch the woman's hips as she brought it to her. Was everything here designed to make her think about sex?

""Here you go, sugar,"" she said.

As the woman handed her the glass, she reached down and brushed a strand of hair behind Rachel's ear, staring her in the eyes as she did it. Her lips were incredibly full, and Rachel found herself leaning towards the woman, but just before their lips touched Valerie pulled away, smiling.

Hotness bloomed across Rachel's face, and between her legs. ""Oh my god, I'm sorry, I don't know why I just did that. I-""

Valerie put her finger to her lips.

""Shhh, drink up,"" she said, putting her hand under the glass and lifting it up, encouraging Rachel to drink.

Rachel took a sip. Subtle hints of strawberry and lavender coated her tongue. She took another drink and tasted rose petals, and then honey. She finished the water.

Seeming satisfied, Valerie took the glass and headed for one of the lobby side doors. Rachel found herself almost drooling at the woman as she walked away. Why was she getting so incredibly turned on?

""Wait, what was in that?"" she asked.

Valerie turned, giving a flirtatious look over her shoulder before opening the door and leaving without a word.

***

Rachel sat alone in the lobby. The sound of the lights buzzing overhead filled her ears. She could still taste the strange fruit from the water, or maybe it was just the scent from the water cooler which seemed to fill the room now. It was intoxicating, and she felt like it was making her arousal worse. She was starting to get wet and she had no idea why.

The lights seemed to dim again. A sound of muffled voices came from Dr. Westen's office. Rachel suddenly felt a stab of jealousy. Her husband was alone in there with that slutty doctor who'd been hitting on him from minute one. She needed to know what they were saying.

Rachel did a quick look around to double check that she was alone. Then, being careful not to scoot the chair on the marble floor, she stood up and snuck over to Dr. Westen's office, placing her ear against the door. She heard her husband's voice.

""Oh my god, Dr. Jane, I'm so hard.""

""Yes, you are. Good boy, now drink the rest.""

Shame and jealousy shot through Rachel and made her gush. She covered her mouth, holding back a moan as she almost came right there, hearing her husband cheat on her with their therapist.

She stepped back from the door. She wanted to open it, wanted to see firsthand how much better this woman was than her. Wetness soaked her panties as the want became a need.

Trembling, she reached for the door knob. She grabbed it before she knew if she had the courage to open it. Then, all at once, she threw open the door to find her husband standing in the middle of the room with his pants at his ankles, downing a glass of water. Dr. Westen was on her knees in front of him with her luscious lips wrapped around his cock.

James dropped the glass when he saw his wife. It landed with a thud on the rug. He let out an incoherent moan as Jane took her mouth off his cock and smiled at Rachel. The doctor then stood, unzipped the back of her skirt, and slid it off, revealing her black lace panties and perfectly rounded hips. She walked to the door and led Rachel through the doorway by the hand, immediately pushing her up against the wall.

Rachel gasped, but didn't resist. Too many thoughts were going through her mind to form any words. Jane leaned in close until their lips were nearly touching, then stuck her tongue in Rachel's mouth. She felt the woman's tongue slide across the roof of her mouth, over her teeth, then over her upper lip.

""Tastes like inadequacy,"" she said.

Rachel felt herself being pushed to the floor. She obeyed, and suddenly the doctor's crotch was in her face. Jane held Rachel by the back of her head, smashing her pussy against her mouth and forcing her to eat her out through her panties.

""That's what I thought,"" she said. ""See how pathetic your wife is?""

The doctor pulled Rachel's head back by her hair and spit in her face. The insult sent Rachel over the edge. Her pussy spasmed as she came right there on the floor. She'd never been so utterly degraded and humiliated. It turned her into a soaking wet mess.

She looked up at Jane. The woman was laughing at her, seeing how inferior she was. She walked to her mini bar and grabbed a bottle of scotch, bringing it back to Rachel.

""Fuck yourself with it,"" she said, dropping it on the floor next to her.

Rachel's head spun. She didn't care anymore. She took the bottle, wiggled off her pants, pulled her panties to the side, and stuffed the head of the bottle inside her. She almost came again.

""Jesus,"" said Jane.

Her pussy leaked all over the bottle and the floor as she watched the doctor walk back to James. He was standing, cock in hand, right where she'd left him. The doctor placed her hands on her mahogany desk and bent over slightly, sticking her plump ass out.

""Jerk off to something better than that, James,"" she said.

James eagerly shuffled over to the desk behind her. He stroked his cock with enthusiasm as Jane swayed her hips back and forth for him. She pulled her hair tie out with one hand and shook her hair loose from the ponytail, letting it fall over her ass.

""There you go, James,"" she cooed. ""My ass is much better than your wife's face, don't you think?""

James's whole body twitched as he stroked his cock. He let out a groan.

""Oh god I'm so close,"" he said.

""Do it.""

""Oh fuck.""

James shot all over the woman's ass. The sight of her husband coming for another woman's body ruined Rachel. Her mind went blank as her pussy exploded around the scotch bottle. She came for a minute straight.

It was several minutes before Rachel regained herself completely. When she did, her husband was lying limp on the couch, slowly buckling his belt. Jane was straightening her skirt. She walked over to Rachel, looking down at her as she put her glasses back on.

https://www.literotica.com/s/fucking-my-girlfriends-aunt,Fucking My Girlfriend's Aunt,Unknown Author,,,,,"Author's Note: This story contains the usual futa on female stuff, with lesbian incest (though less of that than in The World). This takes place early on in the futa timeline, where futas exist but are rare and men still exist too, and incest is still quite taboo.

----------

Jade slowly opened the door to Zoe's room, creeping in to avoid waking her. Jade, the extrovert in the relationship, enjoyed being the center of attention at her frequent sorority parties, where she was typically the only futa in a room full of desperate women and a few jealous guys. Her girlfriend, Zoe, was fine with her fucking whoever she wanted - as long as she recanted the details to her when the two were alone together.

This was one such night. Despite Jade's best efforts, Zoe heard her footsteps, and quickly jumped herself awake, eager to hear of her futa girlfriend's latest exploits.

""Shit! Sorry babe I didn't mean to wake you,"" Jade apologized, seeing her nude, 20 year old girlfriend sit up. She stared at her tits as she sat down on the bed and undressed.

""It's fine, baby, I was hoping you would,"" Zoe confided as she unzipped Jade's dress, undoing her bra shortly after. ""How was it?""

""Not the best, not the worst,"" Jade replied, shedding her high heels, socks, and finally her panties, letting her enormous 10 inch cock free once again. It had a clear scent on it from the 5 or 6 women she'd had her way with earlier in the night.

""Who was the best?"" Zoe asked as she wrapped both hands around her girlfriend, using one to grab her tits and the other to start jacking her off.

""Damn, babe, it's 3am!"" Jade exclaimed, ignoring Zoe's question. Her cock stiffened nonetheless.

""What, you go fuck all those Greek life bitches and don't let me have anything after?"" Zoe interrogated as she increased the pace of her handjob.

""It's not that, i-it's just...I'm tired and my poor dick is tired,"" Jade replied as Zoe continued stimulating her lover, Jade's dick getting harder despite her protests..

""Then let me lick your balls at least,"" Zoe begged as she sat up and kissed the back of Jade's neck. Her strokes slowed down, but were more deliberate now. ""No dick.""

""No, that's ridiculous. How do you want it, babe?"" Jade replied, turning around to meet Zoe's kiss with a kiss of her own.

""I wanna taste everyone you fucked,"" Zoe moaned as she continued making out with the futa.

""Mmh yeah? You wanna see what your classmates taste like?"" Jade replied as she gasped in Zoe's mouth, feeling how good Zoe's handjob was.

""Yeah, but you have to tell me while I'm doing it,"" Zoe replied as she pulled the futa down onto the bed, and quickly jumped on top of her, getting in the perfect position to suck her cock.

""I d-don't know if I should babe, one of them was your friend..."" Jade moaned as she watched her girlfriend take at least half of her giant dick into her mouth with no trouble.

Zoe's mind was racing. Who could she be talking about? She thought about the sluttiest classmates she had.

""Who was it?"" Zoe inquired as she finally came up for her, stroking Jade's cock with both hands. Her mind darted to Chanel, an acquaintance of hers that was the typical sorority brunette. She pushed her head back down on Jade's dick, using her tongue to savor the juices that were still on it.

""Mmm....promise you won't get mad?"" Jade moaned as she watched her girlfriend at work.

This time Zoe stayed down on her dick for a few extra seconds, showing how eager she was to get as much of it down her throat as possible. ""C'monn, tell me!!"" Zoe replied as she began stroking Jade's dick and licking the head, making eye contact with her.

""I-it was...Angela,"" Jade confessed as she felt her orgasm nearing.

Zoe was shocked. Since they'd met her freshman year of uni, Angela had been her best friend. It wasn't that she was off-limits or anything, Zoe was just surprised that Angela would go for her (and vice versa).

""A-Angela? Really?"" Zoe paused, still stroking her but wanting to know more.

""Look, a bunch of the girls were egging her on, and I've always got along with her fine-"" Jade explained before her girlfriend cut her off.

""No, hey, Jade, it's fine - really. I'm just a little surprised,"" Zoe comforted her as she began licking up and down Jade's cock.

""You really don't mind babe?"" Jade asked sincerely, not wanting to cross any lines with someone who was already very tolerant of her promiscuity.

""Not at all,"" Zoe replied before diving back down on her dick, this time only getting a couple of inches from the base.

""Mmh, just like that... She was a nice fuck, probably the b-best I had tonight,"" Jade continued. ""She had me bend her over and take her that way, and I came inside her and it was really hot,"" Jade explained, nearing her orgasm from Zoe's oral work.

Zoe felt conflicted hearing this information. Her girlfriend just came inside her best friend? She was the best fuck of the night? Yet it was hot to know how much power Jade had over other women, even if it was women close to Zoe. She pressed on in her blowjob, despite gagging over the thick length multiple times.

""Oh fuck babe, just like that!!"" Jade exclaimed as Zoe started getting more and more into it, energized by her new horniness. Despite focusing so much of her energy on taking Jade's cock, Zoe slid her hand down between her legs and felt how wet she really was by the whole situation, and she began rubbing her clit in synch with sucking the futa's dick.

""Holy shit!!"" Jade exclaimed as she climaxed, shooting her cum directly down Zoe's throat, causing the poor girl to gag even more as she held it all down.

Zoe finally came up for air once the orgasm subsided. She was furiously rubbing her clit, and it was only a few seconds before she came, so turned on not only by her girlfriend jizzing down her throat, but also by her jizzing up her best friend.

""I think it's really hot that you fucked her, babe,"" Zoe confessed, laying her head against Jade's thigh.

""Really? I wasn't sure how everyone would feel... I guess you never specifically told me not to fuck your best friend,"" Jade continued, looking down at her girlfriend and running her hand through her hair a little. She thought of how lucky she was to have someone so accepting and so sexy.

""That's true, I'm glad I didn't,"" Zoe remarked. Suddenly a dirty idea popped in her mind.

""I also never specifically told you not to get a blowjob from my aunt,"" Zoe added with a smirk.

""Whoa, what?? Naomi??"" Jade replied, a little shocked at the insinuation herself. Zoe lived in a multigenerational household with her aunt, sister, and mom, and so Jade had become acquainted with the three of them plenty over the year they'd been together.

""I mean, she'd totally be down - she's asked me plenty about you,"" Jade explained, looking at Zoe's half-hard cock. ""Plus she's always been known to be a bit of a slut.""

Jade knew she was right. Naomi frequently went topless around the house, and didn't wear a whole out more outside of it. Jade sensed that she'd flirted with her a bit on previous occasions, but it was never overt enough for her to care one way or the other. Still...

""I can't believe you'd say that about your own aunt!"" Jade countered, envisioning the woman taking her length down her throat just as her niece did every night.

""What? She's totally more of a slut than Angela is,"" Zoe replied with a roll of her eyes.

""That would make things so awkward between you two!"" Jade insisted, though now she was picturing a stark naked Naomi drooling all over her dick while getting throatfucked.

""Mmh, maybe, but it's hot thinking about you doing it to people I know,"" Zoe encouraged as she kissed her girlfriend's cock a little. ""Especially knowing I have it all to myself in the end.""

Jade's cock hardened a bit at the sensation, but also at the thought of having her way with her girlfriend's aunt. She'd had countless women by now, being a young, beautiful futa, but the taboo nature of this one seemed especially enticing.

""How would it even work?"" Jade inquired. ""Usually I have to pull girls off of me, but with your aunt it's different since I know she'll be a little resistant.""

""C'mon, Naomi's the cool aunt - she's no stranger to something like that,"" Zoe insisted, noticing Jade's cock rising up more and more. ""And don't act like you don't know how to seduce anyone,"" she added as she put her hand on it, stroking it ever so gently once again.

""Mmh, is she gonna be home tomorrow?"" Jade asked, biting her lip a little as her dick continued to grow.

""As far as I know. I'll head out for a little to give you two plenty of time,"" Zoe assured her as she began to give Jade yet another blowjob.

""Fuck babe, that's so hot..."" Jade moaned and closed her eyes, but her ecstasy was interrupted by Zoe suddenly stopping.

""No more tonight. You'll have to have her finish the job,"" Zoe teased as she gave Jade's cock one final kiss before moving up to snuggle with her.

""You drive me fucking crazy sometimes,"" Jade complained as she held her girlfriend. Even though it was late, it took both women a while to fall asleep due to the excitement of the next day.

------

Zoe and Jade slept in late, on account of their late night lovemaking and plotting. It was destined to be a lazy Saturday, for Zoe anyways, as she had planned on just going to the library to study with Angela and leaving Jade to seduce her aunt.

""So are you gonna bring up...you know... that thing with Angela?"" Jade asked her girlfriend as the two of them got up and started putting themselves together.

""What thing?"" Zoe feigned ignorance.

""Me filling her up with my hot, futa cum,"" Jade replied emphasizing the last three words in an exaggerated fashion.

""Oh, that thing. Yeah it might make its way into conversation somewhere,"" Zoe replied, as she started to seriously ponder how she would handle it.

""Maybe you can tell her how good she tasted on my dick,"" Jade continued as she pushed her dick against Zoe's ass. The two were already showered and dressed, but Jade was still horny from being blue-balled the previous night.

""Naomi's gonna love how much cum you have,"" Zoe replied, ignoring her girlfriend's advances. ""That's one of the things she asked me about you.""

""Oh really? What else did she ask you?"" Jade asked as she now began groping Zoe's boobs instead.

""Will you just go fuck her throat already? Damn!"" Zoe replied as she pulled away from her girlfriend's tempting grip. She did give her girlfriend a goodbye kiss as she exited their room, on her way to have an awkward conversation with Angela.

Jade thought about the best way to go about getting what she wanted. Upon leaving the room, she realized that Naomi must have been the only one home - Zoe's sister and mom had to be out somewhere for the day already. Naomi's office job left her free most weekends, during the day at least.

""Mornin-er, uhh, afternoon Jade,"" Naomi greeted the futa from the kitchen. ""Not going with Zoe today?""

""N-no, just gonna relax here for a while I guess,"" Jade answered honestly. Naomi wasn't topless today, instead she had a bra on that mostly contained her luscious E-cup tits. Jade admired them nonetheless.

""Looks like it's just us then. Want a drink?"" Naomi asked, preparing one for herself already.

""Isn't it a little early for that?"" Jade replied, in the least judgmental way she could. ""Not that I'd deny one...especially from you.""

Naomi perked up a little, and smiled at her, a bit surprised at the forward-ness of the comment. ""I can make you a dry martini, that's what I'm having,"" Naomi offered as she finished making her own.

""When did you become such a bartender?"" Jade answered jokingly. ""Gag, that was terrible,"" she thought in her head. It was rare for her to be in a position where she needed to flirt with someone to get them to fuck her.

""It's one of those things men like in a woman,"" Naomi replied as she began fixing Jade's drink. ""Not that you would know...at least, I don't think?""

Jade feigned ignorance. ""What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know?""

Naomi looked a little confused, a little nervous - she wasn't sure how to handle the situation. ""I mean...sorry, I just thought most of your people weren't into guys,"" she clarified as best she could.

""Which people is that?"" Jade continued with the act, hoping it would lead somewhere.

""I mean, f-futas,"" Naomi finally spit the word out.

""You've clearly never met another one. We prefer 'futanari,'"" Jade lied through her teeth at the poor woman.

""Oh I'm really sorry Jade, it's just - I honestly haven't, and I really didn't know!"" Naomi answered honestly as she set her own drink down. ""But that's good to know.""

""Did you know the average length of the futanari penis is 9.5 inches?"" Jade replied much more seriously, this time making eye contact with the older woman. ""I know you've been asking Zoe about it,"" she continued.

Naomi was clearly very flustered about all of this. She was worried that she'd embarrassed herself and offended Jade, which was all the worse considering how attracted she was to her.

""I...well, I was just curious..."" It was Naomi's turn to lie.

""Why don't you take it out and find out how big it is, you little slut,"" Jade commanded, immediately picking up on Naomi's submissive streak.

Naomi, nervous but dripping wet, swiftly made her way around the counter to Jade, stopping a foot away from her. She noticed an obvious bulge in the futa's sweatpants.

""Y-yes, o-of course...."" Naomi confirmed after her brief hesitation, getting down on her knees despite the hard wood floor.

""Damn, this ended up being pretty easy after all,"" Jade thought to herself as Naomi pulled down her sweatpants down. She was greeted with a beautiful, long cock - the same one that had fucked her niece and countless other women. Naomi could hardly believe it - it was at least two inches bigger than any she'd ever had, not to mention thicker.

""Like what you see?"" Jade teased as she grabbed onto it and lightly slapped Naomi's face with it. Naomi was still stunned as she could just stare with her mouth open a little.

""Oh God..."" Naomi marveled as she moved her head to examine it at all angles, before doing the same to Jade's balls. ""Can I suck it?"" She pleaded, looking up at the younger futa.

""Lose the bra. I like seeing you walk around topless. I wanna see your spit fall down on those tits while you're blowing me,"" Jade commanded, now knowing she had the poor woman in the palm of her hand.

""Y-yes, of course,"" Naomi replied as she immediately reached behind and unsnapped her bra, leaving her great rack on full display.

""Do you walk around here like that because you want me to fuck you?"" Jade asked, gazing at the woman's cleavage from her high angle.

""I....well, like I said, I was just curious...."" Naomi replied, as her hand went to Jade's cock. She started stroking it slowly, still having not been given permission to suck on it.

""God, you're even more of a slut than I imagined. Why don't you show me what you can do?"" Jade inquired, as Naomi immediately shoved as much dick down her throat as she could muster. Jade put her hands around Naomi's head to lock her in place, and push her back down when she tried to come up for air.

Jade was now in her groove; she didn't think herself a master of seduction, but she knew the right ways to be rough with women who wanted her. Naomi's pussy was on fire as the futa throat fucked her, the sounds of their sex filling the empty house.

""Fuck, you're pretty good at this,"" Jade moaned as she continued using her girlfriend's aunt. Spit poured out of Naomi's mouth and onto her luscious tits, and her eyes watered as she looked up at the dominant futa.

It started to set in for Jade how hot it was that she was getting blown by Zoe's aunt. She imagined taking turns with them, fucking both of them right after the other. But her mind drifted to other places too. She knew Zoe's sister Arabelle was similarly ""open-minded,"" that is, she could probably be convinced.

Jade continued daydreaming, knowing that Arabelle was certainly going to be harder to win over than Naomi, but still the thought of taking her was sexy in its own taboo way. She wondered if Zoe would bring it up after she told her about throat-fucking Naomi.

Jade's slutty daydreaming was interrupted by Naomi pulling away from her grip, spilling spit all over her tits once again. She'd held the poor woman on her dick for at least 30 seconds, and Naomi finally had to come up for air. She gasped and caught her breath for a few seconds before going right back to sucking.

""You're a real blowjob machine aren't you, aunt Naomi?"" Jade commented at the older woman's enthusiasm. Naomi simply looked back up at her and let out another gagging sound, holding the futa's dick securely within her throat.

After sliding her throat up and down on Jade's cock, Naomi pulled up for her two seconds of air once again. ""Am I better than Zoe?""

Jade was taken aback at the forward-ness of her new slut. ""Did you really just fucking ask me that?"" Jade barked, pulling Naomi off of her dick by her hair.

""S-sorry, that was inappropr- I shouldn't have asked that,"" Naomi apologized, looking up to the futa for approval.

""You're nothing but a big titted whore, got that?"" Jade degraded her, not usually something she got off on, but she could tell how desperate Naomi was and she was also pissed off about the question in general.

""Y-yes Jade, of course, I'm so sorry,"" Naomi continued to apologize, hoping she didn't ruin her chance to make the futa cum down her throat. ""I know that she's the best and that I'm just a slut,"" she continued, rubbing her hand up Jade's leg a little.

An idea popped into Jade's head. She grabbed Naomi's phone from the counter, still holding her head in place, and started taking a video recording.

""Why don't you say that again, slut?"" Jade taunted the woman, focusing the video on her sloppy looking face.

""I know that Zoe is the b-best and I'm just some slut,"" Naomi repeated, her cunt now dripping from embarrassment but also how dominant the futa was.

""Then get back to sucking,"" Jade commanded, as Naomi resumed her blowjob. Jade let the video run for a few more seconds, before stopping it and clicking away.

""I'm sure Zoe will appreciate that,"" Jade commented before sending the video to her girlfriend. Naomi's pussy flushed once again and, despite not meaning to, she came came at the mere thought of her niece seeing it, not to mention her having a huge cock in her mouth.

Jade didn't notice. She was getting close to her own orgasm as she put the phone down and held onto Naomi by her hair, guiding her up and down on her dick.

""Fuck, I'm close. Lick my balls, bitch,"" Jade barked, as Naomi desperately tried to open her mouth further to let her tongue stick out and obey the futa's order. Jade continued sliding the woman up and down on her dick, waiting to see if she'd be able to manage it.

Just as Jade was going to cum, Naomi finally pushed her tongue out of her mouth, giving Jade's balls lots of licking as she continued to milk her cock. This sent the futa into overdrive as she let out a loud moan before filling her slut's throat full of her cum.

""Oh fuck yeah, just like that!"" Jade screamed, interrupting the muffled sounds of Naomi's gagging. The poor older woman had never been subjected to such an aggressive throatfuck, such a huge dick, or such a big load, but she loved every second of it.

Naomi's eyes were watering as she felt Jade's cum spraying down her throat. The futa pulled out a few seconds later to give her another 3 or 4 good shots in her mouth, and then several more on her face and tits. By the end of it, she was a sloppy mess - covered from the belly up in cum and spit.

""Was that enough cum for you?"" Jade taunted, relishing in her work.",,2025-08-15T19:07:49.845080,3566,
https://www.literotica.com/s/cuckquean-the-making-of-a-quean,Cuckquean - The Making of a Quean,Unknown Author,,,,,"""Ugggg, I don't know what to pack for tonight."" Jennifer said out loud to herself. Her husband was in the shower so she was alone. Jennifer and her husband Mitch were getting ready for a long but fun day. Mitch's brother was getting married today and even though it was a local wedding they would be staying in a hotel that evening to allow both Jennifer and Mitch the ability to drink and enjoy the night without having to worry about driving back home.

Mitch and Jennifer had been married two years and a few months. They loved each other dearly, always supported each other, and had a great communication. The later skill had been helping as the past few months they have been trying to improve and spice up their sex life. Neither of them could pin point the reason but lately Jennifer has had trouble reaching a full orgasm. They were both good looking people and hadn't let their bodies go since being married like some of their friends but something lately just wasn't clicking between them during sex.

Before the talks they had regarding the sex and the lack of excitement lately, Jennifer was always confident but very conservative about the way she dressed out in public and even in the bedroom. She wasn't a prude as she would wear two piece bikinis in the summer and had more thongs and lace panties than the boring comfortable type but they were always basic sets. Mitch had brought up the fact that he would like to see her enjoy her body as much as he does so for the past few months she had been buying more lingerie and spicy bra and panties sets, even going as far as wearing them under her normal work attire to get used to them and hopefully few more sexual through it all.

At times they helped and the attention Mitch gave her in them was great, but it still only lead to mini orgasms and Jennifer still feeling that she was unable to fully feel sexual bliss. Jennifer had to admit to herself though that she did look good in them. She was 5'7"" to her husbands 5'11"" build, and her 34c breasts usually always looked great in the new outfits she was buying. Her ass wasn't huge like some of her friends but with working out and the stairs she had to walk up and down daily for work she had a nice tight plump ass on her. Her brown eyes and long brown hair that went past her shoulders were currently looking amazing as she went to the beauty salon the day before to get ready.

As she stood there in her closet looking for what to bring for the hotel after the wedding she was torn. She recently just bought a royal blue corset and lacy blue thong to go with it and was thinking about packing that for the night. She had a few other options as well that Mitch really enjoyed when she wore them recently but she was still looking for that one WOW outfit. While digging in her drawer in the back she found her wedding night lingerie. Nothing to fancy just a see through white silky gown and a white thong that she thought to herself probably would look better on her now than her wedding night.

She worried that it would be to weird to bring and wear on the same night his brother would be married to a beautiful woman probably wearing something similar, well at least in color, as the brides body was a bit different than hers. The bride to be was shorter than Jennifer but her body was definitely thicker. She would strut around with her 36DD breasts at all events and she could only imagine how the bride to be would make sure they were popping for her big day.

She heard the shower stop so she panicked and threw the blue outfit, her wedding night outfit, and a new pink bra and panty set she bought but hadn't used yet in a bag and decided she would make her decision later that night.

Once Mitch was out of the shower he had to finish getting ready quickly and head out as he needed to go help his brother with some day of the wedding tasks before they all got ready to head to the venue for the wedding. Luckily it was at a hotel anyways so it made there day and night easier and Jennifer would be able to check in and get herself ready at the hotel before the wedding.

After getting ready, discussing the plan for today, and saying goodbyes with a long tender kiss, Mitch set off to go meet his brother for his big day. Jennifer was able to take her time and get ready, did some straightening up around the house and before she knew it, it was time for her to head out and go to the venue/hotel. She grabbed her dress for the wedding, the bag that included her makeup, hair product's, and the few choices of outfits for the night she headed out.

On the drive over she was still contemplating which one to wear and which one would have Mitch the most excited for hopefully a good night of sex and love making. She arrived with still no decision made and was starting to get frustrated with herself on not being able to get out of her own head with it all. She knew other woman from work and her personal life who had friends they would go to with these questions but she never had that confidence or relationship with any of her current friends. That bummed her out at times but also she didn't want to talk about this with others and them think she isn't a good wife or lover.

Jennifer checked in, since they purchased their room with the wedding party blocks of rooms she was able to get the room before the normal 3pm check in time. That was great because the wedding started at 3:30pm. Once checked in she sent her husband a text to she how he was doing and received a response that his brother was nervous and excited so they were keeping him distracted by playing video games. Boys will always be boys she thought.

Around 2pm she finally started to get ready. She got her makeup done, hair straightened, and her beautiful purple dress on that came up to her upper thigh when she sat down. She realized she had to watch it from riding up as this dress was shorter than she would normally buy, but wanting to show off a bit more for Mitch she decided it would be perfect for the wedding. She added one of her normal bra and panties set as they matched her dress perfectly and knew that Mitch would get a better outfit later, even though she hadn't decided which one yet.

At 2:30 she received a text from Mitch that they were downstairs and the wedding planner was having the practice their walks down the isle and the first dance set up for the wedding party before it got started. By 2:45 Jennifer was fully ready and looked at herself in the mirror. Even though the dress was more revealing than she normally wore she felt sexy and confident in it. She decided to head down and see Mitch before the wedding and see how handsome he was in his groomsman tux.

She got downstairs and checked outside on the patio area to see if the group was still practicing the walk down the aisle. As she walked around she noticed other couples and family members saying hi as she told them she was looking for Mitch. Mitch's aunt told her they were in the ballroom doing last minute run through on the first dance for the wedding party. Jennifer thanked her said bye for the moment and went to go check on her husband. When she got to the ballroom she was stopped in her tracks.

The room was beautiful and looked amazing. Streamers were set down in the doorway and the tables, walls, and overall setting was just stunning. After taking that all in she finally noticed the group in the back of the room. She was still a good distance away and didn't want to interrupt the run through so she stayed in the back next to the bar. She glance at the pairings of people dancing until she finally saw Mitch.

That's when she saw him air dancing with a bridesmaid as the wedding planner was going around telling them the timing on everything. As she was in the back no one had noticed her yet and she took the time to just look in awe at her husband. She noticed that Mitch and his partner were dancing but doing it from a safe distance as to not get to close it seemed.

As the wedding planner was going around she got to Mitch and his bridesmaid partner. She looked about the same age as them, 27 (Jennifer) and 28 (Mitch), with long blonde hair, a nice tight body that the blue dress she wore really held tight to showing off her nice breast and butt, with her dress ending a bit lower than Jennifer's dress. She looked to have a wedding ring on her finger which would make sense as why her and Mitch were dancing so uptight together which made Jennifer smile as she knew her husband would never tempt himself with another woman.

The wedding planner seemed to comment about how far they were dancing from each other based off hand movements and the fact that both of them started to get closer with her hands on their backs seemingly pushing them together. Moments later, Jennifer was now watching her husband and this blonde beauty dancing very closely together with some of the moves bringing the blonde's gorgeous body right up onto Mitch's. The two began to dance a little more freely and she could Mitch's hands now move across the blondes back and to her hips.

Jennifer, who was still standing by the bar a good distance away, now was starting to feel weird. Not about how Mitch was touching and feeling on the beautiful blonde but at how it made her feel. She thought at first it was jealousy that Mitch was feeling up on this woman she didn't even know but she also couldn't stop staring at the two. As they danced more, Jennifer couldn't figure out what this weird feeling was but the more she watched the more she realized that she was enjoying the action.

After a few more minutes the wedding planner stopped them all from dancing and had them come to her so she could talk about more details. Jennifer assumed that now that they had stopped dancing she would be able to get ahold of what this weird feeling was. She became internally confused as now that they had stopped she felt disappointed that she was no longer seeing Mitch and the blonde touching each other. She was lost in her own thoughts which is why she never noticed that she was joined but a woman to her right that once she spoke finally brought Jennifer back to reality and noticing that she had company next to her.

""So which one of those handsome men in tux's is yours?"" The woman asked.

Jennifer now back to get normal thoughts turned to looks at the woman. She was stunned right away with her beauty. She had blonde hair like the bridesmaid she was just watching but it was curled up at the ends and the length ended right below her shoulders. She had deep green eyes which matched the dress she was wearing. The dress was a perfect accessory to show off her breasts and long legs as it was low cut to show off her 32D breasts and short enough to show the bottom of her amazing thighs all the way down to her heels.

""Oh, mine is the one what was dancing with the blonde haired girl closest to us."" Jennifer said regaining her composure and trying to get the thought of her husband and the blonde being so close to each other out of her head.

""Well isn't he a lucky man."" The woman said. ""I'm Amber by the way.""

""Hello Amber, I'm Jennifer, and yeah she is a lovely woman to be dancing with. Don't know who she is though as she is a friend of the bride and I'm from the grooms side."" Jennifer said trying not to sound jealous as she wasn't, right?

""Oh no honey. I meant to have you. You look stunning today. Just don't go showing off to much or the bride will be upstaged."" Amber said looking a Jennifer with a smile on her face.

""Thank you Amber. That is so sweet. I have seen the bride though so I know that can't be true. You look amazing yourself too."" Jennifer said smiling and feeling a bit more beautiful and sexy now that she received that complement.

Jennifer looked back to the wedding party and had noticed they began to file out and she didn't even get to say hi to her husband. Amber noticed the look and thought maybe this woman was feeling a bit insecure now that she just watched her husband dancing with a beautiful woman in this gorgeous venue. ""Why don't we have a drink to celebrate the day and the couple. Seems like we both just get to enjoy the show so why not use the open bar to its fullest.""

Jennifer smiled and the woman and thought why not. She was right she didn't have anything to do really on the day and since she was not part of the wedding party and the table for them was smaller she would actually be sitting through the event with all the other guests as he husband would be with his brother. ""Sure but let's start small as this is going to be a long event and I can't be stumbling around to much before the evening."" Jennifer said and turned around to walk to the bartender.

Amber watched her walk away and then began to follow. She loved going to her friends and co workers weddings. As she was single she always had the ability to pick out the person she wanted to leave with that night. Amber was bisexual but had preferences. Her current flavor of the month though was woman, specifically married woman with handsome husbands.

This desire started a few months ago when she was away for her home on business and went to a bar. There she met a beautiful woman and her handsome husband who were out that night celebrating their anniversary. She ended up having a long discussion about them which included their lives, work, travel spots, and towards the end of the conversation turned to Amber's love life.

As the drinks were flowing and the couple were obviously enjoying themselves, as Amber would notice the husband rubbing on the wife's ass and her making slow movements under the table on his lap, Amber decided to be open and told them about her being bi and her past few enjoyable nights. The couple was amazed at how open Amber was and ended up opening up themselves. Amber told them she needed to step away and use the restroom but would be right back.

As she walked back to the couple in the booth awaiting her she noticed that the wife had taken the time to play and tease each other and she could see the wife rubbing her husbands cock through his pants. Just from the outline she knew this handsome man had himself a thick long dick and began to get a little jealous that she would probably end her night in her hotel room fingering herself while this beautiful wife was going to be railed by that cock.

When she returned to the table the talk got even spicier. With the benefit of liquor and the hot scenes that Amber had told them about they told her a secret of their own. They told Amber they had always wanted to try a threesome and while she was in the bathroom they agreed that Amber would be the perfect woman to try that with.

Amber had done threesomes with other women in the past so she wasn't a newbie there and as she was also horny from the conversation and had no reason to say no she agreed to going back to their place. That night was one that brought a new desire to Amber she never knew she had. When they got to the couples house they all began to make out heavily as they made their way to the master bedroom. It started out simple with the wife going down on Amber and her returning the favor as the husband watched.

Once both women brought each other to an orgasm and noticing the wife's more submissive attitude through the oral session something clicked inside Amber's head and she became more dominant towards the wife. That rest of the night had the wife taking the husband's place and watching only as directed by Amber. Amber sucked, fucked, and got filled up with this man's cum as she had the wife watch. She enjoyed the ability to control this woman while she was fucking her husband. She felt like she enjoyed the control of the wife as much as the feeling of the husband pounding into her.

That night she orgasmed multiple times and before she was finished she had the wife bring her to one more orgasm as she had her eat her pussy and taste her husbands cum inside of Amber. Amber was on the pill so she knew she wouldn't get pregnant but that didn't stop her from telling her new submissive pet to eat all the cum out so he didn't knock her up.

That experience led to a few more before this night, usually on a business trip and once with a neighbor and her husband after a long day at the pool at their home.

She came to find out this was called cucking but not the normal way where the wife fucked another man or woman but rather cuckqueaning where the wife watched her husband with another partner. Getting the ability to go to her coworkers wedding today gave her the chance to meet a couple she hoped to introduce to this new lifestyle.

Lucky for her as she got there early and headed to the bar she saw a beautiful brown haired woman staring at her husband with the look in her eyes she had seen many times when she would sit a woman in the corner of the room and watch her get sexually pleased by their partner.

Back to the present Amber walked and got to the bar and both herself and Jennifer ordered a drink. They noticed the time right after and agreed they needed to take this first one quickly to make sure they got seated for the wedding. The talked some about work and how they knew the bride and groom.

After finishing their drinks they hurried to the lawn area and were able to find seats to the side and they decided to sit next to each other as Amber came alone and Jennifer's husband would be up at the front being a groomsman.

""You know there is no need to be worried about the blonde bridesmaid. Her name is Daisy and her husband is the cute hunk of a man three rows in front of us."" Amber said trying to test out the waters of this woman.

""Oh I wasn't worried. I know Mitch wouldn't cheat on me, I was just in awe of how great everyone looked."" Jennifer said not a lie as everyone did look amazing she just left out the fact that she seemed to enjoy how close her husband got to Daisy.

The wedding was now just about to start as the music started and the priest started to thank everyone for coming. The ceremony started and Jennifer and Amber talked quietly to each other as the pairs started walking down the isle. Jennifer seeing Mitch walking arm in arm with the blonde brought back those weird feelings again.

She knew now that it's wasn't that she was jealous but she didn't know. She told herself that Mitch looked so handsome and somehow sexier with his blonde partner on his arm. She was lost again in her thoughts and as before was brought back to the present with Amber's voice.

""Is that a look of jealousy or a look of lust?"" Amber whispered into Jennifer's ear. She was shocked by the comment but also shocked at how her body reacted. She got a quick chill down her spine and felt the hairs on her neck stand up. She heard the question but didn't know how to respond. Between taking that first drink so quickly, being dressed up as she was, and her building anticipation to be alone with her husband she quickly turned to Amber and whispered back ""Maybe a bit of both.""

She realized in that statement she was yes jealous, not of her husband or Daisy but of not being able to see them together. She didn't know why but she was starting to imagine how great they would look together naked. She shook her head quickly and tried to remember how much the bartender poured in her drink as she must be getting drunk having weird thoughts like that.

""Well don't stare to much or those purple panties of yours will be soaked before the I Do's."" Amber whispered again into Jennifer's ear.

Jennifer took a moment to process what was just whispered into her ear as she again felt her hair stand up on her neck and another chill down her spin but also the feeling she hadn't had since before gettin with Mitch. She felt like she had butterflies in her stomach.

As she processed the statement and was going to respond she finally noticed Amber was right, she was starting to get wet. And then it hit her. She heard her say purple panties. How did she know. She looked straight down to see her dress and check if her ass was out. That was the only way Amber could know right?",,2025-08-15T19:07:55.130800,3784,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-pledge-part-7,The Pledge (Part 7),Unknown Author,,,,,"The genie was out of the bottle, we had fucked and now we couldn't stop. The rest of the week and weekend we were fucking every chance we got. We were trying out every position, seeing which ones work best for us. We fucked until I was shooting blanks in her pussy then fucked more. It was the best sex I've ever had, I don't know if sex with anyone else could even possibly compare. Doggystyle, cowgirl, missionary; it all felt so intense and primal with her. Something had been unlocked in her by the last few weeks and I was loving it.

By the start of the next week we were both so thoroughly exhausted that I spent my first night in my room in 3 days. That same day she went to her meeting so it worked out for both of us. I fantasized about what we would be doing together next, the sex was only getting better and this would just unlock another skill for her to use with me. That night I recharged, enjoying some alone time and fantasizing about the message I would be getting soon.

Finally, the message came, a screenshot of Katy's message:

""10. Fuck in public 11. Skill evaluation""

""Skill evaluation?"" I responded

""Idk"" she sent back ""they just said we both hav to meet with 1 of them to evaluate my growth""

""When are we gonna meet?

""tmrw night?""

""Works for me""

""Wanna do 10 now 😉?""

My heart jumped in my chest, maybe she's surpassing me a bit. Having sex in public is a lot. I mean...I guess I wouldn't mind having sex with her...

""Yeah ;) where?""

""Meet me at the library 😉 😉 😉""

I raced across campus to the library. It was pretty quiet because it was getting toward closing time. I figured she would want to fuck somewhere around there since most people wouldn't be walking around outside the library this late. When I saw her waiting by the entrance I called out her name, expecting her to walk over to me. Instead she smiled and waved me over, starting to open the door.

""Where are you going?"" I asked ""Aren't we gonna go somewhere to fuck?""

Yes, daddy,"" She said with a mischievous smile. ""The stacks are pretty empty this time of night.""

""Are you crazy?"" I asked, my eyes going wide. ""We could get in serious trouble if someone catches us.""

""Then don't get caught,"" She said with a wink as she walked through the door.

Fuck, I guess. It's pretty late there's barely anyone here - plus I really want to fuck her. I tentatively followed behind her through the door. She walked a bit ahead of me, her short pink skirt just barely blocking my view of her ass. She was wearing the ""squeeze me"" shirt again, I'm sure enjoying the humiliation of knowing that people recognized her from the videos going around of her being groped by a mob of drunk students. As we walked by a group of students studying at the desktops on the first floor I noticed a girl get her friend's attention and point at Rayna, both of them letting out stifled laughs. Rayna didn't let on that she noticed but really there's no way she didn't -- they weren't very subtle.

As we made our way down the main stairs I looked around, seeing if anyone was in the basement. The tables were largely empty, aside from one person sitting in the corner far from the stacks. As we got closer to the start of the bookshelves Rayna slowed down, closing the distance between us until I was right next to her. She looked at me with a sly smile as she grabbed my hand and raised it to her tit. I frantically looked around to make sure nobody was around, eliciting a naughty giggle from her. As I looked around she slid her hand down and grabbed my cock, causing me to jump. Looking satisfied with herself that she had turned the tables on me she grabbed my hand, dragging me forward into the stacks.

About halfway down the main walkway between the shelves she let go of my hand and started to strip as she walked. She removed her shirt first, revealing the slightest curve of her perky tits visible from behind. She kicked off her shoes one at a time, bending down to grab them and revealing her tits as they hung freely. Bending over still she pulled down her mini skirt, pulling it off and leaving herself only wearing a pair of white socks. She turned around, letting me see her body in its full glory as she walked backward, deeper into the hopefully abandoned stacks. Any concerns about being caught left my head as my cock swelled in my pants.

Finally, she disappeared into one of the final rows of bookshelves, far from the tables people study in. I turned the corner to find her already on her knees with her tongue stuck out lewdly. She pulled me toward her by my waistband and roughly pulled down my sweats and boxers in one move, revealing my already hard cock. Slowly stroking it with one hand she set up her phone so it could record us. Wrapping her second hand around my shaft she licked the head as she slowly stroked up and down. Her plump lips wrapped around my tip, lightly sucking as her tongue stimulated its heart shaped underside.

Pulling the cock out of her mouth with a loud pop that brought me back to worrying for a moment, she looked up at me and said, ""Lay down, daddy, I want to ride.""

Brought back into the moment by her request I laid down so she would still be visible on the camera. Squatting over me she grabbed my cock and lined it up with her pussy. As she sunk down onto my rock hard shaft she let out a low moan before seemingly thinking better of it. She covered her mouth with both hands, pressing her forearms tightly to either side of her tits, squeezing them together, as she began to grind hungrily. My tip was rubbed on all sides by the walls of her pussy as she moved her hips back and forth. She was clearly struggling to keep quiet as she rode me, her face turning red from the effort and her hands pressed hard against her face. As she ground her hips faster I felt the muscles start to squeeze hard as she orgasmed. Her moans began to escape from between her fingers as her eyes rolled back. Collapsing on top of me she started bouncing her ass up and down, twerking as she buried her face in my shoulder, still in the throes of an orgasm.

Her stifled moans filled my ear as her pussy contracted around my cock, bringing me close to the edge. I grabbed her ass with both hands, sliding it up and down my shaft like a fleshlight. As I felt myself get closer I began to fuck back into her, meeting her strokes with my own, letting her ass slap into my thighs with loud wet smacks. I closed my eyes as I felt pleasure wash over me. With a deep guttural groan I filled her with my cum, holding down her hips so my cock was buried as deep as possible inside her. Waves of warmth radiated through me as she continued grinding, pulling shot after shot of cum out of me.

Finally my orgasm subsided and I opened my eyes to see her doubled over, her blushing face just inches from my own, then, as my eyes refocused, the bookshelves towering over us. I completely forgot where we were. How loud were we being? My questions received a quick answer as I heard footsteps coming down the main aisle of the stacks. We looked at each other with wide eyes, before both scrambling to gather our clothes and duck into the strip of walkway by the far wall. We ducked behind a shelf, hurriedly putting back on our clothes. I peaked around the shelves to see the librarian walking down the main aisle with her head on a swivel, presumably looking for us. Ducking back around the corner I gestured to Rayna that she was right there. I held her tight to me as we waited, hearts pounding. As her steps passed us going farther back into the stacks we crouched and hurriedly made our way back to the study area. Nobody downstairs seemed to notice us, the only 2 people down there were both deep in study with their headphones on. Seems like we made it.

Rushing back upstairs we booked it for the door, but were stopped by a voice to our right.

""Your shirt is on inside out.""

We both looked over to see the girls that had been staring at Rayna as we walked in. The girl closest to us had been the one to say something, a smirk of superiority settled on her face as the other girls both covered their mouths and laughed. I looked over to see that, yes, Rayna was wearing her shirt inside out. Her face was bright red, but something else came over her face as the girls continued to laugh at her, a look of defiance.

She brightly smiled and said, ""Oh, really?"" as she looked down at her outfit.

She lifted the shirt over her head, letting her tits out in the middle of the library before turning the shirt around and putting it back on. The girls' laughing stopped dead, as faces bloomed bright red and their mouths hung open.

""Thanks for telling me!"" Rayna said with a bright smile.

Rayna grabbed my hand and we walked out the door. The moment the door shut behind us, releasing us into the cold night air we both broke down laughing. Doubled over, holding onto each other we gasped for air as hysterical laughter racked our bodies.

""Did you see their faces?"" she asked, tears brimming in the corners of her eyes.

""That was fucking crazy!"" I said, my face starting to hurt from the strain of smiling.

Arm in arm we walked back to the dorm, still laughing uncontrollably. Throughout the walk we would get it under control only for one of us to break, causing the other to fall right back into hysterics. It was the most fun I've had with anyone in a long time.

""You're definitely going to have the most impressive public video,"" I said as our laughter finally subsided.

""Oh, the other girls didn't have to do that,"" she replied.

""Wait, what?""

""Yeah, they gave us unique assignments this week to 'shape our specialties'"" she said, putting air quotes around their phrasing.

""What did the other girls have to do.""

""You know I can't tell you anything, daddy.""

""Come oooonnn, I really want to know""

""No! You're gonna tell Anna and get me in trouble again!"" she said, a mischievous smile on her face.

""It seems like that's what you want me to do.""

""Noooooo..."" she said, turning away from me.

I left it hanging as we walked into the dorm and back to her room.

When the door closed behind me I spun her around, grabbing a handful of her hair to tilt her head back, forcing her to look at me.

""Tell me about your whore pledge sister's challenges,"" I whispered in her ear.

""Daddy, I can't, mistress Anna will be mad at me,"" she whimpered back.

Sliding my hand down her body I stuck my hand under her miniskirt. My middle two fingers found her pussy, feeling its warmth and its slick juices mixing with my cum that was leaking out of her. I stroked my two fingers starting from her hole and used that wetness to lubricate her clit. Drawing light circles on the tip of the sensitive nub I leaned in and whispered

""Tell me, little girl.""

""I...can't daddy""

I felt her clit strain as she got close to an orgasm. Closing her eyes and quietly moaning, Rayna tensed her body, preparing for the release of her orgasm. Instead, as she reached the edge I pulled my fingers away. Her eyes snapped open, a look of despair on her face as she felt her orgasm slip away.

""Why...why, why?"" she whispered, her eyes begging me to push her over the edge.

As her muscles loosened, resigned to losing the orgasm I returned my fingers to her clit, drawing even lighter circles.

""If you want me to stop, you'll tell me what I want to know,"" I growled into her ear.

As her second edge came and went the look of desperation on her face intensified. Then the third, fourth, fifth, tenth, fifteenth. Tears welled up in her eyes as she desperately pleaded with me to let her cum. Twentieth, twenty fifth.

""I'll tell you, daddy! I'll tell you! Just please stop teasing me, please!""

A single tear streaked down her cheek as she finally broke. Letting go of her hair I removed my hand from her pussy and pulled out my phone. I pulled up the video of the pledges rubbing themselves on her. Her face burned bright red as she saw the video of her humiliation. Pausing at the first girl, the Latina I held the phone in front of her face.

""That's Bella, daddy. She likes to be hurt so her challenge is to go to a bdsm club and put herself on stage to be whipped by whoever wants to.""

""Anna is so mean, imagine what she's gonna do to you when she hears about this.""

Tears welled up in her eyes again as she whimpered. Continuing the video I paused again at the raven haired girl.

""That's Tana, she really likes anal, so she has to wear a weighted buttplug to class and not let it fall out of her in front of people.""

""Is she this creative with her punishments too, little girl?""

""Yes, daddy..."" she mumbled.

I advanced the video again to the thick black girl.

""That's Krista, she's really good at sucking dick so Anna is sending her to a gloryhole and making her post the address on the Betas' instagram.""

""Do you think Anna will let me take part in the punishment?""

""Daddyyyy!"" she whined.

Playing the video one more time I showed her the final girl, the skinny Wasian girl humping her foot.

""Anita is even more submissive than me, daddy. And she really likes feet, so she has to find a stranger who will let her lick their shoe.""

""Wow, how humiliating. Maybe I should make you do that too.""

""Daddy, please, no."" She whined.

""Oh, little girl,I won't...for now."" I said with a grin.

Pinning her against the wall, I set the video to loop, holding it in front of her face. I returned to rubbing her clit; putting more pressure on it I stroked from side to side, letting my fingers catch on her stiff clit with every stroke.

""Keep watching your sisters use you, little girl.""

""Yes, daddy."" She said, watching the video with her mouth hanging slightly open.

I hooked my fingers inside of her, curling them toward her stomach, pressing on her g spot with my fingertips. Her mouth opened louder in a silent scream as her pussy clenched around my fingers. As she orgasmed her legs gave out, sending her sliding down the wall. I followed her down, my fingers still inside her, as I moved to her side and pulled her into me. My arm that was holding up the phone wrapped around her neck, holding her close to me in a headlock as I continued to fuck her with my fingers the speaker of the phone playing the sound of her humiliation directly in her ear. Wetness hit my palm as she let out a geyser of squirt, soaking the carpet underneath her. After her orgasm subsided I pulled my fingers out of her, dripping with squirt, grool, and cum.

""Clean me up, slut."" I whispered in her ear.

Without a word she opened up her mouth and stuck out her tongue, leaving her weight fully on me, staring ahead with unfocused eyes. I put the fingers I made her cum with in her mouth and wiped them on her tongue, using her as a cleanup station. I rubbed my soaked palm on her outstretched tongue then lightly slapped her, leaving a spot of drool on her cheek.

Anna is gonna love hearing about this.

I slept in my room that night, giving both of us some much needed recovery time before our meeting with Anna. The next day went by pretty slowly as I waited for our meeting. I had class but my mind was again occupied by Anna. When the time came for the meeting I met up with Rayna outside the apartment. In the dim light I struggled to figure out what she was wearing as she walked down the main path from the student union. I could tell that it was a form fitting dress that hugged her curves, emphasizing her breasts and hips and stopping just below the ass. What was confusing my eye was the pattern on it. As she got closer the image came into sharp relief and I couldn't stop myself from laughing at Anna's cruelty. The dress was covered in images of anime characters making ahegao faces. This might be her cruelest dress up day yet, not only was it revealing and sexual but it was also absolutely embarrassing. She was forced to broadcast to anyone who saw her that she loves hentai enough to wear something this ugly. She must have seen my reaction on my face because she started shifting as she walked, trying to cover up parts of the dress by holding her hands in awkward positions.

""Wow...I mean, this outfit really is something."" I said, giving her a long look from head to toe.

""I know..."" She said, staring at the ground.

She has been a lot more confident the last few days but this outfit really seems to have reduced her back to her bashful self. I put a comforting hand on her lower back as we walked to the Betas' house. As we walked I noticed multiple groups of people ""discreetly"" pointing at Rayna and laughing. I would imagine this had been happening all day as she did not respond to the attention, instead keeping her eyes pointed to the ground.

We made it to the outside of the Betas' house, an unassuming one story home just outside of campus. Rayna texted Anna, telling me that the Betas don't answer knocks because lots of guys stop by and bother them because of their reputation. After a moment of waiting Anna answered the door, dressed a white lace bodysuit that hugged her petite body perfectly, and a black wavy wig that cascaded to her mid back. My mouth hung open seeing her in this state of undress. Rayna seemed desensitized to the sight of Anna's body, walking toward the house and giving my hand a hard squeeze when she felt that I was not moving with her.

""Hello mistress Anna,"" Rayna said in a reverent tone, bowing her head as she approached.

""Hello daddy's girl,"" she said, lifting Rayna's chin up with a single slender finger to look at her. ""Hi daddy,"" she said, turning her seductive gaze toward me.

An annoyed look crossed Rayna's face, seeing Anna flirting with me and seeing me become a blathering mess in response.

""Come to my room,"" Anna said, turning around revealing her toned ass.

Anna's room was in the back of the perfectly clean house. Art lined the halls and a beautiful rug covered the hardwood floor leading to her room. It was a beautiful house; you wouldn't think it was owned by college students, let alone a sorority with the reputation the Betas have. Entering her room I was hit with the sweet smell of incense. Her room was covered in tapestries and art. A queen sized bed sat in the corner, next to a desk littered with homework assignments. Across from the bed sat a vintage looking chest.

Taking a seat on the edge of her bed Anna grabbed a clipboard and a pen. She patted the bed to either side of her, indicating that we should take a seat. I sat to her left and Rayna sat to her right.

""Okay, daddy's girl, are you ready to be evaluated?"" she asked, turning to look directly in Rayna's eyes.

""Yes, mistress Anna.""

""Daddy..."" she said, turning her intense gaze toward me, ""how would you say our little pledge has been doing since joining her pledge class?""

""Oh,"" I said, taken off guard by being asked questions first, ""she's been great, it's been an amazing experience training her with you all.""

""Her attitude?""

""She's been a great submissive, she's gotten a lot more confident and enthusiastic since joining, although I don't mind the embarrassed act either."" I said, shooting a flirty glance at Rayna, whose face was turning bright red in response to being talked about like she wasn't in the room.

""And how has she been serving you? Blowjobs?""

I laughed taken off guard by how direct her question was

""She's been great, she can deepthroat me way better now than when you got our videos.""

""And the sex?"" she asked, her gaze flitting to my cock for just a moment.

""The best I've ever had,"" I said, making sure to make eye contact with Rayna.

""And has she been following the rules of pledging?""

""Well..."" I said, flashing a sadistic smile to Rayna, whose eyes widened upon hearing my tone, ""she did tell me about the other pledges and all their special challenges this week.""

I saw a cruel glint in Anna's eye as she turned her head to look at Rayna.",,2025-08-15T19:07:59.468956,3679,
https://www.literotica.com/s/my-crazy-girlfriend-honeymoon-pt-03,My Crazy Girlfriend: Honeymoon Pt. 03,Unknown Author,,,,,"Liv had sat up from her bitter pouting that Kayla had abandoned us after just a single round. She kissed me as the strap from her bra dropped off her shoulder, playing her tongue along mine, giggling as my stiff cock grazed her stomach.

""You're already hard again,"" She leaned over kissing my neck, ""Let's go find another slut for you."" She panted into my skin.

""I just fucked a total stranger; I want to fuck you now."" I panted back, running my hands across her ass.

""Come on, when's the next time we'll be in paradise with a club at the resort?"" Her pleading eyes sparkled up at me, her soft hand was stroking me, trying to massage me into agreement. I didn't relish the thought of spending our whole honeymoon engaging in my new wife's relentless depravity, but the look in her eyes told me resisting would be pointless.

""Do you really want to spend our honeymoon watching me bang skanks the whole time?"" I asked smirking.

She rolled her eyes sheepishly, ""Not the whole time, just... you know... at night... maybe sometimes at the beach."" She leaned up and put her nose to mine playfully, ""If you don't want to, you and I can see how much thick batter you can pump into me, but I just thought, once we graduate and get out into the real world it'll so much harder for me to do this with you. I just wanted one more nasty little get away.""

I sighed and touched her face, ""You're the weirdest wife.""

""That's not a no."" She giggled, her nose scrunching up.

""It's not, but when we're done,"" I reached down and put my hand between her legs, my finger rubbing the slick, mess that saturated her panties. She jolted and groaned, grabbing my neck, ""You and I are going to do some gross baby making.""

She bounced in place, ""I'm going to go get into something wing-man-y. You dress your cutest.""

She bounded off the bed and to the bags in the corner, rifling through her belongings for something to wear, pulling out a blue dress that she hastily put on over the soiled underwear she was wearing. It was cute and short, but not provocative, with spaghetti straps and white stripes.

I put on slacks and a white button up. I wanted to wear jeans but was roundly scolded until I picked something that would allow more feeling when dancing. Once dressed, and freshened up, I was dragged from the room across the resort facility to a long line that waited to get into the dance club. Liv was feeling playful and danced to the music that boomed through the wall, teasing me, grinding, and laughing until we were admitted.

Once in the club she grabbed my hand and pulled the gold wedding band off, dropping it into her purse, ""I'm getting drinks, you go play."" She winked and headed towards the bar.

Out on the dance floor I face planted almost literally. I danced with some cute girls who quickly moved on to either their friends or dates and eventually made my way back to Liv at the bar who, being the pickup artist she is, had two cute girls sitting with her.

I picked up the Jack and Coke she had ordered for me, which had now sweated a small pool of condensation onto the bar and sipped it through the straw, ""Who are your friends?"" I asked casually looking them over. Liv is incredible. ""Josie,"" introduced herself, a flat, doll sized, blonde with the world's most innocent face. Her big eyes looked out at everything like she was afraid of being eaten. She wore a cute purple dress that hugged her petite waist. ""Ava,"" was a long, evenly tanned beauty with blue eyes and long black hair. She was wearing a black, pinstripe, cocktail dress that advertised her butt and long slender legs.

I introduced myself and Ava looked me over, ""How do you know each other?""

Liv leaned in and spoke loudly over the music, ""I'm his wingman to these things, poor guy has no game."" Ava laughed and Josie smiled.

""Do you mind if I take your friend out to dance?"" Ava asked, Liv gestured to the dance floor and Ava grabbed my wrist pulling me into the crowd of people gyrating to the thumping music. Ava was not messing around, as soon as we reached a comfortable spot, she set to work rocking her hips against the seat of my pants, her butt pushed into me as she rolled her body to the music.

She was anxious to feel my hands on her, pulling them to her hips so I could feel her body move and sway. She leaned back, putting her arms around my neck as she leaned her backside into me, craning her head with a sweet smile and yelled over the music, ""Are you as into me as it feels?""

I was confused by the question until the swaying of her hips altered me to my cock throbbing against her through my slacks. I answered the question by pulling her face to mine in a soft kiss. She kissed back, but it wasn't soft. She was hungry, the dress and tan had been lures. Her tongue slithered against mine and I felt the cheeks of her butt pushing apart against me as she ground her hips up and down through the kiss.

We parted the kiss and her eyes bored into me, but looked away when she saw I wasn't looking back, Liv walked up smiling and got close to Ava, who blushed, ""Sorry for stealing your date!"" Ava yelled.

""I can share!"" Liv yelled back. Liv leaned into Ava, putting her arms over Ava's shoulders and onto mine leaning in. Ava welcomed the kiss from her new, ginger friend. They embraced in a sapphic kiss, Ava putting her hands around Liv who locked her lips and tongue with Ava's in a delicate embrace. They pulled apart slowly, their noses touching, and Ava leaned into Liv's ear. Liv gave a big smile and nodded pointing as I felt Ava's hand grab mine.

She led me from the dance floor as I looked over my shoulder at Liv who had gone back to the bar. Ava pulled me to a corner booth in the darkest part of the club and pushed me into the cushioned seat. She climbed into the seat, straddling me, the hem of her dress sliding up her fit, tan, legs as she leaned over, beginning to kiss me.

I could hear her panting and gasping as she rocked her hips into my lap as we kissed. I could feel her panties gliding against me and feel her voice through our intense kiss. She pulled back in annoyance and barked, ""Touch me.""

I put my hand on her flat stomach and slid it upward between her breasts to her neck and pulled her back into the kiss, my other hand slid down her side and back resting on her ass which was still grinding into my stiff, tented, lap. I felt the cushion shift as someone climbed into the booth but when I turned to look, Ava held my head firm to continue feeling my tongue with hers, dragging her ass against my lap and hand.

I heard Liv's voice over the music, ""Save some for the rest of us.""

Ava smiled and leaned back, looking over at my wife, ""I was about to ask him to come back to our room.""

Liv gave her a pleading look, ""Can I come?""

Ava laughed looking at me and then at Liv, ""Alright, yeah.""

Josie, who had followed Liv, clearly afraid of being left out, called to her friend over the table, ""What should I do?""

Ava shrugged, ""Come with us.""

Josie watched her dark-haired friend lean over and kiss my neck while looking at her, Liv leaned into Josie's ear and whispered encouragement. Ava looked at Liv, ""We're on the first floor.""

She looked back at me, climbing out of my lap, ""Stay close."" She winked as I stood up. We made our way through the club, Ava with a tight hold on my hand and for a moment, I marveled at the whole scenario. Less than two hours ago, a stranger named Kayla was screaming on top of me as my wife rubbed herself into a stupor. Now, because of my wife's ability to find anxious, horny, young women anywhere she went, I was now going to a stranger's room with her, and two girls.

The walk back to the girls' room was brief, and less of a walk than a hustle. It was like we had a bus to catch that could leave at any moment, but that bus was a depraved night in. Ava's hand was slick with sweat from pulling me along. We made it to the door and Josie unlocked it, Ava apparently hadn't traveled with her purse.

We had scarcely cleared the door and made it into the room when Ava grabbed my shoulders and threw me to the bed, climbing onto it and over me. She leaned her head down, on her hands and knees, her lips and tongue lashing at mine with mating fervor as her hand undid my belt and pants tugging them open. She reached into my boxers stroking my bare shaft as she kissed my neck for several moments before pulling her hand free and licking it with an evil smile, ""I'm not your first catch of the night.""

""Well, um, its uh..."" I stammered.

She laughed, ""Well, when I'm finished there won't be anymore."" She yanked on my boxers pulling my cock out and sliding down until she knelt on the floor in front of me, tugging at my pants until they came off as I kicked my feet free of my shoes, my cock bobbing as it throbbed in the open air.

She wrapped her full lips around and began bobbing, sucking Kayla's flavor off me, her tongue dragging along the bottom of my shaft as the seal of her mouth tugged. I pulled her thick, dark, hair to one side as she sucked, causing me to grunt in enjoyment. Liv crawled onto the bed and watched, her big eyes sparkling happily as the club girl worked my hard cock.

Ava's mouth slid up and she licked precum off my tip as it popped against her chin, ""I needed this so bad."" She said leaning over and dragging her tongue over me in a long swipe looking back at Josie who was sitting on the floor, awkwardly hugging her legs.

""Come get in on this,""

""Oh, I don't know. I'm not really into hook ups."" The blonde said looking away.

""I know you're jealous and feeling left out watching, now would you get over here."" Ava scolded.

Josie crawled across the floor to the edge of the bed and positioned in front of me with Ava who wagged my cock with her hand to tempt her bashful friend. Josie gave her friend a dirty look before taking me into her small hands and stroking, rubbing her thumb in precum before leaning over and sucking.

I watched the cute face slide up and down, her big eyes looking at me as though she was insecure about how much I enjoyed what was she was doing. I hoped my heavy breathing and pulsing cock against her tongue confirmed that I was lost in her soft mouth.

""So, you two are on the rebound?"" Liv asked Ava while watching the innocent girl stroke me with her lips.

""I am,"" Josie said pulling her friend's blonde hair over her shoulder, ""Josie here is just on a dry spell because she thinks no one will like her because she's flat.""

Josie stopped and looked up at her friend with an angry look, ""It's hard to get into the mood when you're insulting me.""

Liv laughed, ""Don't worry, I know his type and skinny little things are exactly it.""

Josie looked at Liv for assurance before lowering her mouth around me again. Her mouth was gentle and slow as she bobbed up and down lapping up precum from my tip as she did. I flexed my hips up, pushing into her throat which made her gag but she didn't seem to mind.

I leaned her away and took Ava's hand, standing up, ""That's enough of me,"" I pulled Ava into a kiss that she welcomed and reached under her dress slipping her panties off. She shimmied her fit body letting them drop to her ankles. I pushed her onto the bed and she laughed.

I turned to Josie and pulled her to her feet, I spun her back to me and leaned forward so my cock pressed against her, grabbing her a-cups making her gasp and her knees give. I kissed her neck feeling her squirm as I groped her for several moments as Ava and Liv watched, entertained, before reaching for her panties and sliding them off.

I pushed her onto the bed and crawled up to Ava pulling her legs open, the dress riding up to expose her wet, brown pussy. The inside was visible and wet. I pushed my tongue into the glossy mess and dragged it up along her folds and clit. She clenched, flexing her hips up and groaned, grabbing the comforter. I flicked my tongue against the slick hood of her clit, lapping at her wet lips, while my hands held her hips in place in a firm grip.

Liv leaned over, hiding Ava's face behind her copper hair and kissed her. Ava's moans were not muted through the kiss, though she made an effort to keep her lips to Liv's. I felt her thighs tighten and her stomach try to buck as I lapped at her pussy, noticing it drip onto the blanket.

Suddenly, just as I felt her start to throb close to climax there was a loud series of bangs at the door. Ava's eyes popped open and she closed her legs, ""Get in the closet!"" She hissed.

""Wait, what?"" I asked, alarmed and confused.

""Go!"" She hissed again, snatching my belt, pants, and shoes, and shoving me into the closet. Josie and Liv had already scrambled off the bed into the mirrored space and I followed. She slid the closet closed and we waited in the dark. Light was cutting in, allowing us a faint view inside the closet.

As we waited in silence, we heard a heavy voice interrogating Ava about where she had disappeared to. I didn't need to look at Liv to feel her cringe at what might be going on. I tried to listen in but was distracted at the feeling of soft flesh on my softening cock.

Josie had pulled the hem of her dress up to expose her ass and was dragging it across me. I couldn't see much of her face, but I could feel her leaning into the effort bringing my cock to a throbbing stand. I could feel my cock being pushed down against her. Liv was encouraging Josie, whose hands were at my neck.

Outside we could hear Ava arguing with what sounded like an older man, insisting nothing was going on, she had forgotten her phone and gotten back to the room late. Josie let go of my neck and leaned against the wall, pushing her hips out. I pulled back my hips and pushed my cock down, so it glided between her legs, along the lips of her pussy which were almost as wet as Liv got. I heard a quiet squeal from Josie as I slid my cock back and forth against her.

In the faint light, I could see her hand over her mouth as my shaft teased her in the dark, making her flat, pale, body twitch. I leaned in and kissed her neck sawing back and forth making her whimper and pant into her hand.

""Want it?"" I whispered as quietly as I could into her ear.

She nodded, ""Ok stay quiet.""

I pulled back feeling my tip graze along her wet cunt until I felt her opening and pushed. She squealed into her palm, pushing her face against the wall as she did. Her pussy squeezed me as I pushed in. She was so tight I gasped louder than I meant to as I slid into her until her ass hit my stomach. I started to pump, slowly at first, thrusting in and out in a steady rhythm. Josie struggled to stay silent as I started to fuck her.

I sped up hearing her cries and whimpers through her palm, fluid dripped down her leg. I was lost in the soft, tight, grip of her pussy, relishing the noises the sweet, bashful girl made as I fucked when the door of the closet slid open, and Ava stood in the opening.

""I put you in the closet for just a few minutes to shew my dad away and you're fucking my rebound on the sly."" She smirked, ""I'm so proud of you.""

I pulled free of Josie and looked at Ava, ""Your dad?"" I asked with a nervous edge.

""We're freshman at UT on a family getaway. Relax."" Ava said rolling her eyes. She looked at Josie, ""Quit hogging all the fun and get out here.""

I leaned away and stepped away from the closet, Josie and Liv following. Ava pulled the straps on her dress down and exposed her long, tan, body, with cute b's bobbing as she tugged the garment off her ankles. Her lean, teenage body was now completely naked, and she wielded it like a weapon, getting close to me, stroking my cock that was slick with her friend's pussy,

""I brought you up here to fuck you until you were empty because I'm depressed, but if you can promise that will still happen after fucking Josie, I guess she can go first.""

Liv leaned into Ava and kissed her cheek, ""It doesn't matter who goes first, he's insatiable. He could fuck us all tonight.""

Ava raised an eyebrow, ""Good."" She said flatly before pushing me onto the bed and climbing over me, ""Sorry Josie, I have to cut in.""

She straddled me, her lean, tan body hanging over as she got settled into place. She leaned over me and I took her nipple in my mouth and sucked, she moaned and laughed as she positioned my cock under her and slide down. She leaned back until her butt hit my thighs and groaned with satisfaction, starting to rock her hips.

Her body flexed on top of me as she started to fuck, her voice getting louder, her body starting to rob her of control as she bent over grabbing the comforter by my head. She was aggressive, groaning and grinding, stroking her insides with my cock.

""Fuck, it feels so good..."" She panted. She leaned over and dragged her tongue up my face. I slapped her ass and she gasped before leaning back and working her hips forcefully.

I held her hips as she fucked, groaning, her b-cups shaking as her body rolled on top of me, her dark hair invading her cute, breathless face as she fucked. The wet sounds of her thrashing pussy filled the room as Josie and Liv watched hypnotized. I reached up squeezing one of her breasts, playing with the nipple in my fingers making her eyes close.

Her young pussy was slick and tight and the steady movement of her hips built hot pressure in my hips that began to slip from my control. I put my hand on her side and the other on her shoulder and she smiled down at me, ""Gonna cum?""

""Soon,"" I panted.

She laughed wickedly and kept fucking, her hips rhythmically stroking me cock, panting and relishing my struggle to keep control as her teen body worked until without warning she lurched forward, and my cock sprang free. She leaned down letting the top push against her ass and kissed my neck.

""Not so fast, I want to play with you more first."" She said, leaning over and kissing me. I held her face, my fingers laced in her hair for several moments before pulling back.

""I'm glad to hear that because I wasn't done with my snack."" I put my hand on her shoulder and lurched, rolling her onto her back. She yelled in surprise grabbing me as I tossed her over me and began climbing down between her legs. Her pussy was puffy from the abuse she'd just put it through, and fluid smeared across her folds. I plunged my tongue against it, grabbing her hips, lapping at it, tasting the sour flavor. She cried and grabbed my hair, flexing and bucking as I ate her.

She cried, one hand holding my hair the other clutching the comforter above her as I flicked the hood of her clit and massaged the lips of her cunt. I could feel it starting to pulse as I ate, her slender brown body twitching and losing control.

Liv had crawled over to her and wrapped her mouth around one of Ava's perky breasts, sucking and licking, sending her into a frenzy as her moans fried into gasps. Her hand yanked violently on my scalp as her body thrashed, climax threatening to overtake her. I flexed my grip on her hips and waist, pinning her down as I licked and tongued until she groaned and shook.

Climax shot across her making her flat stomach tighten, her pussy dripped and pulsed against my tongue as her legs bent and toes curled from the heat and shocks my tongue sent through her body. She gasped for breath, raking hair from her face and laughed, ""Y'all are so fun.""

Liv craned over Ava with a smile, copper hair hanging in Ava's face, ""Feeling better now?""

""I'm feeling pretty good now, yeah."" Ava said with a laugh, pulling Liv into a kiss. I watched them kiss for several moments, Liv whimpering against Ava's plump lips before pulling away and whispering in her ear.

Ava giggled, ""Really?"" Liv nodded, and they both looked at me.

""What?"" I asked.

Ava rolled onto her stomach, laying flat and put her hands on her ass making her young cheeks bounce, ""Ready for a little booty?""

I crawled over, my legs spread around hers, like a pavlovian response. Precum dripped off my cock onto her ass and she bit her lip as I angled down towards her pussy as she flexed her hips up to me. I dragged my wet cock across her ass before plunging it into her again. She cried and grabbed the sheets as I pushed my way in, her tan body pushing back to feel me stretching her.",,2025-08-15T19:08:05.980244,3822,

--

""Okay, I'm done. Where is he?"" Lucy demands of me and drops a full basket of laundry on the floor of the kitchen. Working on those manners, I see.

""He?"" I ask, perking my ears as I turn from the sink.

""You know goddamn well who I mean!"" she growls. A weird turn of phrase for a demon.

""Those aren't folded,"" I point down at the pile of clean clothes haphazardly thrown into the hamper. They do appear clean at least, I suppose.

""Look. I'm a sex demon. I don't have any skills that aren't related to fucking. I don't know what you expect from me,"" she crosses her arms and pouts.

That's technically a fair point, but these are some bottom-of-the-barrel domestic tasks I'm giving her. It's not like I gave her any chores I didn't think she could handle, like cooking a meal, or not being a bitch for five minutes.

I dry my hands and walk over, picking up a shirt, ""It's not that complicated, let me show you.""

More pouting, ""He said do what you needed me to do, and you said clean them. I cleaned them. Now when do I get fed? He promised. Now I can't find him.""

""We just ate dinner an hour ago,"" I sigh and tell her, noticing that she's not paying attention to the folding.

""You know what I fucking mean, Lorelei,"" that's an improvement, she used my name.

""Given the time, he's probably up in his study,"" I continue patiently folding.

""I tried, the door's locked. And it's solid, I think he put a ward on it or something.""

""Then he's definitely in there - wait, what do you mean 'solid'?"" my ears droop a bit, ""I better not find hoof prints on that door, Lucy.""

She ignores my concern, ""What the hell is he doing in there, when I'm out here waiting for him?""

""This is quite normal. Things have been a bit out of sorts since you arrived, but you'll find that master is actually quite the introvert. It's regular for him to spend time alone like this,"" I explain.

""How do we get in there?"" she demands, tapping her hoof on my nicely cleaned floor.

""We don't. That's the purpose of a lock. We wait for him to come out when he's ready,"" I try to sound patient, and not because I know it pisses her off.

""Well don't you have a key?""

""I do,"" well, not just because I know it pisses her off.

""Can I have it?""

""You cannot.""

""What's the point of having it, then!?"" her tail whips from side to side.

""In case I need to get in there,"" I resume my folding, ""And I don't, right now. Master locked the door because he wants to be alone, and we will respect that.""

""But I need to-""

""No you don't,"" I abruptly state, ""You can wait till he comes down.""

She just crosses her arms and growls.

Believe it or not, things have been getting better between us. She still acts like somewhere between a spoiled child and an animal in heat, but since I fed her master's semen, she's softened a bit towards me. Less like an intolerable house guest, and more like an intolerable sibling. And more importantly, her attitude towards master is noticeably more submissive, I'm pleased to say.

The swishing of her tail calms and she simmers down a bit, ""So what have you been doing out of the house, Lorelei? I wonder if our master would be curious...""

I stop folding and set the clothes down, ""I'm not sure I care for what you're insinuating, Lucy.""

""I'm not insinuating. Just noting what I see. You leave the house late in the evening, when master is occupied. You dress up nicely. And sometimes you come back with a smell of cigarette smoke and alcohol on you,"" she idly inspects her nails, ""Almost like you're out dating or something.""

She's more clever than I gave her credit for. It's sort of technically right, even if she's way off base about what she thinks she's got over my head.

""So what is it, Lorelei?"" she leans over the table, not even sure if she's trying to taunt me with her impossibly perfect breasts, ""Find another man to take care of your needs? Another human? Or maybe you're a traditionalist, and you want some of your own kind?""

Okay, the elf boy implication is too far, bitch, ""It's nothing of the sort, Lucy. I think the orgasm denial is getting to you.""

""Oh, I don't blame you. Hey, if a girl can't get it at home, where can she get it, right?""

""I think you'll recall that I wear a chastity belt. What you're proposing is ridiculous,"" I narrow my eyes at her.

""Ah, so you're a backdoor girl, are you? Why doesn't that surprise me?"" the tail swishing starts again, ""But here's the thing - I thought you belonged to master, body and all. What would he think if he knew you were giving it away to some other man? Would he be okay with that? I mean, just because he hasn't felt your little holes were worth fucking doesn't change the fact that they're his, right?""

""I'm doing nothing of the sort,"" my ears fold back like a cat, ""And if your senses are as sharp as you make them out to be, your nose would tell you that nothing like that is happening.""

She shrugs in a very passive-aggressive manner, ""Maybe you shower before you come back?""

""My hair would be wet,"" I snap back.

Her expression breaks and she giggles, ""Lorelei, you know I'm just fucking with you, right?""

""Are you?"" my ears stay folded back.

""Eh, like fifty-fifty. I don't actually think you're fucking other men. But you do smell like other women sometimes, even if not sexually. I wanna know what's up. C'mon. We're basically sisters now, you can tell me.""

""And the implication that you were going to blackmail me, I'm just supposed to forget about that?""

""Ugh, all hung up on little things like that. Look, I need that fucking cock, so yeah, if I thought I could blackmail you into facilitating that, I would. But if you were fucking around, you'd deserve it, no?"" she leans back and stretches, ""But you're not, so no harm, no foul, right?""

I just hold my arms crossed and study her.

""Again. Demon from hell. Not sure exactly what you expect from me, here,"" she slouches against the wall.

I sigh and drop my arms. She's strangely hard to stay mad at.

""We want the same thing, don't we? I can see it in your eyes when you watch him. Not to mention smell how drenched you get when he gives you any attention. And you call me a slut,"" she says, not incorrectly.

""What's your point?""

""I think whatever you're up to is about pleasing him. You know, on account of you being obsessed with him like a horny teenager,"" she walks over and puts her hands on my shoulders, ""And I'm all about that. Making him happy can only mean more attention. So tell me, and maybe I can help.""

I'm only given a moment to ponder this proposal of a deal from a literal devil for a moment.

https://www.literotica.com/s/the-millers-ch-08,The Millers Ch. 08,Unknown Author,,,,,"Robby, although he was not paying much attention to me, he was getting serious about building my ""brand."" His intentions were selfish as he allowed me to quit the restaurant as long as I replaced the source of income by other means. I found a file on the laptop that he must have thought was hidden well but I was able to open it.

The file had separate tabs for all of the money he had earned off of me.

The panty file, netting him almost $600 in two months after costs.

The Old Guy parties which after costs netted him close to $6,000 in four months. Turns out the old guys are mostly very generous with their monthly dues.

Robby had mentioned that he intended to use that group of men to raise the bar and ""rent"" me out one on one for nights and maybe even weekends. Basically he was going to make me a prostitute.

He took me out one afternoon to the Lion's Den and also Lover's Lane to purchase some costumes and stripper clothes.

We ended up with cheerleader, schoolgirl, nurse, French Maid outfits as well as some stripper dresses and outfits complete with g strings. These were added to the recently purchased bdsm outfits he and Kayla were requiring me to wear around the house as their interests in keeping me almost 24/7 dressed as a slave/submissive.

Robby speculated that I could have regular ""customers"" and require between $500 and $1,000 per night with special packages for weekend two day events. I would still be available during the day to wait on them hand and foot as well as succumbing to their ever improving dom/me skills. Kayla was excelling at using the implements of pain while Robby still needed some work as he often gives up on the whips etc and used just his hands to impart pain.

I'm not sure why or how but my tolerance for pain received has increased and I actually look forward to receiving special attention and have mastered finding my ""sub space"" which helps me to take anything they can dish out and beg for more. Not sure if I am a masochist or maybe a sadist or both? I have also reached their goal of weight loss as I am now under 100 pounds. I am so turned on by what I see in the mirror that I have almost totally forgone food and basically survive on water, Kayla's bodily fluids, Robby's fluids when he's kind enough to provide them and a bowl of kibble which sits next to a water bowl and yes I feed out of the bowls like the dog that I am.

I wear my collar 24/7 now and my owners have a custom tag attached that lists Robby and Kayla as my owners. I was so happy when they presented me with the collar. They often fit me with the ball gag or the hole gag for days that Robby is actually willing to let me suck him off. Not too often any more but at least once a week I get to taste my brothers delicious sperm.

The two of them have found a new fetish on the net. . . bukkake. They stumbled upon the GGG website (German Goo Girls.) The site specializes in both extreme bukkake and brutal throat fucking, both of which I am down for.

Robby and Kayla have been discussing how to save up multiple loads of spooge. They have a Rubbermaid container in the freezer and have started saving condoms which he is using recently. He will probably have the old guys donate their jack off loads as well. He has threatened to send me up to the local ABS and volunteer to clean out their booths and video theater to gain access to even more used condoms but I am not really looking forward to the additional risk involved as all of the old guys have been tested and are good and the three of us also undergo six month screenings and so far so good. Their goal is to collect enough semen that they can conduct a full blown(pardon the pun) bukkake party documented on film and possibly sell it to one of the amateur porn studios.

I look forward to being completely covered in cum and then made to eat it like those Japanese sluts do online. Anywhere between 50 and 100 loads saved up and warmed up properly, then placed strategically all over my face, chest stomach etc. then having Kayla spoon feed it to me as I will be unable to see as my eyes will be covered in cum I'm sure. Problem is that cum, just like urine, tastes bad once cold. This of course only increases the moisture my pussy produces when I think about being used in such a way.

So daily I am still tongue bathing Kayla after her workouts and I spend a lot of time on her feet and her asshole as she really enjoys my oral skills. Although I prefer freshly flushed bladders and clear pee Robby and Kayla don't really give a fuck and force me to drink their a.m. piss almost daily, knowing that I gag and choke it down. I trick myself into drinking it by concentrating on touching myself, specifically my rib cage as I can now count my ribs individually. This gets my mind off of the nasty tasting piss that they are forcing on me.

Secretly my goal is 85 pounds but I'm sure that they will not allow me to get that small. My body is getting down to skin and bones, literally, and my boobs are so flat that I look like a boy. I keep my pussy shaved as the Grandpa's seem to like the look of their ""grand daughter"" looking young beyond her 21 years. I think that with the proper boys hair cut I can complete the look.

Robby and Kayla sat me down yesterday and discussed my first ""customer"" from the Grandpa group for some one on one attention. Turns out it's Carl, one of my favorite Grandpas just turned 70 and he is the one that likes to face time his wife while I am sucking him off. Seems that he is also cuckqueaning his wife but fact is she probably isn't interested in sex anymore and the fact she is aware of his monthly party going she is basically giving him permission to cheat without the risk of losing him to someone closer to his age. They had a pretty detailed email from Carl laying out the role play scene that he was ordering up.

I was going to spend two nights out at their summer cottage with them both as their ""grand daughter visiting from college."" His wife, Hilda, was looking forward to this weekend as she loved to please her man without having to do the work.

She would watch part of the time and would let him be part of the time. The times she left him alone was when his scenes were borderline immoral, taking his grand daughter while she slept, forcing himself on her while Granny napped.

Carl had a fresh supply of Viagra and my main hope was that I was not going to kill him by overdoing it. Mind you the old men are used to just getting head jobs from me and now the stakes were going to be higher as my other two holes were now fair game. I can't imagine Grandpa fucking me in the ass but who knows? Maybe he will be one of those ass to mouth freaks.

After the weekend Carl dropped me off at the house and I tenderly walked into the house, all three of my whore holes sore as hell. Grandpa really stuck it to his grand daughter once he finally had ""the nerve"" to visit her in the night while she slept. I know I am fucked up but I kinda liked the attention and Hilda was happy with the result so she had a happy man for another week or month. Either her or Carl stuck a few extra Franklin's in my suitcase. . . must be a tip for excellent service.

Kayla was out on her run but Robby made me update him on the results of my first experience as a prostitute. Although he was not normally jealous of the old guys he seemed a bit miffed at me. Maybe because I may have sounded as though I had fun or enjoyed myself. I have to say that I did have a dozen or more orgasms. Did you ever have your pussy eaten by a seventy year old man who had his dentures soaking in the cleaner so he had to gum you til you screamed? You should try it at least once in your life.

Well Robby made sure I knew who was still in charge. He had me strip and stand naked in front of him, feet apart, as he gave me several full kicks directly to the pussy. Damn that fucker really knows how to impose pain. He didn't stop there though.

Next stop he tossed me back onto the couch and made me pull my legs back behind my head. He pulled up a chair for what I figured was to get a closer look at his handiwork on my swollen pussy lips, red, almost bleeding. My tender pussy was front and center waiting to be punished further. He wasted no time shoving his foot into my pussy, spreading it as he jammed his foot as far in as he could. When he saw that this was not causing me enough pain or humiliation he pulled his foot out and went in full throttle with his fingers, adding one at at time until all five were inside of me but that was not good enough. . . he began to fist me until tears were streaming down my face. He is not a fan of the tears and he made that quite clear again by taking his fist out of my pussy and spinning me over and fist fucking my sore ass. By the time he was finished I was close to passing out.

""That's what you get for enjoying yourself you common fucking prostitute!"" he yelled at me. Away he went and he didn't so much as even look at me the rest of the week.

So I spend the weekend fucking a man 50 years older than me and Robby walks away with 2 grand for my trouble and I was fortunate enough to get 300 bucks as long as I can keep it hidden. After Kayla returned and I cleaned her up and met her other needs I was able to finally pass out and dreamed about my weekend and relived the Grandpa abuse as well as fantasizing about how I could be even further depraved.

I bet a shrink would have a field day with me.",,2025-08-15T19:08:21.181202,1845,

Synopsis: Mia asks her boyfriend to fuck her bitchy boss to have leverage and realized she liked it.

*************************************************************************************************************

Mia looked at the time for the third time in thirty minutes.

""Just three-forty? I'm so boooored.""

""Go for a walk around the office. Ask if anyone needs anything,"" said her friend Emily.

""I'm not that bored.""

Mia was beginning to doubt her career choice. She worked in human resources for an insurance company. She was either bored out of her mind, or overwhelmed with work, with barely any in-between. It was all the more frustrating because she knew that tomorrow, Madison, her boss, would announce her idea for the Halloween party. As if a week was enough to prepare for the kind of party she wanted. The only real work they did was interviews and processing expenses.

Anytime Mia tried to come up with an initiative, Madison shut her down.

When Emily asked if there was anything they could do to prepare for Halloween, Madison simply said, ""You'll know next week.""

""

Bitch, we're on the same team. Why are you telling us at the same time as everyone?

"" thought Mia.

And so tomorrow, the hectic organization of the Halloween party would start. It was nothing new. Mia had worked there for a year and a half, and Madison always announced things last minute. The worst had been the Christmas party. They had to make gifts for everyone, and they also flew in employees from their offices in other countries. The only thing Madison did was book the venue. Everything else, she delegated to both of them.

Of course, when people complimented her about how good it looked, she took all the credit. Even for things she didn't even think about.

Worst of all, they couldn't complain to anyone, because the big boss, Madison's boss, was her father. They sent him an email explaining the situation in the most polite way possible, but nothing came of it. At least Mia was working with her best friend, which made the days more bearable.

She wanted to text her boyfriend, who was working from home, but restrained herself. He already warned her a couple of times that because he was working from home, didn't mean he wasn't working. She could text him here and there, but nothing like the time she basically had a conversation with him all day. Which she would have loved to do today.

""What are you doing tonight?"" inquired her friend.

""Same old. Spending the night in with Mike. You?""

""Dunno yet. Probably binge-watch something.""

They talked until it was the end of the day.

When she got home, Mike was already preparing dinner. She hugged him from behind, resting her head against his upper back with a sigh.

""Big day?"" he asked.

""No. Boring day."" She reached around and unbuckled his belt. ""I need some excitement.""

Mike chuckled and rubbed his ass on her stomach. ""Always happy to provide.""

""Hmm,"" she kissed his back. ""Don't I know it.""

Mike kept cutting the carrots as Mia tugged on his hardening cock once his pants were around his ankles. Her other hand went between his legs to play with his balls. ""How was your day?""

""Stressing. We had a bug in production. We couldn't reproduce it on our side, and the logs weren't helpful. So I added a bunch of logs everywhere, and we redeployed. Turn's out, their firewall prevented communication between our services in their ecosystem. It was a bitch to figure out.""

But he did figure it out. Mia liked how he always figured things out. She didn't know enough to comprehend how truly impressive it was, but she'd yet to hear him talk about a problem he couldn't solve.

They met four years ago during a badminton match. Mike went with a colleague on a weekly basis. Mia just moved into town and joined the local Facebook group to know when and where to play badminton. She went alone and got paired with someone to play against Mike and his friend. It began friendly, but quickly got competitive. After an hour or so of bantering, Mia challenged Mike to a one-on-one. When Mike won, Mia told him he had won her phone number.

They eventually met for a drink and had a good vibe. Four months later, they were living together.

""I wanted to text you today. Good thing I didn't."" She began to stroke him more vigorously. ""How about we start the night by taking a load off?""

Mike smiled at her wordplay and gave her a tissue. After some time, while he was peeling potatoes, he felt his orgasm coming. He turned around, and she immediately kneeled and took him into her mouth. She aggressively bobbed on his head while she stroked the shaft.

""Cumming!""

She pulled him out and moved the tissue in front of his dick, and spurts of cum landed on it. She didn't like to swallow on an empty stomach. When his orgasm subsided, she cleaned him with the tissue and kissed the tip, before lifting his pants back up.

""Thanks,"" she said, throwing the tissue in the garbage.

He didn't say anything. After four years, he was accustomed to Mia's kinks. At first, he felt bad because she always did this to him and didn't want him to reciprocate. It took a while before he was convinced she simply liked to do that. It would have been concerning if it was like that in the bedroom, too, because he also enjoyed getting her off. Fortunately, she liked to receive and give in that context. Giving handjobs here and there was just Mia being Mia.

The next day, as predicted, there was a ton of work to do for the Halloween party. Mia and Emily each went their way to decorate the office. After a few hours of being micromanaged by Madison, they sat down in the cafeteria to eat.

""What does it matter if the ghost is on the right or left of the pumpkin? What's her problem!?""

""Maybe she's overcompensating,"" said Emily, smirking.

""What do you mean?"" Mia knew something juicy was coming.

""I got in touch with one of her exes last night.""

""What!? How?""

Emily shrugged. ""Made a fake account, and she accepted my friend request. Looked through her old pictures, and contacted the guys that were tagged. I figured one of them would be all too happy to spill the beans. And boy, did he spill.""

Mia got closer. ""Well, c'mon, you know I love beans!""

""Supposedly, she's a huge submissive in bed. The kind that will do anything he wants.""

""Not surprised. How else can she get a guy to stick around? I bet she'd berate him for putting the milk in front of the orange juice. Only way to shut her up is by shoving his cock in her mouth.""

""Or replacing the broomstick in her ass,"" snickered Emily.

""Did you find anything we can hold over her?""

""Sadly, no. They never took pictures or recordings. I think she knows it will inevitably be used against her.""

""Do you know someone who could do it?""

""No, not really."" Neither of them had guy friends. ""The only guy I know is Mike."" Emily glanced over to see the reaction of Mia when she jokingly mentioned her boyfriend. Seeing her serious thinking face, she arched an eyebrow. ""You're seriously considering it?""

Mia shrugged. ""Maybe.""

The more she thought about it, the more she wanted to do it. She could hide in the closet to film them while Mike makes her his bitch. She tried to push away the idea, as she hated getting horny at work, but always came back to it. It was getting to the point where she was ready to talk about it with Mike that night.

She was a bit worried. This was a big step in their relationship. Any relationship, really. Asking him to fuck another girl could easily mess up what they have. And Mia absolutely loved what they had. She would have to broach the subject methodically.

Later, during dinner, she decided to make the first move. ""Madison acted like a bitch all day. Switch this. Lower that. Move that over here. So fucking annoying.""

Mike shook his head. ""I don't know why she acts like that. Maybe her father is hard on her, so she tries to make everything perfect to please him. I wouldn't be surprised if she has daddy issues.""

""Emily had a different theory, but in retrospect, they kind of intersect. She said she's overcompensating because she's a huge submissive in bed.""

""Yeah, sure, it could be that.""

""You don't understand. We know for a fact she's a sub.""

""How?""

""Emily got in contact with an ex of hers.""

""Ah. I wouldn't put too much weight into what an ex has to say.""

""I don't think he had any reason to lie. It's not like we can use that against her.""

""I guess.""

""And if it's true and we find a way to record it, then, we can use that against her.""

""That's a big if. How would you even go about doing that.""

""Well, we just need to find a guy to seduce her.""

""You make it sound easy.""

She decided to be direct. ""Would you do it?""

Mike choked on his food. ""What?""

""Have sex with her while I record from the closet.""

""Eeeeh...""

""We already know she has a thing for you. Remember the Christmas party? I don't think it would take much convincing.""

Mia looked down at her plate and ate, waiting for his response. Mike looked at her, pensively. ""You're serious, aren't you?""

""Yes.""

""And you would be okay watching me making love with the girl you hate?""

""Hmm, not love, sex. I want you to dominate the little bitch and fuck her hard. Think you can do that?""

Mike was hesitant. Mia wasn't the kind to play games just to test his reaction. Still, it was rarely a good idea to admit to his girlfriend that he was okay with fucking another girl. ""I think so... if it's what you want.""

""Good.""

While Mia cleaned the table, Mike processed the conversation they had just had. He knew Mia was kinky, but this was unexpected. To record him having hate sex with her office rival, she must have really wanted to hold something over her head. Maybe there was a thrill in it for her, too. She never showed a sadistic side before, except that she could be forceful at times, which he liked about her.

Later, while watching television, Mike paused the movie. ""I have to ask. Do you have a plan? Or at least the beginning of a plan?""

""Sure, I do. We go to the Halloween party in separate cars. She'll come on to you. You flirt with her. You say you'll go for a walk and bring her home, taking your time. I drive fast to get home first. I hide in the closet and film you fucking her brains out. You drive back slowly to the office, while I drive fast. Badabim, badaboom.""

""Huh, you did put some thought into it. How long have you been thinking about it?""

""Since noon.""

""What if she doesn't bite?""

Mia shrugged. ""Then she doesn't bite.""

""What if I can't go through with it.""

""Then you don't go through with it. The worst that can happen is nothing happens.""

""Mkay, I think we should both sleep on it and see if we're still up for it tomorrow. I don't want us to have any regrets about this.""

The next day, after discussing it over breakfast, they were both still on board. Although Mike couldn't make any promises, he'd try his best to make it happen. The days leading to the Halloween party moved in slow motion for Mia. Mike noticed an increased sex drive. Not that he was complaining.

On the night of the fatal day, they each drove to Mia's office in their own car. Mia was disguised as Little Red Riding Hood, while Mike was the Woodsman. They had to arrive early to set up the party. When they entered the cafeteria, they spotted Emily, sitting alone, dressed as Hermione Granger from Harry Potter.

Emily waved at them when they saw the couple. ""Hey! If it's not my favorite M&Ms.""

""Hey Emily, how are you doing?""

The couple sat next to her.

""Just fine, thank you. What do you think?""

Mike looked around. ""Pretty good! Almost as if you were paid to do this.""

""Ha, ha. We put a lot of effort into this.""

""I bet. The fog is really cool.""

""Tell me about it. We must have called dozens of places. Did you know that fog machines are especially popular during Halloween? And that calling two days prior will make the other guy on the line laugh?""

""Damn, who knew?""

""Not Madison, that's for sure. Speaking of the witch, disguised as a kitten to seduce the fools, here she comes.""

She was wearing a tight, black linen suit with black lines as whiskers. Simple enough, but leaving little to the imagination.

""Hey Mad, this is Mike, my boyfriend. You probably remember him from the Christmas party.""

""Of course."" She shook his hand. ""Girls, the party will start soon. I need you to take the plates out of the fridge.""

When the girls went away, Madison turned to Mike. ""I always had a thing for lumberjacks.""

Mike laughed. ""I picked the right costume, then. I'm a cat person myself.""

""Mreow,"" playfully said Madison, clawing at him.

He smiled and chuckled at her act, and glanced toward Mia to make her think he was nervous. The goal was to show interest, but let her work for it. She needed to think she convinced him to have sex with her. Mike had to walk the fine line between showing interest and being reluctant to cheat on Mia.

She walked away, swaying her ass, as the girls came back.

""So?"" inquired Mia, as soon as Madison was out of earshot.

""It's hooked. A bit too soon to tell if it can be reeled in.""

""Good!""

""What are you guys talking about?"" asked Emily.

""Just a prank we're pulling on Madison to see how far she'll go with Mike.""

""What if she wants to go all the way?""

""We won't let it come to that."" Mia wasn't ready to reveal her plan to her friend.

During the next couple of hours, people filtered in. The trio exchanged politeness with the ones who were making rounds. Madison used various excuses to get the girls away from Mike so she could flirt with him. It was increasingly becoming less and less subtle. Madison openly said what she would do to him if he were her boyfriend. Mike couldn't help but be aroused. He told the girls everything when they returned, shocking them each time. Mia kept giving him advice on what he should say and how to act to the incredulity of Emily. If Mike was her boyfriend, the last thing she'd want is to throw other girls into his arms. But Mia seemed to enjoy it instead.

With the help of Mia, Mike asserted his dominance over Madison through their flirting. She had Mike say things he would never have said before, thinking many times Madison would blow her lid off. But somehow, she only seemed happily surprised by how forthcoming he was.

Later in the night, Mia made him say, ""If my girlfriend weren't here, I would take you into the bathroom and have my way with you,"" to help convince her to leave the party for an hour.

Just as Mia anticipated, Madison eventually asked Mike if he could find a reason to leave the party for a while. Mike proposed they go to his house, which was just ten minutes from there. Madison readily agreed. She waited not far from the trio for Mike to make his exit.

""I'm feeling a bit stuffy. I'll go out to take some air and come back later.""

""Yeah, I know what you mean,"" said Emily. ""Unfortunately, we have to stay here, being the organizers and all.""

Mike kissed Mia and left. When she saw the door closed, Madison told the girls they were in charge for the next hour or so. When she left, Madison hoped they thought it would be suspicious of her leaving just after Mike.

""There's something I need to do. Back in an hour."" Mia felt bad for leaving Emily alone, but the party was going well, and there was little left to do until cleaning up at the end. She drove reasonably fast, not wanting to get a speeding ticket. It would ruin the whole thing. She trusted Mike to drive slower or make a detour.

When she arrived, she hid in the mirrored closet, leaving a small opening in the sliding door. She sat on a blanket, in the darkness, her phone at the ready. They had already tested if they could see her in the closet, and it was fairly safe. Madison would need to be really close to suspect anything. Before long, Mike and Madison entered the room, kissing. Mia noticed he already had his dick out. They quickly undressed, and Mike made Madison kneel.

""Finish what you started in the car, slut.""

Although he gave her an order, Mike didn't give her time to do anything. He gripped her curled brown hair and impaled her on his cock to the hilt. Mia gasped silently, impressed by Madison taking his member whole without gagging. While she could do it too, it took some effort, unlike Madison. Mia immediately felt her loins on fire at the sight. She had to control her respiration to make sure they wouldn't hear her shallow breathing.

""

Yes! Make her choke on that cock.

""

While Mike was facefucking Madison, Mia studied her. She was pretty enough, but the thing that stood out the most was her breasts. A flawless 34DD cup, perfectly symmetrical. Her stiff nipples perked out, begging to be teased. Mia couldn't help but touch her own. They were smaller, but she knew it didn't really matter that much to men, in general. At least, not to Mike.

Besides her plumper ass, they had a similar figure and height. Mike yanked her head off with a grunt. He pulled her up by the neck with two hands and pushed her onto the bed on her stomach. She yelped and giggled when he pulled her by the ankle to make her kneel on the ground while her upper body rested on the bed.

Mia zoomed on her round, tanned ass just in time to have a good shot of a slap.

""Ah!""

After slapping the other cheek, he spread them apart for the camera. Mia could tell how aroused Madison was. He positioned himself behind her and penetrated her folds, balls deep, not giving her time to adjust. There was something freeing about not caring for your partner. Mia had been clear on how to treat her. He began to fuck her hard, slamming her into the bed.

Madison gasped, but didn't tell him to slow down. She seemed to just get more excited by his behavior.

""Your cock feels so good!""

He slapped her ass. ""And your pussy is amazing!""

""Yeah? Ugh, better than-- hmpf, your girlfriend?""

Mike looked back and saw a finger pointing toward them and then up. ""

Really?

"" He wasn't sure where this was going, but this was Mia's plan. ""

All right, then.

""

He augmented his pace. ""So much better.""

He looked back again and saw a thumbs-up. Then, the thumb moved up, telling him to crank it up. Mike sighed internally, not knowing what to think of this, but complied.

""Can't compare her slack hole with your tight cunt. Fuck! I can't get enough of it.""

""Fuck, I love your cock. Fuck that tight pussy like you own it.""

Mia wanted Madison to think she was a lot better than her. The higher she thought she was above her, the higher the fall when she realized she'd been played. She trusted Mike implicitly and wasn't worried about losing him.

""

Enjoy it while you can, slut.

""

Mia wished she didn't need to film. She was horny as fuck, but didn't want the phone to shake. Should have gotten a stand. Hindsight is twenty-twenty.

""Yes! FUCK ME!""

He slowed down and leaned over her. He reached around, holding her tits, then pulled her back up in his embrace. He bit her shoulder, squeezed her breasts, and resumed his fucking with an animalistic grunt.

""Shit! Ungh, are you fucking her like that every day? Lucky little bitch.""

""

That's right, cunt. I get that whenever I want.

""

Mia was already thinking about having another hidden camera from a different angle. She wanted to see him maltreat her voluptuous assets. For now, she could only watch his ass flex every time he bumped into her. Mike pushed her back onto the bed and put his hands on her shoulder. Using that as leverage, he hammered into her.

With his weight on him, Madison couldn't stop him even if she wanted. Every thrust sent a wave of increasing pleasure in her loins. Just taking what he wanted, satisfying his carnal lust for her. Before long, her orgasm was near.",,2025-08-15T19:08:27.821262,3612,

Mated to the Pack, Ch 16

Road Trip, Wisconsin - A Sweet Surprise

Patty watched as Quinn finished me off, and even after he climaxed, he was still hard when he pulled out of me. Patty's eyes popped a little when she saw the full extent of his cock.

""Damn, you weren't kidding about him having junk in the trunk.""

Quinn said, ""Good to see you again, Patty. I'd have more to see if you took off your clothes. Don't stand on ceremony. Dani, clean up this mess.""

""Yes, Master.""

As Patty started to strip, Dani cleaned off Quinn's cock, then my pussy, which was frothy with cum. Patty looked every bit as good naked as I remembered from the locker room.

When I wasn't dripping anymore, I said, ""Patty, you remember Gretchen from school?""

""Yeah, hey Gretch. I thought you were a lezzie. How did you get pregnant?""

""Getting paid, like Jessica. I decided I could stay a gold star lesbian, or make money. I chose money.""

""You sort of met my Master, Quinn Whelan, and fellow submissive, Dani Ferguson, at the store. Did you ever meet my parents?""

""Never to talk to, no.""

""This is my mother and father, Anita and Simon Huppert. My parents are seeing what it's like being submissive like I am, so Mom is currently under submission to Quinn, and Dad to Brigitte O' Reilly. It's only temporary, during my stay in town. Dad isn't really submissive, but he wanted to see what I go through. Brigitte is my friend and bodyguard, also pregnant. Then we have Simone Bonifay, another surrogate, with her two bodyguard companions, Nathaniel and Daphne, who are married, but in an open relationship, and Randa Briggs, a fellow surrogate mother. This is the local Wisconsin man, Gerhard, who is paying money to local women to be surrogates. He's the one paying Gretchen. This woman, Janet, is Gerhard's submissive, who just accepted his collar, and this beautiful girl is Dawn."" I pointed to the wolf. ""Everyone, this is Patricia Fremont, a high school friend.""

""That doesn't look like a dog. That looks like a wolf,"" Patty said.

""A hybrid wolf,"" I admitted. ""Very intelligent and obedient. Why don't you give her some commands?""

Patty gave her several orders, sit, roll over, beg; all of which Dawn had no difficulty doing.

""That's pretty good.""

""Give her something really hard. Do you drink beer or soft drinks with your pizza?""

""Beer is fine.""

""Dawn, bring Patty a beer.""

Dawn trotted into the kitchen and came back a few seconds later with a beer in her mouth. She walked up to Patty and extended the beer to her hand.

""That is fucking amazing,"" Patty said, taking the beer.

""You should pet her for being such a good girl and bringing you a beer.""

Patty cautiously put her hand down and petted Dawn's head. ""Good girl. Thanks for the beer."" Dawn whined and rubbed against Patty's hand.

""She likes you. Dawn is Gerhard's. He raises and trains wolves. They make excellent guard animals. Do you still run?""

""Every day.""

""Do you ever get hassled on a run?""

""Sometimes.""

""Imagine running with a wolf. No one would hassle you. Dawn, protect Patty. Quinn grab a knife and pretend to threaten her.

Quinn got a serving knife off the table for cutting pizzas, and crouched down in a threatening manner, approaching Patty with the knife extended. Dawn crouched down facing Quinn and started growling, the hair on her back up, tail out. Quinn set down the knife and sat down and Dawn immediately sat down and made a soft woof.

""Brigitte, do the same thing.""

Brigitte picked up the knife and all of the behaviors got repeated, until Brigitte put down the knife.

""That's the smartest fucking dog I ever met,"" Patty said.

""You have no idea. But, like you first said, a wolf. She probably doesn't appreciate being called a dog. Good girl, Dawn. You're a wonderful wolf.""

Dawn stood up and wagged her tail. ""Pet her again, Patty. Show her you appreciate how she protected you.""

Patty started rubbing Dawn. ""You're such a good girl, Dawn. Thank you for protecting me.""

Dawn whined. Quinn said, ""Dawn says you give good head.""

Patty started laughing. ""You've got to be kidding me.""

""No, that's what she said. You give good head.""

""You speak wolf?""

""Fluently,"" Quinn said. ""That's what they used to call men who chased after women and seduced them. Nowadays, I'd be called a Player, or Pussy Hound. I feel more like a wolf. Whelan is the English pronunciation of the Irish word for wolf.""

""Yeah, the wolf symbol on your card. Cute.""

""Why don't we eat the pizza while it's hot,"" Quinn said, ""then you and I can go upstairs and party. If you still want more dick when I'm done, I'm sure Nat or Gerhard would be happy to share theirs. We all like pussy.""

""You talked me into it.""

We all ate pizza. I got Dawn some raw hamburger and put it down on the floor next to Patty. Dawn stayed with her as Patty ate. Occasionally, Patty would stick her hand down and pet her protector. Not afraid of wolves, even if she still might have a problem with dogs.

Quinn sat next to Patty, talking to her, getting to know her better. His cock remained hard, and she kept noticing, glancing down frequently at the spear between his legs.

It was close to the end of the meal and Quinn said, ""You have an amazing body, Patty. You're a beautiful woman, but can I ask you a question?""

""Sure.""

""Why Patty? You're an African queen. You shouldn't go by Patty anymore. The diminutive doesn't suit you. You should go by Patricia, or even Pat. Patty is a girl's name. Patricia is a woman's name. Hell, 'Your Highness' fits you better than Patty does.""

It was possible for a black woman to blush. I could see it. Not only that, her nipples became hard nubbins. I could see the internal preening as she absorbed his words. Wolf, seducer of women, fit him very well. I couldn't smell her arousal, but every wolf could. Hell, it was so strong, I might even be able to smell it if it weren't for the pizza.

""You can call me Your Highness if you want to,"" Patty said.

""Then, your Highness, I think it's time we adjourn to one of the bedrooms so I can worship you.""

Quinn took her hand, and pulled her to her feet, then picked her up and carried her upstairs, Dawn trotting along behind them. Her highness was a screamer of the first order. Everyone knew what was happening at any given moment.

""Lick me, right there. Just like that."" ""Oh, fuck, you're good."" ""Stick your cock in me."" ""Your cock is so good."" ""You fill me up."" ""Fuck me harder."" ""Fuck me faster."" ""Fuck, fuck, fuck, I'm cumming."" That last one got repeated a lot.

The rest of us picked up the kitchen, then Janet received her punishment before getting fucked by Gerhard. Shortly after that, Gretchen left for her house, taking Ingrid and I with, leaving the others to the debauchery soon to follow.

******

Gretchen and I talked to her parents, James and Sue, for an hour or so before we went to bed. There were a lot of questions about my pregnancy. They asked about Brigitte, who'd they'd met before, even having sex with her.

""Well, Brigitte is pregnant too.""

""I thought she was infertile?""

Blabbermouth. That's why lies were so tricky. Sometimes a lie comes back to bite you on the ass. ""Turns out she wasn't. James knocked her up that night she spent with you. Must have been Conor who was infertile.""

Their jaws dropped open like they were unhinged.

""Jessica is teasing,"" Gretchen said. ""She's only three and a half months along. If Dad knocked her up, she'd be as pregnant as I am.""

""God, you scared me half to death,"" James said. ""We're not ready for the financial responsibility of another child.""

""You don't have to worry about that,"" I said, laughing. ""Brigitte wouldn't ask for financial help. She's giving up the child. A baby would interfere with her job as a bodyguard. In fact, my parents are taking it.""

""Aren't they a little old for another baby?"" Sue asked

""Yeah, they feel a little responsible. It was my Dad who knocked her up, when my parents and Gretchen came to Maine to visit me. You weren't the only Rhinelanders getting a little on the side.""

""Your parents slept with Brigitte too?"" Sue asked.

""And Conor, and a few others. Turns out my parents are quite kinky. Who knew older couples enjoyed sex so much."" They both blushed. ""I hated even imagining my parents having sex, but now I've seen them.""

""When you say your parents had sex with Conor, does that mean...?""

""No, Dad's never had sex with Conor."" (He has a few others as of this week, but not Conor.) ""They just shared my mom. You know, one in front, one behind.""

""Oh, my,"" Sue said. She seemed flushed and started fanning herself.

""I can set something up for you and James if you want,"" I said.

""That won't be necessary, will it, James?"" Sue said.

""Let me think about that a bit.""

""Dad!"" ""James!"" Both came out at the same time.

""Hey, we enjoyed Brigitte, didn't we,"" James said. ""Think about it. You haven't been with another man since we got married. Wouldn't you like to see what it's like? I need to figure out if I could watch you with another man, but it does have some appeal. I liked watching you with Brigitte. This is a little different, but not much.""

""You're a pimp,"" Gretchen said to me.

""I guess I am.""

Leaving that up in the air and them deep in conversation, we went to Gretchen's room, where Ingrid was waiting. There ensued a lot of pussy licking, tribbing, even a strap-on or two. We were pretty sated, and resting comfortably in each other's arms.

""What's it like being spanked?"" Gretchen asked. ""I couldn't believe you orgasmed while Quinn was spanking you.""

""It ties into my submission. I'm not sure everyone would climax, but I frequently do.""

""Does it hurt?""

""Some. Not as much as you think. Orgasms, sex, the anticipation of sex, the promise of sex to follow, my arousal in being his submissive slut; they all help reduce the pain and increase the pleasure.""

""What do you mean?""

""Ingrid, you ready to lick her again?"" I asked.

""Born ready.""

""I'm now your Dominant. You can't have an orgasm without permission. You have to ask for permission, and receive it. Your orgasms now belong to me. You can't touch yourself, masturbate, use dildos, vibrators or anything, without asking me for permission. No sex of any kind, with anyone. You're my bitch now. Ingrid is going to start licking you. When you get close to an orgasm, you have to ask for my permission to cum. I may give it, I may not. You don't know. If you cum, without my permission, I'm going to spank your bare ass twenty times. It will be hard, it will hurt. You know this. You know I'm going to spank you if you cum without my permission, so you're going to resist cumming as much as you can. You'll do multiplication tables in your head, think about anything else you can, to keep from cumming. Are you ready?""

""I think so.""

""Ingrid, start licking this slut.""

Ingrid laughed. ""Yes, ma'am.""

Ingrid pulled Gretchen's legs apart and started licking. I held her hands loosely in mine and started kissing her and licking her breasts. It wasn't long before Ingrid had her squirming.

""I need to cum. Please let me cum.""

""Ask me properly. I'm your Mistress.""

""Please, Mistress. Please let me cum.""

""No, if you cum, I'm going to spank your bare ass twenty times. Don't you dare cum, slut.""

Gretchen moaned and tried to close her legs. She wasn't strong enough. Ingrid kept her legs apart and kept lapping.

""Oh, fuck! Mistress, you must let me cum. Please.""

""No."" I renewed my assault on her puckered nipples, sucking and nipping them with my teeth.

""Oh, God,"" Gretchen moaned.

""I am your God,"" I said. ""You must obey me.""

""I don't think I can help myself; I'm going to cum, Mistress.""

""You'll be spanked if you do.""

Gretchen strained to the nth degree, not to cum. Her muscles were tight, her pregnant belly quivering, her legs shaking. Suddenly she started bucking on the bed.

""Fuck, I'm cumming,"" she screamed.

Gretchen started squirting. Ingrid covered her pussy with her mouth to absorb it all, swallowing rapidly, although Gretchen was thrashing so much, it was hard for her to stay anchored on her cunt. Her convulsions seemed to go on for over a minute, before she suddenly collapsed on the bed, exhausted. Ingrid cleaned up a little more, and every few seconds, Gretchen would have another brief spate of tremors.

""Okay, that's like the orgasms I have. It's called edging. Keeping you aroused as long as possible without allowing you cum, until finally, you have no choice. Right now, you feel incredibly good, and you're sated with sex. Now I'm going to punish you. Stand up, bend over and put your hands on the bed and brace yourself for your spanking.""

Gretchen did as I asked. ""Each time I smack you, I want you to say, 'Thank you, Mistress, may I please have another.' If you don't say it, that one won't count, and I'll add another. Are we clear?""

""Yes,""

""Yes, 'Mistress'. That's one more for not addressing me properly. Say it again. Are we clear?""

""Yes, Mistress.""

""Better.""

I'd been spanked often enough, I figured I could do a proper job of it, but I held back too much on the first one. Her skin didn't pink up at all.

""Thank you, Mistress. May I please have another.""

I hit her harder this time. At least she flinched.

""Thank you, Mistress. May I please have another.""

Even harder. I saw my handprint on her ass, so I figured it was hard enough. Her ass would turn red.

""Thank you, Mistress. May I please have another.""

I remembered to move my hand around, not concentrating too much on any one spot. Twenty-one is not that many, so I knew she'd be okay. I did turn her ass a pretty shade of dark pink. I couldn't call it red. She dutifully thanked me, and even squealed a few times when I got a good one in on the same spot I'd hit before. I finished up, then shoved two fingers up her twat, and she went off again, cumming hard.

""You forgot to ask for permission to cum,"" I said. ""Twenty more.""

""No fair. I didn't know you were going to do that. I didn't even have time to ask.""

""No fair, Mistress, I didn't have time to ask. You must really want me to spank your ass,"" I laughed. ""We're done now. That's pretty much what it's like, except I get spanked more and harder, and I might even cum before fingers get shoved up my cunt. Even you have to admit you had a short fuse.""

Gretchen stood up and hugged me. ""It wasn't too bad. Maybe I see a little of the appeal, but now I need a hug.""

""Aftercare. Punishment should always come with aftercare. Hugs are good."" I pulled her down on the bed and hugged her. I stroked her hair.

""You were such a good girl. You took your spanking very well. I'm proud of you.""

Gretchen nestled deeper in my arms. ""I am a good girl. Would my Mistress like me to lick her some more.""

""Oh, definitely. Three more orgasms, slut, and do a good job this time.""

Gretchen laughed. ""Yes, Mistress. Your wish is my command.""

She wiggled down my body, kissing me all the way, and gave me four, before I pulled her back up into my arms. I smelled myself on her face, and licked my juices from around her mouth. Ingrid snuggling on the other side, we went to sleep.

******

Eating breakfast the next morning, Sue and James joined us. They looked tired, as if they'd been up half the night. With Gretchen's bed in the basement, and theirs upstairs. We might not have heard them having wild monkey sex all night.

""Did you scream last night, Gretchen?"" Sue asked. ""Something about you cumming?""

""Yes, I did. Jessica was showing me what her submission was like. She wouldn't let me orgasm under threat of a bare ass spanking, and when I finally climaxed, I squirted on Ingrid. It was pretty special, and then I got my spanking, and that wasn't bad either. Then I was a good girl and licked my Mistress to four more orgasms, so she wouldn't punish me again. I could kind of see the appeal by the time we went to sleep after that monster orgasm. Not sure I could do it, but I get why Jessica does.""

""Sue and I talked about what you suggested, Jessica. How hard would that be to arrange?"" James asked.

""So, Sue wants to feel two cocks inside of her at once,"" I laughed. ""How about three?""

""Jessica, I'm not going to let you talk to my parents anymore. You're a bad influence,"" Gretchen said.

""I know. I got you knocked up when you said you'd never take a dick.""

""Three cocks?"" Sue asked.

""One for your mouth, your pussy and your ass,"" I said. ""If you're going in for a penny, might as well shoot for a pound.""

""Oh, my.""

""Have you ever had anal sex before?""

They both looked at Gretchen.

""Don't look at me, I don't know the answer to that question. I'm not a child anymore. You can answer. I won't die. I had a screaming orgasm last night before I was spanked, for heavens sake.""

""We tried it once,"" James said. ""We were both kind of drunk, so thought we'd try it. Sue said it was painful.""

""Going about it all wrong,"" I said. ""First, you should prepare ahead of time. Wear some anal plugs for a few days to get stretched out ahead of time, remove some of the fear of having something in your butt. Next, don't do it when you're drunk. You tend to be rushed and careless when you've been drinking. Go slow and careful. Let Sue get used to something inside of her before the sex starts. You might want to consider Sue getting on top, cowgirl, except in her butt instead of her pussy. That way, she controls the depth and speed. She'll go at a pace that's comfortable for her. You should do it again before having someone else do it. The men who would join you, all have rather large cocks, so you don't want to start with them. You should go pick out a couple plugs from a sex toy shop, some lubricant. Put a smaller one inside of you first, then a larger size when you've gotten used to the first one. Using lots of lube, try it again and see if it doesn't feel much better than the first time. Oh, and either use a condom, or take three or four enemas ahead of time. It's a lot nicer that way.""

""Have you ever done three men at once, Jessica?"" Sue asked.

""I'm a slut. I did five once, using both of my hands. See."" I pulled up my shirt and showed them my belly tattoo, then pulled down my pants so they could see the tattoos on my mons. ""Total slut. Beware hanging around me too much.""

""Why do you have wolf tattoos?"" James asked, somewhat shocked I'd just shown him my coochie.

""My Master's name is Whelan. It means wolf in Irish. Call me when you know for sure what you want to do. I don't even have to remain in town to arrange it. Whoever it is, will be is guaranteed clean and healthy. They even clean up after themselves.""

""What do you mean?"" Sue asked.

""They lick up all the cum dripping out of you.""

""Oh, my.""

******

We stopped off to see Melanie on the way back to my parent's place. Like Gretchen, she was more pregnant than I was.

She was happy. She was still working, though shorter hours.

""Where are your bodyguards?"" I asked.

""They don't come in during the day, hanging around in a car outside in four hour shifts. After Martin gets home, one will come in sometimes for the evening, so it doesn't look so suspicious, like I'm having a gentleman caller when my husband's away.""",,2025-08-15T19:08:34.013997,3563,
https://www.literotica.com/s/tempting-trevor-pt-01,Tempting Trevor Pt. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"Synopsis:

To 20-year-old Stacy, other people are just toys to satisfy her perverted need for sexual control. Home for the summer from college, and having already conquered her parents, Stacy has her sights set on her 18-year-old brother, Trevor. Only a few obstacles stand in the way. The first is Trevor's cute little girlfriend, Mary. The other is that Trevor has never viewed his sister in a sexual light. Unfortunately for him, Trevor is a sweet, sexually inexperienced boy with the usual raging hormones. Will young Trevor and his girlfriend be able to resist his seductress sister, and her cadre of equally hot and slutty friends? Trevor's summer vacation is about to get a lot... harder.

Prologue: Cute

Mary was just so damn cute, but just that. Cute. Trevor's hand slid up her tummy to cup her small breast, but she delicately pulled his hand away, allowing him to continue kissing her, but hesitant to go any further. After a year of dating, Trevor was finding it difficult. He was always horny these days, just out of high school, with the whole summer break ahead, and his girlfriend was cock-blocking him again.

Trevor was a gentleman, though. He respected girls, treated them politely, and Mary was no different. If she wanted to wait, he would hold out, take care of himself, and be patient. That was one of his greatest qualities, he was told. Patience.

Mary kissed her boyfriend back and placed his hand back on her tummy. Trevor contented himself with the feel of her soft skin, teasing as it was. She knew she couldn't hold off Trevor's advances forever. Boys wanted girls to put out, but she wasn't ready for that.

She was supposed to save it and be sure that he was the one. That was what they had drilled into her, and that was what was right, she knew. It was getting more difficult, though. Whenever he kissed and touched her, it didn't feel exciting. It felt scary. She'd imagine his penis, big and hard and angry, ready to shove its way into her body, where he'd pump her full of a billion tiny sperm.

Trevor pulled away, looking flushed, then suggested, ""Maybe we should hit the pool for a while?""

""Yes! I'll go change!""

She flew from the couch and ducked into the bathroom, her backpack in her hand. Trevor went to his room, changed into a pair of swim shorts, and then returned to find Mary waiting in a cute one-piece suit. He looked her over, from her cute freckled face, down her slim body, to her lean legs. Everything about her was just cute. So cute.

Chapter 1: Home for the Summer

Stacy wheeled into the driveway of her parents' home and parked the car, snagging her bag from the back seat before heading inside. The house was quiet and empty, both of her parents gone to work, but as she looked out through the glass doors of the living room, she caught the sight of her brother and his little girlfriend splashing in the pool.

Stacy smiled and felt a flutter in her stomach. This was an opportunity she could not miss. She cut through the hallway and up the stairs to her room. She found it, just as she'd left it on her last visit from college. Neat. Tidy. Everything in its place. She rooted through her drawers and found the perfect suit. It was a few years old, and her tits had grown a bit since she'd last worn it. It was just right. She stripped down and donned the too-small suit, then tied her black hair back in a ponytail.

Trevor and Mary floated lazily on their backs in the summer sun, the warmth of the pool water enveloping them pleasantly. Insects hummed. Birds called. A slight breeze drifted across the backyard. They were at peace. One with nature.

The sound of the glass door sliding aside broke the tranquility of the moment. Mary was the first to look up, and she couldn't help but stare. She wasn't a lesbian or anything, but she could acknowledge beauty when she saw it, and Trevor's older sister was certainly a beauty. Her long, black hair, tied back in a ponytail, swished back and forth as she stepped across the concrete patio. The suit she wore-what little of it there was-exposed more of her body than it hid. And what a body.

Mary flushed as she caught herself looking at the bulging mounds of titflesh barely concealed by the tiny suit. Stacy's flat, toned stomach was like a chiseled statue, and her lean legs were sculpted to perfection. She'd met Stacy before, briefly, and she'd felt completely inadequate as a woman, then. Now, though, seeing just how incredible her naturally tanned body actually was, she felt like a little girl. She was a little girl, compared to that. Her own tits were barely mosquito bites, more nipple than tit. Her freckled face had nothing on Stacy's clear, unmarred beauty.

Trevor called from behind her, ""Hey, sis! When did you get home?""

Mary heard him splashing through the water behind her. Stacy took a leap into the pool, sending a splash of warm water into Mary's face, and making her sputter. She came up, slicked back her hair with a grin, and waded towards her younger brother. He caught her up in a hug that lasted no more than was appropriate.

""I just got in,"" Stacy answered. ""Then I saw you two dorks in the pool, and it was just what I needed after the drive. I swear my ass fell asleep, and my back is killing me.""

""Oh!"" Trevor exclaimed. ""I'm sure Mary could help with that. She's going to start massage therapy classes over the summer. She's fantastic.""

They both turned expectantly toward Mary. Stacy draped her arms over Trevor's shoulders, pushing her big tits into his back, and stroking her fingers casually over his muscular chest. Mary felt a flush creep over her. She caught herself thinking that the two of them looked... a bit sexy together.

""I... Um, sure."" She stammered.

""Really?"" Stacy asked, her voice rising. ""That would be so awesome. You can lotion me up,"" then she added, ""If you don't mind.""

""No, it's fine.""

Mary followed Stacy out of the pool. As the older girl mounted the steps, Mary was treated to the sight of her blatantly exposed ass. God, some girls just had it all, she thought, with a twinge of jealousy. They moved under the shade of the awning, where Stacy snatched a towel and sunscreen from a cupboard, threw the towel down on one of the loungers, and laid on her chest. She offered the bottle to Mary, who took it.

Mary squeezed the bottle of lotion as Stacy unsnapped her bikini top and let it fall away. Even her bare sides were perfect, Mary thought, not a flaw in the skin. She bent down and went to work, smearing the lotion from the small of Stacy's back up to her shoulders, and then down again, giving her a nice, even coating to lubricate her motions. Then she got to it, kneading, rubbing. She felt the tension drain out of Stacy's muscles and she purred happily.

""God, Trev was right. You are good at this. I can only imagine what those hands do to him."" She said, eyes shut as she grinned.

""Yeah. He seems to like my massages,"" Mary agreed, oblivious to the innuendo.

""He's looking good,"" Stacy said. ""It's pretty amazing what a year and some time in the gym can do, don't you think?""

Mary glanced over to the pool, where Trevor had resumed his lazy floating, soaking in the sunshine. Stacy was right, of course. Trevor had filled out, gaining definition and muscle. He was damned good looking. She felt that brief surge of fear in her gut.

Stacy caught the familiar quaver of uncertainty in her voice, and knew it immediately. Inadequacy. Mary knew that her boyfriend was way out of her league. There were dozens of girls like her in school. Stacy had turned a few of them into dedicated little pussy slaves. It couldn't have been more perfect.

""Yeah,"" she agreed, ""He's been working really hard on it.""

Stacy chatted with her idly, asking about her upcoming classes, how long she'd been doing massage, just making pleasant conversation. From the pool, Trevor gave the two of them an occasional glance. It was kind of hot, he thought, watching Mary's hands glide across his sister's skin, her face pursed in concentration. He knew from experience what Stacy was feeling. Mary was great.

""Those cute little hands feel amazing,"" Stacy said honestly. ""Do you think you could do my glutes, too? And the legs?""

""Um, sure.""

Mary's hands shook a bit, making Stacy smile inwardly. She squirted more lotion into her hands.

""Let me help."" Stacy said, and lifted her butt into the air, hooking her fingers into the band of her bottoms, and sliding them down, completely exposing herself to Mary's stunned eyes. Mary swallowed. She was going to have to get used to this, she thought. There would be plenty of nude massages in her future if she was serious about this. Stacy dropped the little thong next to the lounger and parted her legs slightly. Mary's trembling hands tentatively touched Stacy's bare ass and then spread the lotion across her firm cheeks.

Stacy groaned delightfully as Mary's hands dug into the muscle and worked, then slid down one leg, back up, then down the other, spreading the lotion in an even coat. Trevor took note as well, trying not to be too obvious, but... wow! He'd seen Stacy remove her bottoms. Even now, he was sure that his girlfriend was getting a look at his sister's pussy. Maybe she was even touching it. No, that was just his hormones talking. He must be worked up from his earlier make-out session with Mary. Mary would never touch another girl. That was something slutty girls did, and that was not Mary.

Still, it didn't stop him from fantasizing a bit as he floated along dreamily. As they got older, things might change. Maybe Mary would find that she enjoyed doing things with girls. Maybe they'd do other things with girls together, like the swingers in pornos did. His dick hardened a little at the mental image of Mary touching another girl's pussy. Another girl with long, black hair, who was definitely not his sister.

After several more minutes, Mary felt that she'd completed her task, and wiped her hands with a towel. Stacy turned around and sat up, facing away from Trevor, but completely exposed to Mary. Mary's mouth fell open as she took in the sight of Stacy's exposed breasts, big and round, topped with small, dark nipples. Stacy, outwardly, took no notice, but inwardly she was exultant. She ignored Mary's look of shock as she snapped her top back together, then fished for her bottoms. Stacy spread her legs, giving Mary an unobstructed view of her shaved pussy, while she casually slipped her bottoms back up her legs. She stood and gave Mary a quick brief peck on the lips.

""Thanks so much, baby. That was great!"" She said, honestly, with a little wink, ""I am definitely gonna get a lot of use out of you over the summer.""

Mary felt a quiver of arousal shoot down her body at that light, friendly little peck. It was the words that followed, though, that made her flush. More massages. Stacy was going to need more massages over the summer. Stupid, she thought. What else could she mean? Stupid, Mary.

Stacy shouted, ""Cannonball!"" and made a rush for the pool, dove in. She heard Trevor sputter and yell as he took an enormous splash to the face. Mary followed, but took the steps into the water. The three of them lounged in the water chatting, and then played Monkey in the Middle with a beach ball. When Mary was the monkey, though, she stood no chance. She was too short compared to the two siblings. She attempted to leap for the ball, but failed each time. Finally, Stacy pulled her throw and let Mary win. While Mary thought it was nice, it made her feel foolish.

Then, it was Stacy's turn in the middle. Trevor threw the ball high over his sister's head, treating Mary to the sight of Stacy's tits bouncing wildly as she leapt for the ball, missed. Mary retrieved it and was successful in passing it back. Again, Mary stood transfixed by the way those bulging boobs bounced as she leapt. Stacy managed to get her fingers on the ball on the next pass, though, which put Trevor back in the middle. The time slipped away, until they'd finally had enough of the pool, and they hauled themselves out of the water.

Stacy put her arm around Mary's shoulders as they walked back into the house, and that made Mary feel good. Like she'd been accepted.

""Come on upstairs and clean up with me,"" Stacy said invitingly, ""let's girl talk!""

Mary did not do much in the way of ""girl talk"". Her friends mainly comprised other girls from her mother's church group, which she was forced to attend each Wednesday evening and Sunday morning. Mary didn't mind church. It was ok. It just wasn't all that fun. The girls were nice, but they didn't talk about much other than TV shows, Jesus, and their cats.

Mary threw a glance back at Trevor, hoping for escape, but her boyfriend just waved with his silly little grin and said, ""have fun!""

He spread a towel on the couch and reached for the remote as Mary was practically dragged away by his sister. It would do good for Mary to have a girl who wasn't a Churcher to talk to, he thought. Maybe it would loosen her up a bit. Stacy was thinking the same. Almost.

Chapter 2: Dolly

Mary's heart was in her throat as Stacy dragged her into the bathroom and shut the door. The college girl started the shower and let the water run. Mary stood in shocked silence. Stacy expected them to shower together? In their suits, surely. She knew other girls did stuff like that, changing together and seeing each other naked, but Mary wasn't one of those girls. Stacy was older, though, an experienced college girl. She was so hot that she probably had lots of other hot girlfriends who were naked with each other when they changed and talked about boys. Maybe they did other things with each other, too. Stacy certainly wasn't shy.

Stacy stripped off her bikini, and Mary drank in the sight of her nude body. She was trapped in a tiny room with a girl she'd only met previously for a few hours over Christmas, and here she was, completely naked. Stacy turned to frightened Mary, a look of casual expectation on her face. Oh, God! She expected Mary to get naked, too!

""Oh,"" Stacy said, suddenly, ""you're a little shy?""

""I...""

""Oh, baby, it's ok."" Stacy cooed, and hugged her naked body against Mary. ""You've got nothing to be shy about. Look at you!""

She peeled the straps of Mary's suit off of her shoulders, and Mary shivered. She let Stacy pull the straps down and pulled her arms free of them. Stacy peeled the suit down, exposing Mary's tiny tits and hard nipples.

""Oh, my God! You have the cutest little boobies!"" Stacy squealed.

Mary blushed in embarrassment. Little boobies. She didn't have big, gorgeous tits like a woman. Like Stacy. She was 18 and had little girl boobies.

""Oh, honey,"" Stacy said, ""They're so perfect. Why are you ashamed? I'll tell you, it's not all it's cracked up to be toting these big, heavy things around.""

She cupped her big tits and shook them enticingly to emphasize the point. Then she took hold of Mary's suit again and pulled it down her legs, exposing the rest of her lean body.

""You're like a precious little dolly,"" Stacy said, and stroked Mary's cheek with the back of her hand. ""I could just eat you up!""

Mary looked away, embarrassed, as Stacy's eyes raked over her body.

""Come on,"" Stacy commanded, taking Mary's hand, ""Let's get cleaned up.""

Mary allowed herself to be led into the shower with the other girl. The hot spray of water pelted down over their bodies. Stacy squeezed out a thick dollop of shampoo into her hands and smeared it into Mary's red hair, lathering it up. The older girl smiled warmly at her, and Mary felt a little better. Then Stacy took a bottle of body wash and squeezed it into her hands, rubbing them together. She smeared the wash onto Mary's neck, and then across her shoulders.

""Let me return the favor."" She whispered and turned Mary around.

Mary let herself be turned, and felt Stacy's soft hands rub the gooey wash into her tense shoulders, down her back, up her sides.

""Just relax, baby,"" Stacy said in her ear, breath warm, her tone soothing.

The feel of the older girl's hands on her body was making Mary feel funny, like she did when Trevor tried to feel her tits. No, her boobies. She felt herself relaxing, melting into the feeling of Stacy's stroking hands on her body. Stacy's bare breasts pressed against her back, and she could feel her hard nipples poking into her shoulders. Her hands spread the lather over Mary's flat tummy, and then up, up, until her hands passed lightly over Mary's excited nipples. She let out a small moan. Stacy's hands stayed where they were, working the lather over Mary's breasts as she continually pinched and massaged her nipples.

Mary was so confused. How had she got into this situation? There was something about the older girl that just made her want to follow. Like she was a pet. She'd never felt anything like what was happening to her right now. It felt so good!

""Do you like that?"" Stacy asked in her ear. ""It feels so nice, doesn't it?""

Mary nodded, unable to speak.

""I'll bet Trevor just loves these little boobies, doesn't he?""

Mary panted with excitement.

""I'll bet he sucks on them every chance he gets."" Stacy said.

""No... he... we haven't..."" Mary caught herself stuttering.

""Oh my God,"" Stacy hissed, ""You totally haven't done it with him, have you?""

Mary shook her head.

One of Stacy's hands stayed on her nipple, gently pinching and rolling it in her fingers, but her other hand slid lower. Mary knew where it was going, but she felt powerless, like she was Stacy's toy. Like a little dolly. Stacy found her target, slipping her hand between Mary's legs. Mary parted her thighs for her, like it was Stacy's right to touch her there. She hadn't even let Trevor touch her like this, but here she was, giving his sister full access to her body like she owned it.

""Doesn't my little brother want to touch your cute little cunny?"" Stacy said, stroking her.

""Yes... he... he wants to...""

""He's so big and handsome, isn't he?""

""Uh huh...""

""I'll bet he'd be a beast in bed,"" Stacy mused in her ear. ""Do you think he'd break you? Cute little Mary and her precious little cunny. Do you think you could handle a man like that? So big, strong, all those hard muscles.""

Mary twitched against Stacy's hand as she found her clit and teased it.

""I'll bet he's got a really big cock,"" Stacy said, ""but you're scared of it, aren't you?""

""Yes!"" Mary admitted.

""You're afraid of how much it might hurt when he puts it in you, aren't you?""

""Yes!""

Stacy worked Mary's clit gently, back and forth, her fingers sliding easily through the younger girl's wet slit.

""You're afraid you'll do it wrong, and he won't be happy, right?""

Mary agreed.

""You think you won't be good enough for that big man cock."" Stacy stated.

Mary bit her lip and pushed her pelvis against Stacy's fingers. God, she was going to cum! She was going to cum on her boyfriend's sister's hand!

""You'd feel so bad if he didn't enjoy your little cunny, wouldn't you?""

""Oh, God!""

""It's ok, baby,"" Stacy cooed. ""It's ok. Just let it happen. It's all ok. I'm right here.""

Mary squeaked, and rubbed herself against Stacy's hand, and then in a burst of pleasure, she orgasmed, biting her lip to hold in a scream. She'd masturbated before, but this was so different, so much better. She'd never felt anything like it. It was like fireworks in her head. Stacy rubbed her, pinched her nipples, and held her close, the heat of her skin against Mary's as she quaked and shuddered, letting herself go.

""That's it,"" Stacy said, ""Just let it go. Cum for me, baby. That's so good. Good girl. That's my little dolly. You're so cute, baby.""

Chapter 3: Familial Dynamics

Mary left in a hurry, following her shower with Stacy.

""Gotta get home for dinner."" She said to Trevor, giving him a quick peck on the lips before rushing out the door.",,2025-08-15T19:08:38.178217,3548,

***

Various cups, cans and bottles remained littered around the living room. It was the sign of a good night, but more realistically, it was a sign that someone was going to have a tedious morning cleaning the apartment. That someone would in fact be me, Ken, the sole occupant of the apartment located in a fairly quiet, secluded part of town. I was a year older today, ostensibly, and as you get older you take on new responsibilities which apparently entailed cleaning up after your own party.

It had been a fun night filled with drinking and party games, the usual fare for these sort of events. The only knock against it was the sour attitude my girlfriend Willow had all night long. Willow was for the most part a quiet girl, usually with her nose in a book or vegetating on the couch watching some old 90s TV show. I never had issues with her. No, it wasn't that at all. She seemed to have issues with literally everyone else in the world though.

Willow was often mistaken for a very sweet, charming girl and she certainly looked the part; standing at about 5'6 with very thick, long brown hair which framed an innocent face. She usually didn't wear much of an expression, but she was usually very vocal to me about how she felt. I had a theory, that if she wasn't slender and have a nice ass and perky B cup tits that less people would think of her as charming. It was just a theory since I didn't want to accept that this was in all likelihood the obvious truth.

Various people were still at my place, helping me clean up before taking their leave for the night. Willow was not one of them. No, she had some bookstore conference to attend this weekend, flying out tomorrow morning upstate to spend the weekend among other book nerds. She lived on the other side of town and this precluded her from aiding me in throwing out the trash- claiming she couldn't both help and make her morning flight as a result. Of course, I lamented to myself, if it wasn't the conference it would be something else; she had a headache, she had injured her ankle, or some other excuse.

As I paused to open up the large black trash bag I was stuffing all the refuse into, letting one of my friends discard some cups before he too departed, I noticed one last guest still lingering around my place. It was Mallory, the main source of Willow's resentment tonight.

You see, Willow and Mallory are what you could consider ""frenemies"". Despite hating each other, they still pretended to be friends. Nearly everyone knew there was a source of friction between them, and openly acknowledged as much. Everyone of course, except Willow and Mallory themselves. I wasn't exactly sure what the source of the tension was exactly, all I knew was that Willow would have gotten mad I didn't invite Mallory since it'd make HER look bad, but that she also would if I did because I had. As a result, I had to send a very awkward invitation via text message to Mallory, attempting to sound as enthused as I could. There was no way to win here. For my part, I didn't interact much with Mallory, but she seemed fine. She seemed to find me funny based on her quiet laughs at every one of my remarks tonight, but Willow had told me this was merely to spite her.

Mallory was cute- objectively speaking of course. Standing at about 5'3, she was shorter than Willow. They were night and day, almost literally in that Mallory sported shorter platinum blonde hair in contrast to Willow's longer mane. She kept it simple as well, keeping it simply down with a large side swept bang in the front; her asymmetrical hair didn't even touch her shoulders, but it had a lot of volume to it, bustling out a bit. Despite standing a few inches shorter, Mallory had larger breasts- easily C cups. When you're that short, it's bound to stick out but for the most part, I hadn't seen her wear anything that revealed a hint of cleavage before. Not that I was paying that much attention of course. Or that I had browsed her pictures on social media. I was a guy, it was all natural, I told myself.

Mallory also had striking features- a well defined but soft jawline, high cheekbones, everything. If she had been inches taller she'd be a natural model. At the very least she could have steady employment as an Eva Green impersonator if she dyed her hair, in my eyes anyway. The girl also had very expressive eyes, which were currently focused on me. I felt a bit on the spot, especially no one else in sight. Mallory was a bit of a Stepford-smiler, often looking well-dressed, presentable and saying very little. Everything about her seemed calculating, and prepared. I hadn't approached her for any extended period of time though,to be fair.

""Uh, hey Mal."" I offered with a lazy smile.

""Hmm. Mal."" she said repeating back the on the spot nickname I coined. ""I like that.""

Very little in her voice sounded genuine about that statement. The ominous rainwater outside did very little to ease the tension in the room. Maybe she was going to kill me.

""I'm turning in once I'm done cleaning up,"" I began. ""So, uh.""

""Quiet birthday party."" she stated, grabbing a cup off the bookshelf next to her and placing it in my bag seemingly ignoring my statement. ""Unless you've got Willow bound and gagged back there."" she said turning her head towards my bedroom.

""I mean, gagged maybe..."" I said half jokingly. Immediately I regretted this, not because it wasn't true, but because giving Mallory any ammunition would result in my life being hell for the foreseeable future. I then pursed my lips tight and said no more.

Mallory of course laughed, by which I mean she emitted one of those sexy girl haughty chortles devoid of any real joy. She turned back towards me and for a split second, I saw a glint of...something in her eye. It was as though her face eased up and relaxed for a passing moment before she adopted her Stepford smile once more. Willow had described Mallory as a bit of a seductress at best and a hussy at worst, meaning I would be wise to keep my distance in case whatever was currently happening ever happened.

""Hey,"" she said in a softer voice before miming her hand zipping her mouth shut. ""I won't tell her you said what we all thought tonight.""

I felt slightly at ease, but part of me knew she was trying to get me to spill some more beans.

""She had a long day,"" I offered. I couldn't take back my earlier comment but I could try and lessen the impact. ""She was on edge for that um, conference thing she has this weekend."" I looked over at her ruefully, offering a tired smile. Mallory wore a short sleeve black and white dress with a white Peter Pan collar, which itself was a fairly innocent, conservative number but on her body it looked anything but that. I have to admit though, I absolutely loved it- I have a bit of a penchant for old fashion I guess.

""Aw, hope me showing up didn't ruin your birthday."" she said with an exaggerated pout. Mallory was certainly trying, but she came off all too strong here. I wonder if she realized this wasn't as sultry or playful as she probably thought it was.

""Nah, it's fine. I didn't mind you being here Mal,"" I said. ""I don't really see all the hullabaloo with you and her or whatever. I mean you seem you know, alright.""

""Alright?"" she asked a bit quizzically, smirking a bit.

""I mean, you don't seem bad I guess. You seem pretty sweet to me anyway.""

""Oh, I can be plenty bad too."" she said walking up to me. Her sudden approach made me drop the trash bag and take a step back.

""Uh, not badly dressed though!"" I stupidly offered. ""That's a gorgeous dress. I love Peter Pan collars.""

My words seemed to strike a chord with her, and she stopped in her tracks and looked down at her outfit. She took a long glance over it and looked back up at me, wearing a goofy but demure smile. There was a genuine appreciation in it, for once.

""Thanks!"" she said in a squeaky voice. ""But trust me it looks better off of me on the ground."" she said in an overly sultry voice. Mal took a few steps closer to me and wrapped her arms around me in a tight hug, pulling me in and refusing to let go. In theory, I rejected this hug, but it was just that, a hug. It didn't help that Mal gave me a very tight, affectionate hug where I could feel every inch of her body pressing up against mine, but it was still just a hug.

Not for long though, as Mallory looked up at me with the most over the top ""fuck me"" eyes I've seen. It wouldn't have been hard to throw her off of me, I stood about 5'9 and while a bit on the trim side, she was pretty small. She might have been drunk though, I thought, and throwing a drunk girl against the wall or my couch was probably not the best of ideas.

""Mallory, stop!"" I told her. Evidently the pen is not mightier than the sword as my words had no effect on her.

""Just one kiss,"" she said quietly and closing in. She got her wish, reaching up around my neck and pulling me down so it was easier for her to kiss me. I tried to pull away, but she resisted. She was a good kisser, that was my initial, shameful thought. Her lips were all enveloping, overwhelming me but still maintaining a soft, delicate touch. It felt so fucking amazing, almost otherworldly to feel her face pressed up against mine and I didn't even realize her mouth opened, allowing my tongue to slide into hers.

Mallory immediately accepted my tongue, making a small moaning noise that began as a low hum but quickly grew into a loud moan once our tongues intertwined. I could feel one of her hands grab the back of my shirt, clutching the fabric tight at the expense of scratching my back a bit. Curiously, I didn't feel the other hand. Maybe she had a knife in it and this was the end.

I was kissing Mallory! Fuck! Coming back to my senses, I pulled away from her.

""Oh fuck!"" I uttered. Mallory looked dazed for a second before clearing her throat and taking a step back from me.

""Aw, but we were having so much fun!"" she said before giggling to herself. My face grew pale by the second, and I wasn't sure if it was colder outside in the rain or in my veins. ""Don't worry,"" she said pouting again. ""I won't TELL Willow.""

I wondered why she placed so much emphasis on the tell part. Probably not good. She then turned away from me and towards the door, shaking her pert ass at me a bit and walking towards the door.

""WAIT!"" I called out, getting her to turn around again. Stupidly, my first thought wasn't to try and get her silence or apologize, but out of concern. ""It's raining pretty bad out,"" I said walking over to my closet and grabbing one of my jackets. ""Here you'll get wet.""

Why the fuck did I say that? Better yet? Why the FUCK did I offer her a jacket? She was obviously going to blackmail me! Mallory for her part looked confused, but walked over and looked over the cozy, quilted jacket. I held it out, allowing her to slide her arms in the sleeves, like a true gentleman now of all times.

""Oh this is cozy!"" she said with some glee, hugging herself. The material was the soft shell type, that made the swoosh sound when it rubbed together, a fact Mallory noticed right away. ""It's all swishy!"" she said excitedly, rubbing the arms of the jacket against the body. This was the single most surreal moment of the night, as she smiled at me with a goofy grin before clearing her throat again. ""But um, thanks.""

Mallory walked towards the door, with me in tow.

""I'm sure we'll look back at this and laugh. I mean, I know I will. Happy Birthday, Kenny! Bye!"" she said laughing and walking out the door.

I clenched the door frame and grimaced. I was an absolute idiot.

***

The dress had cost me nearly $70, a markup if I've ever seen one in my life. Vintage Clothing Central? I thought to myself. More like comedy central, those prices were absolute jokes. Still, it was dry clean only, and Ken was more than willing to let me wear his jacket in the rain.

What an odd thing to do, I thought to myself as I reached the bottom of the stairs. I pulled out my phone and looked at the various pictures I had taken of him kissing me. The first looked too accidental, as if I had pulled him onto me and he wasn't expecting it. I mean, that is literally how it had gone down, but they looked too fake. It wasn't until I scrolled to the next few that they looked genuine. I stopped, looking at one of my head tilted back, hand clutching his back. If I wasn't trying to get back at his slut of a girlfriend, I probably would have found it romantic. I mean, it was a cute picture on its own anyway.

I couldn't send them now, obviously. Willow was probably asleep or was on her plane- wouldn't see it until tomorrow morning. Best bet would be to send it tomorrow afternoon when she was tired and would have to stew on it all night.

Rain continued to fall down, hard. I reached for the hood and pulled it over my head, peering out from the entryway of the apartment complex. The sky was cloudy, an ugly mess, and it didn't look like rain would let up. The cold air made my legs shiver, but lucky for me, the jacket Ken let me borrow was a damn god send.

Ugh, Ken.

I turned my head back inside, looking at the staircase leading up. I didn't give a single shit about hurting Willow, but seeing him offer me the jacket- including slipping it on of all things- was so genuine! Truth be told, I didn't know much about him; he was fucking Willow and had jackets to spare. I had wondered what Willow saw in him on more than one occasion. Willow never seemed the type to date or to enjoy male company, especially back in college when all she did was drink too much wine and get sloppy or hole herself up in her dorm room and read. Even when I visited her school, she hardly wanted to go out, just get sloppy drunk and talk shit about girls in her dorm building. Just thinking about how catty she was made my blood boil, enough to push the doubt from my mind. It wasn't even my plan anyway. 'Sorry Ken', I whispered to myself as I walked into the night.

My car was parked at the far edge of the parking lot, away from everyone else and a consequence of arriving late. With each further step I cursed myself for not even bothering to look for more parking closer and appreciated the jacket more and more. Ugh, again, thinking about Ken. He was a scrub, a nobody- knock it off Mal.

That was cute though, how he had called me Mal. Poor guy shouldn't have gotten involved with Willow and maybe he wouldn't be soon! He should thank me. No that was awful. Stop thinking, I thought to myself.

I hopped into my car, tossing my purse aside in the passenger seat after fishing the keys out. Much to my dismay though, my car wouldn't start. Stupid thing. I tried again, but the engine not only wouldn't turn over, it didn't even sound like it had any life to it. Fuck. Okay, probably not the most ideal situation. Maybe wait a few seconds and try again, I thought.

I waited approximately all of about 10 entire seconds before trying again. This time, the engine sounded even more tired, letting out a slow, dying whir before stopping altogether. I unbuckled my seat belt and stepped outside, closing the door behind me and walking to the front of my car. It took me less than 5 seconds to remember that the hood opened only from the inside, and it took me even less time to realize I had locked my keys inside the car along with my phone and purse.

Well, shit.

Naturally, I tried to open the door a handful of times, finding no success each time until finally I slammed both fists on the window. Again, this yielded no results. What was there to do? I couldn't get back in. No phone. And a cursory glance around the parking lot was enough to let me know the party goers were all gone by now. The rain didn't let up one bit, and if anything, I could hear the clap of thunder off in the distance. I was going to freeze my legs off at this rate, so I swallowed my pride and turned back towards Ken's place.

Each step made me feel childish, and reminded me of how awful this entire plan was. I hadn't even told my roommate I was planning on heading out tonight, she wouldn't even know where to find me. It was her stupid idea why didn't she come with me? God this was so fucking stupid, I thought to myself as I splashed my feet into the wet blacktop. What would I say to Ken? Sorry I kissed you even though you're dating my sorta friend, can you call me a cab? I suppose I could have hitchhiked. I had lived a decent enough life and wouldn't mind being dumped in a ditch, sans organs naturally. Each step up the stairs felt like I was lugging a backpack full of lead, and my sopping wet feet dragged on the carpet. I arrived at Ken's door and sighed heavily. What was I to say? The truth would be okay, that my car died. Nothing wrong with that at all. Just had to sound confident and sexy like I had before. My hand knocked on the door as I cleared my throat and stood up straight.

""Oh. Hey."" he said apprehensively. Ken clutched the door frame with one hand, the door in the other.

""My car died."" I said in a warbling tone that must have sounded like I died a little inside. It was less sexy and more helpless than anything. I must have looked a sight, drenched and bundled up in his jacket while shivering. Ken looked up up and down and gave me a once over. It felt less like he was checking me out and more like he was reading my intentions. I fully anticipated him to slam the door in my face at this point, but it never came, just more silence. Finally, he sighed and motioned for me to come up.

""Come on, let's get you in."" he told me as if he was taking in a stray cat. It was a bit of added humiliation, but I'd rather be humiliated and warm inside than back out in the rain. I hardly took more than two steps inside when he twirled his finger around, motioning for me to face away. I did so and felt his hands reach for the shoulders of the jacket, pulling it off of me and allowing me to step out of it.

""Such a gentleman."" I cooed, hoping to ease the tension. He took the coat and slung it over a chair near the window. He didn't respond, instead walking right by me down the hall. I wasn't sure what to do, so I took a step in his direction.

""Stay."" he said gently but firmly. My wet shoe squished against the hardwood and I froze in place. I didn't want to track water around his apartment, but also didn't want to let the silence continue.

""Yeah so uh, I tried turning on my car but like, the engine wouldn't you know..."" I said as he disappeared into a room. I wasn't sure if he was even paying attention. How rude. ""Like, turning over or trying or..."" I said again to no one. I stood in place, looking down the hall while cold water ran down my legs. Finally, he popped back out with a towel, ostensibly returning from the bathroom.

""Yeah so like I was saying,"" I started up again, putting in some energy to try and sound pleasant. ""The car-""

""Right the engine wouldn't turn over yeah."" he said. He had been paying attention after all. ""Why not call a tow truck, or a cab or something?""

""Yeah well, see that's the thing,"" I began as he handed me the towel.

""Take off your shoes."" he interrupted.

""Huh?""

""I said take off your shoes and come in."" he added, walking into the living room. He was right, my feet were freezing and standing around wasn't making things better. I plopped down on a nearby stool and unsure where to put them, set them carefully down by the door.

""But yeah, I left my phone and purse in the car."" I looked up and saw him sit down on the couch. He had changed out of the pair of pants he had on earlier and instead wore a pair of sweatpants. ""And...my keys."" I offered weakly.

Ken ran his hand through his hair, looking off into the distance. His lips pursed and face tightened, deep in thought.

""It's 2AM,"" he started, his look still focused on one corner of the room. ""Can't call a locksmith. Can't call a tow truck either."" He clearly sounded as though those 'can'ts' were more 'didn't want to's'.",,2025-08-15T19:08:43.059894,3775,

Gina Walgren insists I can't go home until I've had a shower, and because she's just as sweaty as I am, it's a convenient excuse for her to share the shower with me.

I'm relieved that the shower doesn't have enough room for Steven Walgren to join us, so there won't be another threesome today. We leave him in the bedroom to wait for us while Gina tests the temperature of the water before stepping inside, effectively dragging me in with her.

When she closes the shower door, I suddenly feel trapped. I turn around and face the corner of the shower, hugging my chest for comfort while the lukewarm water pours down on my back.

""No need to be shy after that performance,"" Gina taunts me and forces me to turn around.

Mrs. Walgren has no qualms about being naked in front of me, and looking at her body I can see why. She looks like a statue of Venus with her beautifully curved hips and snatched waist. Her breasts are plump and at least a full cup-size larger than mine, and her crotch is crowned with a neatly trimmed bush the same color as her flowing chestnut hair.

In addition to nervous and vulnerable, I actually feel envious.

""Did you have fun today?"" Gina grabs some body lotion and squirts it all over her chest, as if deliberately showing off how her bust is so much bigger than mine.

""It was...fine,"" I answer hesitantly.

""Steven's great in bed, isn't he?"" As Gina lathers the lotion over her body, I get the sense that she's bragging about being married to such a man. If so, she's welcome to keep him.

""I prefer the gentleman I met in the hotel bar.""

""Fair enough.""

Gina continues lathering the lotion all over her gorgeously toned body while I just stand there. Her presence is intimidating and I'm still burning with shame about what I've signed up for so much that I can't bring myself even to fully soak my hair.

Without warning, Gina unhooks the showerhead and sprays me with it.

""Ah! What the fuck?!"" I swat the showerhead away so that it hits the shower wall with a clang.

""Are you're really gonna just stand there until I turn the water off?"" Gina's smirking at me as she squats down to pick the showerhead up again.

""What the hell was that for?!""

""Didn't you shower with other girls when you were in high school?"" Gina asks as she puts the showerhead back in its holder, ""you were so fiery a few minutes ago, and now you're suddenly bashful about being naked with another woman.""

There's no point in arguing with her about how awkward this is, so I relent and position myself under the showerhead, soaking my hair while trying to keep the water away from my face. I only use waterproof products, but I still don't want to risk causing my makeup to run.

It's impossible to ignore Gina watching me wash myself since she's standing just a few inches away, and I try to avoid making eye contact with her. But she's right in front of me and standing closer than strictly necessary, almost as if she likes forcing me to share my personal space with her. My gaze ends up flitting between the shower wall and her toned stomach.

Every time I look at her body, my eyes go even lower to her neatly trimmed bush. It occurs to me that she might want her husband to share me with her. That possibility makes my heart race as I wonder if she's going to assault me in the shower.

Then again, there might be a clause in the contract saying she can do exactly that.

Gina suddenly closes the distance until her busty chest is touching mine and there's nowhere else in the shower to back away from her. I freeze up and stare at her wide-eyed with fear while making a futile attempt to cover my naked body with my hands.

""I am so looking forward to having you back here next Saturday,"" Gina coos to me, her mouth next to my ear as she speaks in an almost sensual whisper, ""and there's really no need for you to be so afraid. There are certain lines Steven's agreed not to cross.""

""Like what?"" I ask with a fearful gulp.

Gina snorts with laughter and pulls away from me. ""You should read the terms of the contract if you want to find out. But don't worry, he's not gonna be

too

rough with you.""

""Do you seriously enjoy watching your husband fuck other women?"" I ask suddenly.

""I do!"" Gina sounds delighted to share this with me, ""Although, even if I didn't, he'd fuck other women anyway. Successful men feel entitled to whatever they want, especially when it comes to pretty things like you. It just so happens that getting to watch turns me on.""

I start scrubbing myself a lot more vigorously. The sooner I'm clean, the sooner I can get out of the shower, get my clothes back on, and get the fuck away from here.

***

When we're both finished in the shower, Mr. Walgren watches the two of us rub ourselves dry and get dressed. Since he's already put his hands all over my naked body, maintaining some semblance of privacy is pointless. Despite washing and scrubbing myself thoroughly all over, I still feel kind of dirty, and I can still feel his cum leaking out of me.

Once I'm fully dressed, he bids farewell to me before taking his turn in the shower while Mrs. Walgren hands me a copy of the contract, makes me exchange contact information with her, and shoos me out the front door. I strut down the gravel pathway in my high heels feeling both relieved and dirty. I came here for a job interview and I'm leaving feeling like a prostitute.

The drive back to my apartment isn't so bad. The traffic on a Saturday afternoon is almost non-existent, and the more distance I can put between myself and the Walgrens' mansion, the better. I try to concentrate on the road in front of me and not to think about what actually happened, but of course the events won't leave my head.

Once I get back to my apartment, though, all I want to do is bury my face in my pillow and try to cry, feeling used and empty; but the tears won't come. I signed an agreement to be used as a human sex toy by a rich couple in exchange for paying off my mountain of student debt.

My phone buzzes, and I extract it from my handbag. Sure enough, it's a push-notification from my banking app telling me I've received a ten-thousand-dollar wire transfer from another bank account under the name Walgren. At least they're fulfilling their side of the bargain.

They said they'd pay me ten thousand dollars per meeting, which is every Saturday, so for the rest of the year I have to spread my legs and put on a sexy show until I have enough to pay off my debt. I think they also said they'd pay me enough to cover the interest on my three-hundred-thousand-dollar student debt bill, so that implies more than thirty weeks.

The more I ruminate on the situation I've signed myself up for, the more I wonder if ultimately it isn't so bad. After all, Mr. Walgren made me cum, and as long as I don't have to do anything too degrading, I can pay off my debt in a year instead of two decades. Plus, there's no reason I can't keep looking for a regular Monday-to-Friday job to supplement my income.

I roll onto my back and sit up on my bed, pulling my knees into my chest and hugging them as I gaze around at my modest little home. I don't have a lot of decorations up, just my diploma, framed and hanging on the wall, declaring in elaborate Latin calligraphy that I have a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA.

Three hundred thousand dollars in student debt for a degree in sociology. After what Mr. and Mrs. Walgren forced me to do today, I officially regret not caving into my parents' pressure to study accounting instead. I could always take the LSAT and go to law school once the Walgrens release me from their sex slave contract, but that would require going into even more student debt. At this rate, I'd be better off working as a paid escort.

I keel over until I'm lying on my side, curled up in a ball of self pity as I contemplate what the future holds. I'm not sure whom I hate more: Mr. Walgren for using me or Mrs. Walgren for facilitating it, but it does remind me that I should read the contract to familiarize myself with exactly what I was stupid enough to sign up for.

I can do that later. For now, I just want to rest.

***

The week passes in a blur, and before I know it, Saturday morning has arrived and I'm back at the Walgrens' mansion at midday sharp -- just like Gina Walgren told me in her text.

Once again, she's the one to answer the door when I arrive, although this time she's wearing a navy blue dress with a plunging V-neck instead of a bathrobe. She looks me up and down like a cat appraising a mouse, noting my jeans and blouse, before ushering me inside.

""Are you hungry?"" Gina asks me as I follow her upstairs.

""I can wait until lunch."" I'm wondering why she told me to wear whatever I wanted when she's already dressed up. ""Where's St...Mr. Walgren?""

""You can call him Steven if you want to,"" Gina answers good-naturedly, ""and he'll be joining us for lunch when he's finished in his office, so there's plenty of time for you to get ready.""

I pause near the top of the steps. ""What, for lunch?"" I sound puzzled as I ask, but that feeling gives way to apprehension almost immediately.

""Don't look so nervous, it's nothing too bad,"" Gina admonishes me with an amused smile, ""and even if it were, you've already signed the contract.""

I grit my teeth and follow Gina towards the master bedroom, my heart pounding and my hands trembling. Having read the contract, there are certain things which it stipulates are off limits in terms of how the Walgrens can treat me, but it's a short list.

The master bedroom is as spacious and immaculate as I remember it. It also brings back some uncomfortable memories of what happened the previous Saturday, but at least Steven Walgren isn't here. Instead, there's a black dress laid out on the bed with a pair of strappy high heels on the floor at the foot of the bed.

""That's for you,"" Gina informs me, pointing at the dress and heels, ""I'll be waiting outside.""

She leaves and shuts the door behind her, leaving me alone and feeling surprised that she isn't going to watch me change clothes. Even so, it's nice to have some privacy for once.

As I remove my blouse and lay it on the bed next to the dress, I notice that there's also a black thong. I remember Gina sneering at the cotton panties I wore last Saturday and guess she wants me to wear something sexier this time around. There's no bra for some reason, but I'm not wearing one right now, so I probably won't need one to wear this dress.

I unbutton my jeans and tug them down my legs, grateful that I exercise regularly enough that my body looks decent. Of course, it doesn't compare to Mrs. Walgren's toned curves, and if I'm being completely honest, I'm actually envious of how good she looks in her forties.

Before long, my jeans, blouse, and underwear are lying in a neatly folded pile on the bed next to the clothes Gina's selected for me. I slip the thong on and immediately feel sexier. The dress is an off the shoulder cocktail dress which looks very low cut, and I pull it over my head and shoulders before tugging the hem down past my hips.

There's a problem. The neckline isn't just cut low, it actually exposes my breasts. I check the dress, wondering if I put it on correctly, but it's definitely on the right way. I search for the tags to see if Gina got my measurements wrong, but there aren't any tags.

Then I notice this dress doesn't have any labels or logos at all. It's not from any clothing brand that I can tell, and it looks custom-made -- and apparently designed to expose my chest.

My cheeks light up and I storm over to the door and throw it open in anger, glaring furiously at Gina who's leaning against the banister.

""What the fuck is this?!""

""It's the dress we had made especially for you,"" Gina responds with an innocent smile.

""Why is it designed this way?"" I demand angrily, pointing to my bare boobs.

""Why do you think?"" Gina struts over to me until she's almost in my face, looming over me in her high heels. ""Steven wants to see your chest for lunch, so we had this dress made and tailored especially for that, hence why there's no bra.""

""I don't see you being forced to expose yourself,"" I complain.

Gina reaches up to her own cleavage and pulls the parts of her dress covering her breasts apart to either side, casually exposing her much more buxom chest to me. Her shameless -- or perhaps confident -- self-exposure stuns me into silence.

""Does that make you feel better?""

She's mocking me, I'm sure of it. She wants to humiliate me to compensate for the fact that her husband prefers to fuck me rather than her. Why else is she doing this to me?

""Lunch is almost ready,"" Gina informs me as she covers herself up again, ""put your heels on and meet me downstairs in five minutes; and don't forget: you signed the contract.""

***

I arrive in the dining room wearing my breast-baring cocktail dress with my cheeks on fire. The dress also leaves my legs bare with the hem stopping about halfway down my thighs, and the cool air in the dining room causes an outbreak of goosebumps across my exposed skin.

The dining table is circular, and Mr. and Mrs. Walgren are already seated, the former dressed in a business suit with a silver tie. I see the corners of his mouth curl into a smile at the sight of the nervous young Asian woman with her chest exposed for his enjoyment.

""A pleasure to see you again, Ms. Park,"" Steven Walgren greets me.

""Likewise,"" I lie politely as I take my seat.

The food has already been served: Salmon lightly seasoned with salt and lemon with spinach and roast potatoes as well as a glass of red wine next to each of our plates. I'm wary of drinking given my situation, but since I'm being compelled to eat lunch partly naked, I guess it doesn't really make a difference whether my hosts ply me with alcohol.

Steven Walgren's eyes linger on my breasts before Gina taps his hand. The couple raise their glasses and I tentatively follow suit.

""To business and pleasure,"" Steven toasts.

""To business and pleasure,"" Gina repeats.

""May they respect one another's boundaries,"" I quip soberly.

The Walgrens snort with laughter, causing the wine in their glasses to swish dangerously.

""Preferably after enumerating them in the form of a written contract,"" Steven replies.

The couple tap their glasses together with a clink and they each gulp down a mouthful of wine. I take a single cautious sip from my own glass before putting it down carefully.

I almost forget that my boobs are on display as I start eating, and my hosts don't say a word as they tuck into their lunches. I notice Steven Walgren glancing at my chest every minute or so, and instead of feeling self-conscious, I feel a sense of awkward tension knowing he's going to fuck me after lunch while his wife watches.

Gina is just as quiet and composed as her husband, making the fact that they're dining with a topless guest even weirder. She glances at me every few mouthfuls and I do my utmost to avoid making eye contact with her. I also take care not to spill anything on my exposed chest.

As the minutes tick by and we scrape the last of our food off our plates, I reconsider my aversion to the wine. If I'm going to enjoy their hospitality before being used as a sex toy, I may as well avail myself of the alcohol to feel a little better about my situation.

I finish my wine one careful gulp at a time. Having eaten most of my food, the wine will take longer to affect me, but I'm already starting to feel woozy. The wine has a strong fruity taste, and the half-empty bottle sitting on the table tells me it's from the Napa Valley region.

Steven and Gina have already finished eating and are casually sipping the remaining dregs from their glasses. They exchange silent glances as if gossiping telepathically about me while I try to finish my meal. Steven's eyes keep returning to my bare breasts, but by this point I no longer care. He's welcome to leer at me like the pervert he is while his nasty wife watches.

At last, I chew and swallow the last mouthful of food, placing my cutlery together on the plate, and wiping the corner of my mouth. Then I sit there in silence, waiting for what happens next.

""That was delicious,"" Gina says with a beaming smile.

""It was, yes,"" Steven agrees, then turns to me, ""it looks like you enjoyed your lunch, too.""

""I did, thank you."" I'm trying to be polite, but I can tell I'm going to be dessert.

""You don't prefer kimchi or noodles?"" Gina asks innocently.

The reference to my Korean heritage makes my eyes narrow in anger. I'd almost forgotten that the Walgrens like their playthings to be Asian as well as young and female.

""I personally prefer Italian food,"" I respond courteously, ""and I'm no good with chopsticks.""

""That's a pity,"" Gina remarks with a mild sigh, ""I remember the food in Seoul was delicious.""

I consider telling her that I've never been to Korea and don't have any relatives that I know of there, but I decide against it. There's no point in feeding their racist fantasies.

""I think it's time for dessert,"" Steven announces as he stands up, ""but first, those gorgeous little tits of yours are making me hungry for something else.""

I barely have time to get out of my chair before Steven has moved to my side of the table and hauled me over to him. His hands are strong as he runs his fingers over my shoulders and then grabs my b-cups. I squirm as he gropes and fondles them like a teenage boy in a grown man's body while his wife crosses her legs and watches intently.

Gina seems to be loving the show as her husband's hands wander down from my chest across my waist and hips before slipping a hand under my dress. I feel his hand grope my crotch and his fingers slip under the fabric of the thong his wife made me wear, and I squirm even more.

I instinctively try to wriggle out of his grasp, but he holds me in place as he slides his fingers inside me. He can feel how wet my pussy already is, and he clearly loves it. As he tries to worm his fingers about inside me, I manage to free myself from his grasp, and he responds by slapping me. Hot anger burns my cheeks more than his palm does and I slap him back.

Time seems to freeze as the realization of what I've just done hits me harder than my host just did. Gina's eyes have widened in shock and Steven looks stunned that I dared to hit him back. His shock turns to anger and he looms over me with a menacing expression on his face.

My whole body is trembling as I confront this man who can hurt me a lot more than I can hurt him. He flexes his powerful chest, which is so strong that I can see the outline of his pectoral muscles through the fabric of his shirt, and clenches his hands into dangerous fists. I stiffen up and stand my ground, glaring right back at him even as fear paralyzes me.

""I don't care what terms are in that contract."" My voice wavers as I speak, trying and failing to mask my fear with defiance. ""Don't you ever fucking hit me again.""

Steven bears his teeth like an angry wolf and forcibly spins me around. Then he bends me over the table and hikes up the hem of my dress, positioning himself behind me. My hair is sprawled across the dining table and my cheek is pressed against the cold wooden surface, allowing me to look directly at Gina as she pours herself another glass of wine.

""Don't worry, dear Grace,"" Steven assures me menacingly, pulling my hair back, ""I won't slap your pretty face again. I don't need to in order to teach you how to behave like a proper guest.""

He removes his jacket and hangs it on the corner of my chair. I expect to hear him undoing his belt next, but instead I hear a loud smack. The sharp sting of his palm connecting with my butt cheek makes me wince. He pauses for a few seconds before spanking me again, then pauses and does it again, over and over. I grit my teeth and bear it while trying not to look at Gina.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

I'm drenched in sweat and a married man's cum is still leaking out of my pussy. Gina Walgren insists I can't go home until I've had a shower, and because she's just as sweaty as I am, it's a convenient excuse for her to share the shower with me.

I'm relieved that the shower doesn't have enough room for Steven Walgren to join us, so there won't be another threesome today. We leave him in the bedroom to wait for us while Gina tests the temperature of the water before stepping inside, effectively dragging me in with her.

When she closes the shower door, I suddenly feel trapped. I turn around and face the corner of the shower, hugging my chest for comfort while the lukewarm water pours down on my back.

""No need to be shy after that performance,"" Gina taunts me and forces me to turn around.

Mrs. Walgren has no qualms about being naked in front of me, and looking at her body I can see why. She looks like a statue of Venus with her beautifully curved hips and snatched waist. Her breasts are plump and at least a full cup-size larger than mine, and her crotch is crowned with a neatly trimmed bush the same color as her flowing chestnut hair.

In addition to nervous and vulnerable, I actually feel envious.

""Did you have fun today?"" Gina grabs some body lotion and squirts it all over her chest, as if deliberately showing off how her bust is so much bigger than mine.

""It was...fine,"" I answer hesitantly.

""Steven's great in bed, isn't he?"" As Gina lathers the lotion over her body, I get the sense that she's bragging about being married to such a man. If so, she's welcome to keep him.

""I prefer the gentleman I met in the hotel bar.""

""Fair enough.""

Gina continues lathering the lotion all over her gorgeously toned body while I just stand there. Her presence is intimidating and I'm still burning with shame about what I've signed up for so much that I can't bring myself even to fully soak my hair.

Without warning, Gina unhooks the showerhead and sprays me with it.

""Ah! What the fuck?!"" I swat the showerhead away so that it hits the shower wall with a clang.

""Are you're really gonna just stand there until I turn the water off?"" Gina's smirking at me as she squats down to pick the showerhead up again.

""What the hell was that for?!""

""Didn't you shower with other girls when you were in high school?"" Gina asks as she puts the showerhead back in its holder, ""you were so fiery a few minutes ago, and now you're suddenly bashful about being naked with another woman.""

Gina suddenly closes the distance until her busty chest is touching mine and there's nowhere else in the shower to back away from her. I freeze up and stare at her wide-eyed with fear while making a futile attempt to cover my naked body with my hands.

""I am so looking forward to having you back here next Saturday,"" Gina coos to me, her mouth next to my ear as she speaks in an almost sensual whisper, ""and there's really no need for you to be so afraid. There are certain lines Steven's agreed not to cross.""

""Like what?"" I ask with a fearful gulp.

Gina snorts with laughter and pulls away from me. ""You should read the terms of the contract if you want to find out. But don't worry, he's not gonna be

too

rough with you.""

""Do you seriously enjoy watching your husband fuck other women?"" I ask suddenly.

""I do!"" Gina sounds delighted to share this with me, ""Although, even if I didn't, he'd fuck other women anyway. Successful men feel entitled to whatever they want, especially when it comes to pretty things like you. It just so happens that getting to watch turns me on.""

I start scrubbing myself a lot more vigorously. The sooner I'm clean, the sooner I can get out of the shower, get my clothes back on, and get the fuck away from here.

When we're both finished in the shower, Mr. Walgren watches the two of us rub ourselves dry and get dressed. Since he's already put his hands all over my naked body, maintaining some semblance of privacy is pointless. Despite washing and scrubbing myself thoroughly all over, I still feel kind of dirty, and I can still feel his cum leaking out of me.

The week passes in a blur, and before I know it, Saturday morning has arrived and I'm back at the Walgrens' mansion at midday sharp -- just like Gina Walgren told me in her text.

Once again, she's the one to answer the door when I arrive, although this time she's wearing a navy blue dress with a plunging V-neck instead of a bathrobe. She looks me up and down like a cat appraising a mouse, noting my jeans and blouse, before ushering me inside.

""You can call him Steven if you want to,"" Gina answers good-naturedly, ""and he'll be joining us for lunch when he's finished in his office, so there's plenty of time for you to get ready.""

I pause near the top of the steps. ""What, for lunch?"" I sound puzzled as I ask, but that feeling gives way to apprehension almost immediately.

""Don't look so nervous, it's nothing too bad,"" Gina admonishes me with an amused smile, ""and even if it were, you've already signed the contract.""

I grit my teeth and follow Gina towards the master bedroom, my heart pounding and my hands trembling. Having read the contract, there are certain things which it stipulates are off limits in terms of how the Walgrens can treat me, but it's a short list.

The master bedroom is as spacious and immaculate as I remember it. It also brings back some uncomfortable memories of what happened the previous Saturday, but at least Steven Walgren isn't here.

""Why do you think?"" Gina struts over to me until she's almost in my face, looming over me in her high heels. ""Steven wants to see your chest for lunch, so we had this dress made and tailored especially for that, hence why there's no bra.""

""I don't see you being forced to expose yourself,"" I complain.

Gina reaches up to her own cleavage and pulls the parts of her dress covering her breasts apart to either side, casually exposing her much more buxom chest to me. Her shameless -- or perhaps confident -- self-exposure stuns me into silence.

""Does that make you feel better?""

She's mocking me, I'm sure of it. She wants to humiliate me to compensate for the fact that her husband prefers to fuck me rather than her. Why else is she doing this to me?

""Lunch is almost ready,"" Gina informs me as she covers herself up again, ""put your heels on and meet me downstairs in five minutes; and don't forget: you signed the contract.""

***

I arrive in the dining room wearing my breast-baring cocktail dress with my cheeks on fire. The dress also leaves my legs bare with the hem stopping about halfway down my thighs, and the cool air in the dining room causes an outbreak of goosebumps across my exposed skin.

The dining table is circular, and Mr. and Mrs. Walgren are already seated, the former dressed in a business suit with a silver tie. I see the corners of his mouth curl into a smile at the sight of the nervous young Asian woman with her chest exposed for his enjoyment.

""A pleasure to see you again, Ms. Park,"" Steven Walgren greets me.

""Likewise,"" I lie politely as I take my seat.

The food has already been served: Salmon lightly seasoned with salt and lemon with spinach and roast potatoes as well as a glass of red wine next to each of our plates. I'm wary of drinking given my situation, but since I'm being compelled to eat lunch partly naked, I guess it doesn't really make a difference whether my hosts ply me with alcohol.

Steven Walgren's eyes linger on my breasts before Gina taps his hand. The couple raise their glasses and I tentatively follow suit.

""To business and pleasure,"" Steven toasts.

""To business and pleasure,"" Gina repeats.

""May they respect one another's boundaries,"" I quip soberly.

The Walgrens snort with laughter, causing the wine in their glasses to swish dangerously.

""Preferably after enumerating them in the form of a written contract,"" Steven replies.

The couple tap their glasses together with a clink and they each gulp down a mouthful of wine. I take a single cautious sip from my own glass before putting it down carefully.

I almost forget that my boobs are on display as I start eating, and my hosts don't say a word as they tuck into their lunches. I notice Steven Walgren glancing at my chest every minute or so, and instead of feeling self-conscious, I feel a sense of awkward tension knowing he's going to fuck me after lunch while his wife watches.

Gina is just as quiet and composed as her husband, making the fact that they're dining with a topless guest even weirder. She glances at me every few mouthfuls and I do my utmost to avoid making eye contact with her. I also take care not to spill anything on my exposed chest.

As the minutes tick by and we scrape the last of our food off our plates, I reconsider my aversion to the wine. If I'm going to enjoy their hospitality before being used as a sex toy, I may as well avail myself of the alcohol to feel a little better about my situation.

I finish my wine one careful gulp at a time. Having eaten most of my food, the wine will take longer to affect me, but I'm already starting to feel woozy. The wine has a strong fruity taste, and the half-empty bottle sitting on the table tells me it's from the Napa Valley region.

Steven and Gina have already finished eating and are casually sipping the remaining dregs from their glasses. They exchange silent glances as if gossiping telepathically about me while I try to finish my meal. Steven's eyes keep returning to my bare breasts, but by this point I no longer care. He's welcome to leer at me like the pervert he is while his nasty wife watches.

At last, I chew and swallow the last mouthful of food, placing my cutlery together on the plate, and wiping the corner of my mouth. Then I sit there in silence, waiting for what happens next.

""That was delicious,"" Gina says with a beaming smile.

""It was, yes,"" Steven agrees, then turns to me, ""it looks like you enjoyed your lunch, too.""

""I did, thank you."" I'm trying to be polite, but I can tell I'm going to be dessert.

""You don't prefer kimchi or noodles?"" Gina asks innocently.

The reference to my Korean heritage makes my eyes narrow in anger. I'd almost forgotten that the Walgrens like their playthings to be Asian as well as young and female.

""I personally prefer Italian food,"" I respond courteously, ""and I'm no good with chopsticks.""

""That's a pity,"" Gina remarks with a mild sigh, ""I remember the food in Seoul was delicious.""

I consider telling her that I've never been to Korea and don't have any relatives that I know of there, but I decide against it. There's no point in feeding their racist fantasies.

""I think it's time for dessert,"" Steven announces as he stands up, ""but first, those gorgeous little tits of yours are making me hungry for something else.""

I barely have time to get out of my chair before Steven has moved to my side of the table and hauled me over to him. His hands are strong as he runs his fingers over my shoulders and then grabs my b-cups. I squirm as he gropes and fondles them like a teenage boy in a grown man's body while his wife crosses her legs and watches intently.

Gina seems to be loving the show as her husband's hands wander down from my chest across my waist and hips before slipping a hand under my dress. I feel his hand grope my crotch and his fingers slip under the fabric of the thong his wife made me wear, and I squirm even more.

I instinctively try to wriggle out of his grasp, but he holds me in place as he slides his fingers inside me. He can feel how wet my pussy already is, and he clearly loves it. As he tries to worm his fingers about inside me, I manage to free myself from his grasp, and he responds by slapping me. Hot anger burns my cheeks more than his palm does and I slap him back.

Time seems to freeze as the realization of what I've just done hits me harder than my host just did. Gina's eyes have widened in shock and Steven looks stunned that I dared to hit him back. His shock turns to anger and he looms over me with a menacing expression on his face.

My whole body is trembling as I confront this man who can hurt me a lot more than I can hurt him. He flexes his powerful chest, which is so strong that I can see the outline of his pectoral muscles through the fabric of his shirt, and clenches his hands into dangerous fists. I stiffen up and stand my ground, glaring right back at him even as fear paralyzes me.

""I don't care what terms are in that contract."" My voice wavers as I speak, trying and failing to mask my fear with defiance. ""Don't you ever fucking hit me again.""

Steven bears his teeth like an angry wolf and forcibly spins me around. Then he bends me over the table and hikes up the hem of my dress, positioning himself behind me. My hair is sprawled across the dining table and my cheek is pressed against the cold wooden surface, allowing me to look directly at Gina as she pours herself another glass of wine.

""Don't worry, dear Grace,"" Steven assures me menacingly, pulling my hair back, ""I won't slap your pretty face again. I don't need to in order to teach you how to behave like a proper guest.""

He removes his jacket and hangs it on the corner of my chair. I expect to hear him undoing his belt next, but instead I hear a loud smack. The sharp sting of his palm connecting with my butt cheek makes me wince. He pauses for a few seconds before spanking me again, then pauses and does it again, over and over. I grit my teeth and bear it while trying not to look at Gina.",,2025-08-15T19:08:48.973154,3709,2.0

A CHANGE FOR GOOD

I was running late because of the boys. We'd had a squabble in the car, then another one at my parents, then finally I'd been able to get them settled. I had to talk to Dad about it, about the friction between them, which had cost me more time. It hadn't helped that James was running late too, caught up in some meeting in the city, leaving me to fend on my own. I shot Fee a quick message, but got no reply.

I pulled up outside Barton and Fee's house twenty minutes late, tugging my dress into place and running a hand through my hair. I'd had to do my make-up in the car, so it wasn't perfect but it would have to do. At the gate I had a little moment of panic, painfully aware of the dreadful burden locked over my crotch. Two months now, and no end in sight. I'd met with Jodie five times, organising bookings for James or dropping back her share of the proceeds, and she had shown no inclination to release me.

Our last meeting had rankled particularly: I'd gotten around to the subject of my chastity belt, my eyes on the thin chain around her neck, the keys tucked safely in her cleavage. She'd just asked me if I was going to be a good girl, waiting patiently until I'd nodded. Giving her that, admitting the effect that the denial was having on me, the control she had over my body, it had been absolutely humiliating. She'd noticed it, then casually leaned across the table, smiled, and observed that I seemed to be enjoying the humiliation. She'd just gotten up and walked away, leaving me there at the table, burning with shame, feeling once again that dire, endless need between my legs.

It seemed to permeate everything. The boys arguing tonight, the way they responded to the general mood of the house, the look on my husband's face when he told me he needed to take a meeting in the city, it all told me something, holding up a mirror to my own disposition. The belt was having its effect, starving me of release but reminding me constantly of its presence, driving me to distraction. I needed release; I had a suspicion that Jodie was counting on it, that there would be a day in the near future that she would dangle it in front of me with a set of degrading conditions. I was getting closer and closer to the day that I'd say yes. I was getting closer and closer to agreeing to anything.

Fee opened the door and gave me a kiss on the cheek, escorting me through the house to the entertaining room at the back. Barton was in one of the armchairs with a whiskey set on a side table. He smiled at me as I entered.

""I won't get up,"" he called, ""But, good of you to make it.""

""Sorry,"" I stammered, ""It was just a nightmare tonight. Logistics.""

""Not a problem,"" he smiled back at me as I approached, ""You're not on the clock. Fee, would you be able to get Alice a drink?""

""Usual, Alice?"" she called out as she went over to the drinks tray, ""Or bubbles?""

""I'm driving, maybe just a glass.""

""Very sensible.""

Barton indicated the couch and I sank down into the upholstery with a sense of relief.

""Bad day?"" he enquired.

""Yeah.""

""In general? Or the belt?""

I'd told them about the belt a few weeks back, lifting my skirt to show him. We'd started seeing each other socially, as couples, and despite my initial reservations about Fee, I'd found her to be funny and quick-witted, Barton to be whip-smart and effortlessly charming. James and I had talked long into the night about it and decided that we could move past the fact that they had bought our services, entering into a much more nuanced relationship with this odd couple, one that didn't involve payment but that did still involve sex.

It had troubled me, watching James with Fee that first time, having had the choice rather than it being a booking. It was something just between the four of us, a little help for us all in our current situations. I didn't tell James the other part of it; I kept my little secret to myself, pretending to James that I wanted him to be able to satisfy himself fully even as I was unable to because of the belt. I'd pretended to him that Barton and I had a similar issue and this was just something that made sense, allowing our other halves the release that we couldn't provide.

There was something else though, something that tugged at me deep inside. I loved watching James fuck her. I was mesmerised by his body, the way it flexed as he drove into the younger blonde woman. It gave me such a desperate thrill, a heat between my legs, to witness my man in action, to see the way that Fee's eyes fixed on him as she experienced the full force of his ardent attentions. I shuddered in vicarious passion as their bodies combined.

Fee brought two flutes of champagne over, handing me one. I took a sip.

""On the subject of the belt, do you mind if I take a closer look?"" Barton enquired.

""Uh, really?""

""Yes. It's been on my mind.""

""You mean, right now?""

""Might as well.""

He indicated for me to stand in front of him. I hesitated for a moment.

""Seriously, I'm a doctor,"" Barton laughed, ""I guarantee I've seen it all.""

I got up and positioned myself in front of him. Nervously, I took another mouthful of the champagne.

""Facing away, please, and raise your dress. Fee, I'll need some light. Could you?""

I turned away from him and began to raise the hem of my dress until I'd exposed my bottom to him. I felt naked and vulnerable, feeling his eyes on my body, the little familiar tug of humiliation kindling something inside me.

""The light,"" Barton remarked, ""Just there.""

I felt a little pressure at the top of my buttocks, where the straps locked together. Fee got out her phone and turned on the torch, shining it across my rear.

""Topless.""

I frowned, unsure of the instruction, but Fee was already in motion, sliding down the straps of her dress, baring her breasts for her husband.

""Good girl, much better. Just hold steady.""

""What are you doing?"" I asked, nervously, feeling his fingers tugging the straps.

""The same, don't you think?"" Barton mused, ignoring me.

""Identical,"" Fee agreed.

""What?"" I repeated.

Barton patted me on the bottom and then pulled my dress down.

""You can sit down again, Alice.""

I straightened up, feeling suddenly woozy.

""Steady on,"" Barton cautioned.

I felt Fee's hand around my arm, guiding me back to the couch.

""Sorry,"" I muttered, ""I just feel a little light-headed.""

I slumped down onto the upholstery and Fee took up position next to me. For some reason, it didn't seem at all odd that she was topless. Her expression changed, breaking out into an odd, unsettling smile.

""I... I must have stood up too quickly. My head's spinning,"" I stammered.

""Oh Alice, that's because I've drugged you,"" Fee replied.

I looked from the half-full glass of champagne in my hand to Fee's smiling face.

""You... you did what?""

Barton leaned towards me, saying, ""My friend was able to analyse it. It's a powerful dissociative tranquiliser, quite unlike anything he's seen before. It must be brand new on the market. I have to say that the effects are fascinating to observe up close. Such a rapid onset.""

I tried to get up, but Fee put her hand on my shoulder, keeping me in place.

""Shush, it's okay, you don't need to worry about it,"" Fee told me, prising the glass gently from my fingers and setting it down on the table.

I blinked furiously, but I could feel the fog descending. It felt just like the first time, at Delilah's house, like someone was filling my head with cotton wool.

""I have someone waiting in the next room. You're going to come with me and meet him. He's been looking forward to this all night.""

""Wait, no,"" I gasped, shaking my head, ""James.""

""Oh, don't worry about James. You don't need to worry at all. You're going to enjoy this.""

I could feel her words, how they were slipping past my crumbling defences, a part of me happy to take her at her word. She was smiling at me so sweetly, how could I not trust her? Fee had told me I was going to like meeting this man. I shook my head again, trying to counter the effects of the drug, but it was futile. When Fee took my hand and stood up, I rose smoothly from the couch and allowed myself to be led away.

We passed through another door into a darkened hallway. The house seemed to be endless.

""You might as well strip off the dress,"" Fee told me over her shoulder.

It did seem like the right thing to do. I pulled my dress up, getting it stuck around my waist.

""Oh, hold on. Let me.""

Fee stopped and unzipped the back of my dress, helping me out of it. She made short work of my bra too, leaving me bare except for my high heels and the chastity belt secured over my crotch.

""Much better,"" she smiled, ""Come on, he's waiting for you.""

She took me by the hand and we were moving again.

""Why?"" I mumbled.

""Why what, Alice?""

""This,"" I struggled, ""Why this? Why are you doing this?""

""Because you earned it,"" Fee chuckled, ""You've been so good.""

The words, the intonation, the little sly smile as she said them, made my blood run cold. She sounded just like Jodie.

""James let something slip. Tell me, Alice, when you drug your husband, how do you feel?""

Fee's eyes narrowed, watching me. I struggled to form my thoughts.

""Awful,"" I confessed, ""Such... such a bad wife.""

""Why, Alice?""

I sighed sadly. She might as well hear it.

""I drug him and then I let strangers use him.""

I felt the familiar knot in my guts, but the hard edge had been removed by the drug. It made the guilt bearable, as if it was all something that happened to someone else in a story I'd heard. Turning the man I loved into some woman's fuck toy by feeding him a little coloured square of paper, all so that he'd be able to perform for our client, it had been eating me away inside. That, and the constant low-level ache of chastity, had been wearing me down, making my life miserable. I sighed again. It all felt like just too much to deal with.

""Here we are,"" Fee announced.

""What... what's going to happen?""

We had arrived at a set of double doors, and I peered at them dubiously through the gloom.

""He's waiting,"" Fee whispered, ""And he's going to have such fun with you. Tonight you see the other side, Alice. Tonight it happens to you.""

I blinked at her again, but it was too dark to read her expression. All I could see was her smile and her eyes glittering in the dark. We'd been wrong about these people, I realised, my mind turning over sluggishly now as the drug took hold of me. We'd trusted them, giving them all the details we had. I'd even given them a sample of the drug.

I blinked again, trying to recall that memory. I'd handed the little square of coloured paper over to Fee in the carpark, underground, beyond phone signal. We'd cut a slice off it beforehand to keep in case James had needed it for our next booking, but we'd given the rest to the woman in front of me, the woman married to a brilliant, eccentric paraplegic neurosurgeon who thought nothing of hiring someone to give his wife a good, hard fucking. We'd fallen in with them, believing they were on our side.

Now, here I was, dosed with the same drug I'd blithely handed over to them, stripped naked by Fee, helpless, waiting to meet the man they'd given me to. I turned to Fee, screwing up the very last of my ebbing willpower to defy her, but she just held a finger to my lips, waiting until the last of my resistance leached from me.

""Good girl. Now, open the door and go in.""

My hands obeyed, clutching the handles. I willed them to obey me instead, but they pushed forwards and the doors swung open to reveal a boudoir.

""Go in.""

I took it all in: the bed, the little reading lamp that cast a pool of illumination in the darkened room, a chest of drawers, curtains drawn over a window, and then the shape of a man in the corner of the room, approaching me.

""Please, no,"" I whispered, ""Please.""

He reached out, brushing his hand across my cheek, turning my head before I could look at him. I wanted to turn back, to fix his face in my memory. I needed to concentrate, I needed to find a way out, but the drugs were flowing through me now, dampening the urge to flee, making the idea of struggling seem like too much effort. Better to just go along with it, to be a pawn in their games.

I felt a tug on the back of the chastity belt and my heart soared. Of course, they hadn't been able to solve that problem. They'd given me to this stranger, but I was still locked up tight. Only Jodie had the key, I was safe.

There was a click, and the belt fell away, leaving my crotch free for the first time in two months. My heart froze, the last vestiges of my thoughts overwhelmed by the implications. They were all in it together. That's how Jodie had known everything. We'd revealed all our plans to our enemies. I started to sob.

Large hands seized me, turning me around, pushing me down onto the bed. I saw his face.

""James,"" I gasped.

""Alice.""

He leaned towards me, entering the little pool of light, and I recognised my husband's face. He regarded me silently for a moment and then smiled.

""I... I don't...,"" was all I could manage.

James held the key up, and beckoned Fee over. I blinked away my tears, unable to comprehend how my husband was involved in all this, how he had the key to the belt that had been imprisoning my sex for weeks.

""I'll let James tell you about the drug. I'll leave you to it,"" Fee said, ""I imagine you have lost time to make up.""

I looked up into my husband's face, caught in the endless grey of his eyes.

""I asked her to drug you,"" he confessed.

""Why?""

""You tortured yourself giving it to me, every time. I could see what it was doing to you, but you don't need to feel guilty Alice. You take such good care of me. I wanted you to understand how it feels from the other side.""

Silently, James undressed. He pushed me back onto the bed and climbed on top of me, straddling me on hands and knees, running his fingertips over my throat and between my bare breasts.

""Feel how it burns.""

My eyes flared in surprise, my skin heating beneath his touch as his fingers traced down my stomach towards my bare, open crotch.

""Feel the pleasure.""

He began to circle my entrance with a fingertip and my body surged, my back arching, lifting my mons to meet him as an incredible thrill passed through me, as if his fingers were electric.

""I wanted you to feel how I felt, Alice. How your touch felt to me when you took me in your arms after I was done, how you took care of me when I couldn't take care of myself. This is what it does, you see? I suggest and you feel, everything magnified.""

With exquisite care, he spread my labia and dipped his fingertip into my moistness. I shuddered violently, arching in bliss, trying to brace myself for the inevitable moment when....

He pressed my nub, grazing it with a fingernail, and I came, spasming violently, feeling moistness gushing from me to cover his hand. He flicked me and I came again, blanking out for a moment, my body quivering with aftershocks.

""All that time without, and now you're completely out of control. Would you like more?""

""Nnnnhh....""

It was the only sound I could make. James took it as acceptance and grazed my clit a third time, the orgasm sending sparks across my vision, my body taut as the ecstasy washed over me.

""Enough for now,"" he whispered, and I felt his lips against my open mouth, ""Just relax and enjoy. No need to cum anymore until I tell you.""

My body lay helpless, boneless on the bed. Between the drugs, the intense afterglow of my shocking climaxes, and the unbearable elation of finally being free to receive my husband, I didn't want to move. I just wanted to feel him slide into me.

""I've been waiting for this.""

I felt a slight pressure between my legs, spreading me wide, and then a filling sensation. My head stirred weakly, looking down my body to see my husband's rigid manhood disappearing inside me. He started to move forward and back, repeating each languorous cycle as my body responded to him.

""Don't cum.""

I nodded, hoping my body had received the instruction. James began to increase the pace steadily, building up his tempo until I could feel his tip pushing against my cervix. He felt like a steel rod, and I found myself contracting around him every time he withdrew, savouring every last crumb of the friction of his erection against my inner sanctum. My tension built, and he began to thrust harder, plunging deep inside, picking up the pace.

""Don't cum,"" he grunted through clenched teeth.

My body obeyed, even as I felt the familiar, delicious tightness in my core as another orgasm approached. James kept up his rhythm, merciless, unstoppable, leaving me no choice but to receive him inside me. There was a soft mewling sound in my ears and I realised that it was coming from me.

""You're so beautiful, Alice. I love you so much.""

I blinked and felt the trickle of warm water run down the sides of my face. I closed my eyes instead, letting the tears flow as I rode the waves of bliss, rising up to my climax, losing track of time.

""So beautiful.""

James held me there, way past the point that I was able to understand the things he was saying anymore, past the point that my body began to burn for orgasm, past the point of thinking at all. I was grinning like a lunatic, crying at the same time, and all the while stealing tiny little breaths as he pounded into me.

I didn't come; my body was waiting, lifted to a plateau beyond orgasm, a place that I felt I could wait forever for James to reach his own peak. He was controlling himself, slowing the pace, taking a breath, going harder again, teasing himself, enjoying me completely. I parted my lips, but no words came out. I swallowed hard, feeling my mouth dry.

""Take me,"" I rasped.

I was aware of a change in him, a rumbling in the distance, hot breath against my neck and the ceaseless pressure of him between my legs. I let myself go, feeling my body shaking under his animal onslaught. My eyes drifted open, rewarded with the sight of James thrusting into me, his bare body rippling, slick with sweat. I had seen him from afar, taking other women, and now he was pistoning into me, my dearest fantasy fulfilled.

I registered dark, grunting noises and felt a quiver pass through him. I constricted around him, unconsciously, my body obeying the command from his, squeezing him hard as he began to twitch and shiver. There was a kick, deep inside me, and then I could feel him filling me with his seed. I came violently, abandoning myself to a shattering orgasm, the world fading to white.

---

Fee handed me a glass of water and I took it gratefully.

""Thanks,"" I mumbled.

""How you feeling?"" she asked.

""Shattered.""

""Yeah, he really took it out of you, huh? We could hear you clear across the house.""

I sipped the cold water, feeling the aching in my limbs. The fog inside my head had lifted, at least enough to hold normal conversation.

""James reckoned about half of what was left on the paper would be enough, just to tip you over the edge for a while. I guess there are after-effects though.""

I shook my head slowly, replying, ""Not really. I think it's more the, uh, the physical side, after being locked up so long. I don't get it though, where did you get the key from?""",,2025-08-15T19:09:24.441029,3647,
https://www.literotica.com/s/trophies-ch-04,Trophies Ch. 04,Unknown Author,,,,,"Ed took a moment to gather himself. With the slightest miscalculation, Roger could have frozen Karla and there would have been no telling the damage he could have done. But now Ed had the little bugger right where he wanted him. He put the frozen Roger on the floor and had Karla pin him with her body with clear instructions to keep him down at all costs. As an additional precaution, Ed stepped back to create distance between them. When he felt there was enough room to safely react, he unfroze the college kid.

""You little shit. This is exactly why I didn't trust you. Freezing random civilians. How did you think that was going to play out?"" Ed asked. ""Even if I didn't catch you, someone would have.""

""Fuck you."" Roger said.

""Which of these people are aware and which are unaware? You tell me that and I'll let you go.""

""You think I'm stupid, man. Like hell you're going to let me go."" Roger said.

""You can make this easier on yourself if you just tell me who's aware that they are frozen.""

It made a huge difference to know who was aware and who was unaware. Unaware people were not a problem. They could just be returned to their original position and unfrozen. They would have no memory of being frozen and being used by Roger. The aware ones were the problem. Once unfrozen, they would remember everything done to them and they would remember seeing Roger, Ed, and Karla. That would make them the three prime suspects right off the bat. Surely Roger couldn't be that stupid. However, his choice of venue already revealed how little he had thought things through.

""You've got one last chance.""

""Or you'll what?""

Ed froze Roger again. He had Karla stand against the wall and then froze her too. It wasn't ideal, but if Roger wasn't going to voluntarily give up information, then Ed was going to command it out of him. Ed took the mind-controlling Kollar watch off of Karla and put it on Roger. Once Roger was set up in the App, Ed could safely unfreeze him. It was weird seeing a blank man responding the same way he had already seen his wife, his daughter and the twins respond. The only change Ed made was that Roger had to answer all questions with the truth.

""Roger, since you've had the camera, who did you freeze that is aware?""

Ed remained on edge. Despite having control of Roger, the kid could be faking it and pounce at any moment. But he stood still, and his blank monotone voice filled the room.

""The daughter of your boss, Cali, the store owner, my mother, and my sister.""

""Everyone else is unaware?""

""Yes.""

Ed froze Roger again immediately, fearing he was faking it. For good measure, Ed slapped Roger and was finally at ease when there was no reaction or retaliation. With all the damage done so far, he couldn't afford any more mistakes. Ed took the watch off Roger and put it back on Karla to make her help. Until Ed had more devices, he couldn't leave any witnesses. Unfortunately, that meant taking his boss, Olivia, and her daughter, Megan, with him. He could just take Megan but, having her mother on the loose looking for her was going to cause way more problems. At least with both of them, he could buy some time. There was also Roger's sister and mother which he had to admit, made damn fine trophies. Until he probed all their memories, it was best to play it on the safe side.

For a short time, Ed was going to realize his dream of owning a collection of trophies until he found new devices or had time to erase the memories of Roger's freezing joyride. With his plan set, there was only one person left to deal with. The frozen store owner, Cali, was in the same place that Roger had left her. Ed had seen her many times before with his brother Michael's fiancé, Samantha and from his understanding, they were close friends.

Without hesitation, Ed unfroze her. Cali gathered her senses and then charged for the camera, but Ed froze her in place again.

""Look. I'm Michael's brother. Samantha's Michael. My daughter's stupid boyfriend stole this from my office after I agreed to help Michael test it. I didn't mean for this to happen, but that idiot is frozen now. All I want to do is chat.""

Ed waited a moment and unfroze Cali again. She didn't attack this time.

""You're Mike's brother."" Cali said.

""Yes. My name is Ed.""

""Well Ed, there are multiple people frozen in here. I don't think you realize how serious this is.""

""All of them are unaware except for one.""

""Unaware?""

""Yes, there is a prototype unaware camera. That's what I was testing. So as long as we put them back in certain places before we unfreeze them, everything will be fine."" Ed said.

""And what about the one who is aware?""

""Well, we can hope that little punk did nothing to her."" Ed paused to ponder how much detail he should give away. Maybe less was better. ""Or I can take her back home and use another device that Michael has to erase anything.""

""Hold up. You're going to erase her memory?""

Or maybe the truth was the best way to go to provide clarity.

""When I said 'hope nothing happened', I already know something did. You can go ahead and unfreeze her, but there's going to be a sexual lawsuit against the guy and this store coming right after.""

Cali took a moment to think. The way Ed painted the picture, he hoped she saw it as a problem not worth having.

""And you're sure only that one person was aware?""

""Besides you. Yes.""

Cali looked in the first two changing rooms and saw the various women frozen. It was enough of a mess to deal with on its own, but Ed was hoping that the women having no recollection would relieve Cali enough to not worry about the one aware girl.

""If any of those women says anything, I will report it to the police immediately. Do you understand?"" Cali said.

Ed nodded.

""You take care of that one person, and I will deal with the rest.""

""Thank you, Cali. My daughter and I will help you and then unfreeze them when you are ready.""

""You're lucky you are Michael's brother."" Cali said and then disappeared into the first stall.

While Cali was busy moving women back into the store, Ed drove his truck around to the back area and stealthily hauled out the frozen Roger, Megan and Olivia. Cali was too distracted with her own problem to notice that Ed had taken two women and not one. Afterward, Ed and Karla helped Cali set everything back to normal before unfreezing the group of women. There was confusion initially, as expected, but Cali was in the vicinity of everyone acting natural, so they resumed their normal shopping. The time loss was the only real issue, but even then, it was less than an hour. The rationale of losing time while shopping would work to their favor.

Ed and Karla left with their new set of trophies and a new set of problems to deal with, hoping to never hear from Cali again.

**

The garage door opened, and Ed pulled in, happy to have something that kept his business away from neighbor's prying eyes. In the kitchen he was unexpectedly greeted by his wife, Kendra. He had assumed she would be frozen by her control watch in his man cave.

""Hello honey.""

""Kendra. What are you doing up here?""

""We kind of got a problem downstairs.""

That weaselly lawyer just couldn't leave them alone. Ed instructed Karla to wait for him before hauling anyone in from the truck. To Ed's utter dismay, in the man cave was a tied-up police officer who was very much awake. It was the same police officer that had interrupted his dinner. After making eye contact, there was no plausible deniability now.

""Shit."" Ed muttered under his breath.

Ed confronted Kendra on what had happened and was relieved to hear how his wife had reacted. Having the cop escape would have been far worse. But now his trophy problem just got larger. Out of precaution, Ed froze the cop and then helped Karla haul in the 5 new trophies, which included Roger's mother and sister. With everyone frozen and accounted for, before Ed dealt with the serious matters, it was time to have some fun at the expense of the man whom Ed had graciously let fuck his wife. What was life without a little friendly revenge?

The marker was tough to get off, but Ellie did her best to scrub her body clean from the night at Decor. It wasn't like she could walk around with vulgar words on her face, and it was also preventing her from posting anything on her social media. In this day and age, she had to post every day to stay on her fan's radar or she risked losing followers.

Once she was out of the shower, Ellie grabbed her phone and immediately went to Niki's page. There was nothing there. Probably because Niki had to keep up the charade that she was Ellie. As soon as she posted to her own page, the con was done.

The only way Ellie would ever know what went on that night after her sister and Ellie's boyfriend left Décor was through Mac or Niki themselves. It was time to give her sister a piece of her mind. Ellie barged into Niki's room and saw her identical twin fresh out of the shower with a babushka on her head while sitting at her desk and texting.

""You bitch."" Ellie said from the door.

Niki ignored her and continued texting.

""Are you seriously going to ignore me now?"" Ellie said. She marched over to her sister and before she saw it, it was too late to retreat.

Niki stood up with the Décor camera in hand and smiled at her now frozen sister. Much like the night before, Ellie was completely unable to move but still aware of everything going on.

""Men are so stupid. One flash of my tits and one of the hosts was happy to part with the camera."" Niki said. ""This is going to be so much fun.""

Niki posed Ellie so she was stand straight with a blank face. All Ellie could do was watch in the mirror as her sister did whatever she wanted to her once again. Niki stepped back.

""I've always wanted something like a live mirror. For example."" Niki grabbed a tube of lip gloss from her vanity table. ""Let's see how this lip gloss looks on me.""

Niki put the lip gloss on Ellie and stood back. She wasn't too thrilled with the color and wiped it off. For the next hour, Ellie remained frozen while her sister tried different make-up and outfits on her. She was a carbon copy of Niki, giving her sister a 360 view of how anything would look like on her. Niki finally settled on an outfit.

""God this is so much more fun than trying to angle my body with mirrors."" Niki said. ""I am so fucking hot.""

Ellie took it as a compliment and agreed. But now her sister was using her like an object instead of treating her like a sister.

""Anyway, I'm going on another date with Mac as you. When I get back here with him, I'm going to need you to be hidden."" Niki looked around her room. ""Where could I put you?""

The frozen bliss had taken hold and Ellie was trying to remain alert and not be distracted by the pleasure building below. By the time Niki returned from her hiding place hunt, Ellie had orgasmed and her mind refocused on her sister prancing around and impersonating her life.

""You know what, I think just putting you in the corner like a frozen, naked statue would do the trick. Let's be honest, we're too pretty to just hide away.""

And so Ellie was moved to the corner and posed in an erotic position. Niki spread her sister's legs and arched her back so that she leaned forward. Guiding Ellie's right arm, she snuggled it under her twin's tits and brought the left hand to delicately touch her cheek. With her makeup done up, she must have made a beautiful statue. Niki added heels and some gold rings, necklaces and bracelets to further accentuate Ellie's beauty.

""Since you're playing me, I really need to play up your beauty."" Niki said. ""Because while he's with the real Niki, he won't be able to take his eyes off the fake Niki. That's like a double Niki boner.""

Niki couldn't wipe the grin off her face, either from her joke or from how everything was going her way. When she was happy with her creation, Niki continued getting ready and Ellie stood beautifully and helplessly by like a collector's piece in her sister's bedroom.

Eventually Niki left and Ellie was left in the darkness of her sister's room. Once again, Niki was going to have fun and Ellie was stuck like a statue. The frozen bliss took over and Ellie rode the pleasure hoping it would distract her from her current predicament.

Ed waited in his office with Roger frozen in a chair beside the bookshelf near the door. It was a shame that Ed didn't have more devices to have fun with, but it was a problem he planned on solving soon. Roger's sister, still dressed as Wonder Woman, burst through the door and then stood with her hands on her hips in the classic superheroine pose.

""Your reign of terror is over Doctor Hypnosis. Now let my friends go!"" Her voice was intentionally made as campy as the television program was. It had been one of Ed's favorite shows growing up, especially with the different mind control aspects it occasionally portrayed.

Ed stood up and matched her performance with his own over-the-top theatrics.

""You'll never stop me Wonder Woman. I have your lover right where I want him. And now I have you."" Ed said, adding an evil laugh to further dive into his fantasy.

Wonder Woman looked to her right and saw Roger 'tied-up'. In reality, he was actually sitting in a chair frozen and without restraints. As punishment, Ed had made sure he was aware of everything that was happening. Roger's sister rushed over and gave him a big, long kiss that only lovers would do.

""Babe, I'm here to save you."" she said as she broke the kiss. But her lover didn't move. The superheroine turned her attention back to Ed.

""What did you do to him?"" Wonder Woman demanded.

""The same thing I am going to do to you.""

Wonder woman ran at him but stopped in her tracks at the sight of a diamond pendant. Ed swung it back and forth, enthralling the beautiful amazon warrior. Her eyes followed the swing, mesmerized by it. Controlled by it. Entranced by it. Of course, it wasn't the pendant doing the mind controlling, but from the outsider perspective and like the television show depicted, it was hard to tell the difference. For having not acted before, the Kollar watch was certainly making Roger's sister, Diane, give an incredible performance.

""That's right Wonder Woman, fall under my spell.""

""No, I must resist.""

""But you can't. No one resists Doctor Hypnosis."" Ed said in a campy voice.

Wonder Woman's eyes fluttered as they darted back and forth until they finally rolled back into her head. Acting and mind control aside, the girl was a perfect hypnosis subject with the way she responded and Ed was already hard from the encounter before he even saw what was underneath her costume.

""That's right my slave. Completely under my control."" Ed said. He stopped swinging the watch and wrapped the chain up before pocketing it. Snapping his fingers, Wonder Woman's eyes returned to normal.

""What did you do to me?"" She asked trying to move, but only her eyes and mouth could.

""Like your lover, I have enslaved you. Now you will do my bidding!""

""No, I must... fight..."" She tried and tried, but the effort was futile.

Ed walked over and pulled down her top while staring into her gorgeous blue eyes.

""First you're going to worship my cock, and then I'm going fuck you in front of your lover."" Ed said as he tucked a piece of jet-black hair behind her ear. ""And then I am going to do what none of your other adversaries have done. I'm going to add you to my collection.""

Wonder Woman struggled to get free. Ed pushed her to her knees and pulled out his already erect cock.

""Isn't it beautiful?""

""Please Doctor Hypnosis. Please let me go. I will stay out of your way. The city is yours.""

""When I snap my fingers, your only desire in life will be the cock in front of you.""

""No.""

Snap!

Her facial reaction still reflected how she felt inside, but she moved forward and engulfed his cock like it was the best thing in the world. Occasionally her eyes wondered up to meet his and through the desire, he could see the superheroine trying to resist. But she would never break the technology wrapped around her wrist.

Ed looked over at Roger, who was now subjected to watching his sister blow and fuck the man he had tried to screw over. It was a bittersweet moment and Ed had one more surprise planned for his captive. Once Ed was ready to blow, he moved Wonder Woman's head off his cock, aimed and exploded onto her face, hitting her in the left eye, forehead and lips.

Ed then ripped open a hole in her costume and the cum covered superheroine was bent over Roger's seat. With her hands holding the arms of the chair and her head pulled back so she could make eye contact with Roger, Ed entered her from behind. With only the sound of his cock stretching her pussy and his pelvis slamming into her behind, Ed decided to liven it up by ordering Wonder Woman to happily cheer him on while he fucked her 'powers' away.

""Oh yes, make Wonder Woman your little bitch. Fuck this super pussy."" Wonder Woman' screamed in between moans of pleasure. ""I'm so weak for your cock. Take my powers away, I don't deserve them.""

It was like being at the end of an episode, except this time, the villain was going to win. His cock was draining her of her powers, and she was completely under his control. Ed grabbed a hold of her long black hair and pulled it back without any regard for her comfort. He fucked her like the whore that she was. The sight of the iconic uniform and Diane's struggle to cheer while being manhandled made Ed lose control and he came inside her. At the same time, she climaxed, but before she could finish, Ed instructed her to freeze, and the room went silent.

Ed walked around and was delighted to see that Wonder Woman was frozen in the middle of her orgasm so that her 'O' face was on display for both himself and Roger to see. The one eye that wasn't covered in cum was also closed. Her eyebrows were raised, and her mouth was open fully with a slight smile as a result of the pleasure that had coursed through her body.

Initially, Ed had intended to clean her up and put her on display like the episode ""Art of Crime,"" but the statue before him was so much more degrading and appropriate. Her cum-covered 'O' face, disheveled hair and leaking pussy while she remained inches away from her brother's face, was exactly what Roger needed to remind him of his mistake of fucking with Ed.

Ed slapped Roger on the shoulder while he admired the view.

""Your sister is one hell of a fuck.""

After taunting Roger a bit more, Ed froze Diane with the camera and took off her watch. He placed the watch on Roger and instructed to him to remain frozen. Ed then brought in Roger's mother, stilled dressed in a princess Leia slave bikini, and laid her on the couch like a frozen sex doll.

""Now here's the deal, Roger. I know you're a horn dog. I let you have my wife and you always wanted more. So, what I am going to do is turn your sex drive way up and not allow you to leave this room."" Ed said. ""You've got one gently used sex doll and one brand new one on the couch. You don't have to, but if the urge is too strong, don't say I never did anything for you.""

Roger remained still. Ed planned on giving him free autonomy, with a few restrictions, so he wanted to be out of the room when the boy came to life. Ed closed the door and locked it. The room was on the second floor and although Roger was instructed through the app not to leave the room, it gave Ed comfort knowing that if Roger somehow bypassed that, he wouldn't risk jumping out of a two-story window. All he could do was satisfy his sexual drive either through masturbating or by fucking. The choice was up to him really. Ed activated Roger's watch and walked away, leaving Roger to his own devices.

**

Once Roger felt control return, he pushed past his sister and ran after Ed. But he was too late as the large wooden door closed in his face.",,2025-08-15T19:09:29.943533,3659,
https://www.literotica.com/s/not-that-kind-of-girl-2,Not That Kind of Girl,Unknown Author,,,,,"Daniel kept his left hand in his pocket while the woman standing next to him at the coffee shop flirted with him. A cute brunette, she definitely seemed interested in him, following him over to a ledge by the wall, trying to keep conversation going.

Still unsure whether she'd be the kind to hook up with a married man or not, he slipped his ring off, picked up his coffee cup and held it to her like he was clinking a wine glass for celebratory drinks. Her green eyes immediately fell to there and she smiled.

These ones were always trickier. Some women preferred married men, while others saw themselves as 'not that kind of girl'. However, several of those in his experience did turn out to be that kind, without much convincing. She gave her name, Kate, and he offered her his business card, saying to call him any time. Unfortunately, he had a meeting to get to and had to cut it short. For now.

He didn't really have a meeting, but this was the way he hooked them. Always leave them wanting more, was the game he'd honed over the past year or so.

Two days later, she called and asked if he'd like to meet up with her after work for a drink. Right after, he called his wife, telling her he had to stay late. A last-minute project for a major client had come up.

Kate was waiting by the bar of the Xray lounge. He could tell right then she was used to being single, keeping close to the staff in case she needed help fending off some weirdo. Even a trendy, high end wine bar like this got its share. Dressed in a blue minidress that hugged her curves, she smiled shyly the moment she caught sight of him. He guessed she was twenty-three at most. Her body was still tight and hard, her breasts, small and pert.

He kissed her cheek, brushing the corner of her mouth, and took the seat next to her. The sooner he played up anything sexual with a new conquest, the sooner the real stuff would happen.

They chatted over apple martinis and he learned she worked in marketing. She'd been hired straight from an internship and was new to the city. She talked mostly about herself, which suited him just fine. Less of a chance anything awkward like mention of a wife would come up. A few hours later, he said he had to go - an early day tomorrow - and offered to drive her home.

She followed him to his car. Never yet had a woman told him she'd rather drive herself, walk or call a taxi instead. While she directed him to her place, he occasionally rested his hand on her knee, or brushed against her thigh whenever he shifted gears. Each time any part of their bodies made contact, she flashed him an awkward smile.

Outside the low-rise condo building, he pulled to a stop and parked under a tree that sheltered them from the glare of an overhead streetlight. She made no move to exit, another good sign.

""I had a wonderful time tonight,"" he said, putting his hand to the crook of her neck and bringing her face closer to his. Not a twitch of resistance. He pressed his mouth to hers, parting her lips with his tongue. For several minutes they kissed passionately and he placed his hand more firmly on her thigh. His fingers inched up underneath the hem of her dress.

They kissed like teenagers, frenzied and excited. Her knees fell apart and he began stroking the flimsy fabric shielding her pussy. It was damp. He slipped his fingers underneath and rubbed her inner labia, then stuck two up inside of her, fucking her with them.

Suddenly she sat upright, eyes downcast. He apologised to her, telling her how beautiful she was, and that he would never push her to where she was uncomfortable. In that moment, he could tell. It had been a while for her. She was desperate to be touched, but she was not that kind of girl, not the kind who would sleep with a man she'd just met. They kissed once more and she asked what he was doing this coming weekend.

""Out of town,"" he told her, visiting his mom. Another excuse that always worked. They agreed to meet up the following Tuesday, kissed once more, and she got out of the car.

For their next date, he picked her up after work and they hung out for an hour or so at a quiet spot called The Blue Room. Tonight, he kept it to hand-holding and a little kissing. When he said he had to go, she asked if he was free this coming Saturday.

Later that night, he told his wife he and some buddies were getting together to watch a game. He had the TV schedule open on his tablet screen. Whenever he provided details like that, he tripled-checked them first.

This time he took the minivan. He took her out to dinner and afterwards, they went to see a movie. The entire time, he kept his arm around her shoulder. She was wearing a short dress and he was tempted to place his hand on her thigh, but for now he wanted to show her he was a gentleman.

Afterwards, they went for a stroll along the canal. At the end of the trail, they stopped to kiss. Her lips were soft and sweet, yeilding. She began grinding her hips against his growing bulge.

""Want to go for a drive?"" he asked and she nodded. They held hands as he led her to his van. This time his ring was tucked safely into the change pocket of his wallet. She hadn't yet asked if he was married or involved with anyone else and he had no compulsion to tell her.

He drove her up to a secluded spot, a lookout near the top of the mountain. He parked next to a tall oak tree, a vista of the city lights far below. Light from a full moon streamed in through the windshield.

They leaned across the gap between them and kissed, then climbed into the back. Lying her down on the seat, he pushed up her dress. No underpants this time. She'd shaved all but a patch above her slit.

He got down on the floor beside her and explored her silky nether regions with his tongue, teasing around her clit. For several minutes he lapped and licked, enveloping her pussy with his lips, suckling until she was squirming uncontrollably. Just as she was about to orgasm he pulled away, sat up and unzipped his pants.

Thank God for big cars, he thought as they shifted positions so that he was lying on his back. He held her waist as she straddled him and he eased her down onto his shaft. For several minutes she rode him, giving his prick a squeeze each time she lifted up. Her breathing grew more frantic and she came, moaning, her muscles clamping his cock. She threw her head back, her chest heaving. She sat still for some moments, catching her breath.

The most awkward part was sitting up and cramming his erect shaft back into his pants again. He hated condoms and couldn't risk coming inside of her. She smiled sheepishly as she pulled her dress down, not offering to finish him off. Not that he wanted her to. Less guilt he'd feel blowing her off, later.

They drove to her building in silence for the first stretch. Closer to home, she asked him what his plans were the coming weekend. He hesitated and she began pressing for details. Two weeks in and it felt like she was trying to possess him, now that she'd put out for him.

He parked under the streetlamp, right in front of her place. She invited him up, but he told her he had to get home; an early morning helping a neighbour move something tomorrow. ""I'll call you,"" he said, knowing she wouldn't let him kiss her now that his lips had been other places.

""Good night."" She stumbled out of his car and staggered to the entrance of her building. Once she'd unlocked it, she gave him a quick wave and he drove off.

It was only a twenty-minute drive to his house and all the way, his groin throbbed. He parked in the driveway and got out. Late getting home, his wife was right inside the front door when he came in, waiting for him.

""How was your night?"" she asked, her eyes shining wide in the darkness of the entryway. His heart fluttered.

""A little tiring, but okay,"" he said, trying to sound casual.

Pressing her body against him, she whispered in his ear, ""What were you up to that would tire you out, hm? You told me you'd be hanging out at the bar,watching the game. Your team lost, by the way.""

He leaned against the wall next to the doorframe, his head swimming, his pulse racing.

She undid his belt, unzipped his pants and freed his erect shaft. Dropping to her knees, she stared up at him as her tongue fell out of her mouth. She gave the tip a long, sensual lick, swirling her tongue all around.

""I can taste her, you bad boy,"" she said, in a tone that sent shivers up his spine. ""No condom. What if she got knocked up?""

""I pulled out in plenty of time,"" he said, grinning down at her, aching to plunge it back into her mouth and down her throat.

She stood again and kissed him once more, probing his mouth with her tongue. ""You licked her pussy, didn't you.""

""It was so sweet and wet,"" he said, his breath shuddering. ""Tiny little waist, perky little breasts."" He held up the two fingers he'd stuck inside Kate and pressed them to his wife's lips. Her cheeks hollowed as she sucked off the remains of the other woman's juices.

""She does taste sweet. Let me lick the rest of her off of you."" She lowered herself again and he clutched her hair in his fists, thrusting his hips as she sucked him off.

Later that night, the two of them watched the footage he'd captured from cameras they'd set up all over the inside of the minivan. ""She's cute,"" his wife said, cupping his balls in her fingers. ""Are you going to see her again?""

""I think she'd asked me if I was busy this Friday."" He slumped down against the headboard while she worked his shaft.

""Take her somewhere nice for dinner."" His wife straddled his hips and began rubbing her slash with the tip of his cock. ""Text me if you're not going to be home that night.""

His breath hitched in his throat as she eased herself down onto him and kissed around his neck. She was soaking wet. ""I want you to take your sweet time making love to her. I want to hear everything.""

She flattened her palms on his chest and began bucking her hips. With a quean for a wife, he had best of both worlds. He got the thrill of cheating, only it wasn't her he betrayed.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

My name is Mallory I met Kyle when I was 18. It was love at first sight. We fucked like rabbits. We experimented with kinky stuff like threesomes, swapping, etc. Basically we partied like teenagers. Until Courtney was conceived. I was 20 the day she was born. We got married shortly after she blessed our lives. Everything then changed...

Especially Kyle. Sex barely happened when it did it was just for him. He couldn't keep a job. He blamed me and Court for all his problems. Long story short 5 years in we divorced and he disappeared. It was just my daughter and I for a few years. They were the worst years of my life, if not for Courtney I would have given up. Kyle eventually straightened out. Cleaned up, got a good job, and started sharing in the parenting duties. We even became friendly, not friends, but friendly. I was around 28 at the time and I will be honest I started slutting it up the times my daughter was with her dad.

When I was 33 I encountered Michael at a bar hanging out with a group of friends; both girls and boys. That night like many other nights I was looking for a hook up. Man or woman; didn't matter to me I loved fooling around with both. Anyway that night I was with some of my girl friends, one of whom I would probably end up in bed with if things didn't go well with other people in the bar. LOL. But when I saw him I knew he was the man for me that night. He was amazing. I could tell he was the center of attention among his friends.

It was obvious that women wanted him but that night he ended up with me. We had a whirlwind relationship and enjoyed many adventures. We were open and honest about our desires and would explore them together. It was loving and liberating, we would have threesomes and moresomes both with women and men. I am definitely bi and he is a little bit bi. (he likes fem men and will also partake in men during foursomes, etc.). But neither of us had any idea how much we would love cuckqueaning it wasn't even anything we really knew about. Although looking back I should have realized my feeling for it were strong. When we would share a woman in a threesome I realize now how much I enjoyed seeing him with her. Our first encounter with it wasn't even really our choice...at first.

Michael and I dated for about three years and then got married. Our first cuckqueaning adventure happened about a month after the wedding. We wanted to go out for the evening, some place we could dance and let loose. It wasn't our intention to find an adventure but we were always open to one. We went to a club nearby that always had a good mix of people, from younger college age to career age to more mature.

When we first got there we sat at a bar facing the crowd. I scanned the dance floor trying to see what could be seen I noticed many interesting people. I saw young women dancing in very skimpy clothing, a couple that had obviously taken dance classes together and wanted to show off, and I even saw a much older man dancing alone but having the best time of anyone there. But my eyes stopped at a very, very hot blonde. She was wearing a tight red dress that left little to the imagination. She was probably around 30 and didn't seem to be with anyone but didn't seem to be alone either I could not tell. She wasn't really dancing but she wasn't really just standing there either. Her rather large breasts were practically falling out of the top of her dress but they did it in a very classy way. I have to admit I noticed and admired her, but quickly moved on from her as my husband and I finished our drinks and decided to dance ourselves.

We did and enjoyed it. I was wearing a black party dress with black thigh high fishnet stockings and fairly high heels. I am 5'4 115 lbs with 34c breasts. I looked good and people noticed which I and my hubby like. We took a break to relieve ourselves and get more drinks. This cycle continued for a couple hours. Every once and awhile I would notice the hottie in the red dress as she was always in the periphery, just on the edge of my sight. It seemed like she was watching us but it also seemed like she was watching others.

A few times Michael and I would dance near or with other people too. There was a really cute girl there with some friends that seemed intriguing for us to flirt with. She seemed into it and i was getting a little excited at the prospect of having her come home with us. She would dance and grind with me and then she would dance and grind with Michael. This fun ended abruptly because one of her friends got sick and they all left to take care of her. After she left my husband and I made out quite intensely in the hallway near the bathroom. At one point I swear I saw the hot blonde nearby but I wasn't sure...after another drink or two we headed back to the dance floor, it was really crowded by this time...little did I know how quickly our lives were about to change.

We danced a few feet from each other. All of a sudden from out of the darkness surrounding the dance floor she appeared next to Michael. She didn't seem to be intruding she was just dancing next to us but mostly next to him. I got intrigued since she was by far the best looking girl in the place, a threesome with her would be to die for.

However she didn't seem to care that I was there. She was clearly there for Michael. She would get inappropriately close to him but then the next instant she would be a foot or two away facing the other way. Something seemed kind of off about it so I decided to stake my claim for my husband. I got right between them during a time she was facing the other way. I had my arms around him and was moving seductively. I made eye contact with her and she just slyly smiled at me. It sent chills down my back but at the same time I was very turned on by the look. As I danced close to Michael I could tell that he was becoming aroused himself. I was facing Michael and grinding and dancing with him hoping the girl in the red dress got the hint.

She didn't. As I was dancing close to Michael I could feel the presence of a body on the other side of him. And then her arms were around his waist and her hand was grabbing his crotch as she turned him around toward her. I could not have been more pissed off. I was so angry I could barely see straight so I stepped back and was going to walk around and tell the bitch off. Before I could though I looked at them together, she in her sexy as hell red dress grinding her ass into his crotch. They looked hot together, I could almost see them naked with his cock pounding her pussy as she bent over in front of him. I was mad but at the same time I was getting excited and wet.

To be honest I had to pause and get my bearings straight. I was getting dizzy. I have never been madder at a person than I was at the bitch in the red dress but at the same time they looked so damn good together. Like I said we were really open sexually so a threesome with this girl was not out of the question but she seemed to have no interest in me. That is not entirely true she seemed to enjoy humiliating me. After admiring them for a moment or two my anger came out again and I said to her, ""Hey, he is with me.""

""So?"" is all the bitch said. She looked up at my husband and whispered something in his ear that I could not hear. He smiled and looked sheepishly at me but only for a second as the blonde bitch took him by the hand and headed off the dance floor. As they passed me she quietly asked, ""Are you coming or not?""

I reluctantly followed. When we got outside we went to her car where she gave me her keys and told me where to drive to while her and Michael got in the back seat. I reluctantly and excitedly started to drive. I adjust the mirror and could see that they were already kissing and groping each other. He had one hand on her thigh squeezing while his other hand was rubbing her tits. She was undoing his pants to release his immensely hard cock. My mind was racing and my pussy was quaking. I was having a hard time paying attention to the road as I kept glancing at the rear view mirror. I shouldn't be driving my husband and his new lover to her house to fuck. ""Why?"" is all that kept going through my mind. But I can also tell that my lace boy-shorts were soaked.

His bulbous cock was practically shimmering in the dim light from the passing street lights. Her hand was stroking up and down the length of his 9 thick inches. They were kissing passionately and then she pulled away and she leaned down and put almost his whole cock in her mouth. ""Nooooo...!!"" I may have yelled or it may have been a moan as I might have cum at the sight of her mouth sucking his cock.

His back was as stiff as his cock as he sat back with his head back as she expertly sucked his manhood. I could tell he was close already and luckily so were we. As I pulled into her driveway he blew his rather large load into her mouth. She took as much as she could and let some drip out and onto his cock and balls. I parked the car his body shaking with ecstasy. She opened her door and said to me, ""He is going to need your help cleaning up slut.""

Not knowing what to say or do at that statement, I opened my door and walked around to her side of the car as she got out. I leaned into the car putting my hands on the seat with my ass up and my ass slightly exposed due to my dress hiking up. With the hot blonde bitch behind me I started licking up his cum. His cock was still pretty hard. I eagerly licked up and down his shaft gathering up any and all of his cum...mmmm I love the taste of his cum... I tried to do the best job I could hoping to out do her but while I was cleaning him up I felt a hard slap on my almost exposed ass. I came again instantly. She then pulled me out by the hips and grabbed his hand and got him and walked into her house.

Once in the house she offered him a drink and he accepted, I got nothing. Her living room area is connected to a kitchen where she went to make the drinks. She said to make ourselves comfortable, well she told Michael to make himself comfortable. I looked at Michael and mouthed, ""What is going on here?"" He shrugged and sat on the sectional couch as I reluctantly sat on a rather large sized chair opposite him.

When she got back with their drinks he looked at her and said, ""Thank you Taylor."" So her name is Taylor seems fitting for some reason. My anger was again starting to boil over and yet my eyes could not take themselves off her incredible body. Her legs were long and shapely, her ass was tight and popped out of her tight fitting dress, her hips were wide and sexy, and her large breasts were falling out of the v of the neckline. I wanted to kill her...I also wanted her so bad my body was aching.

""You are welcome Michael, I really want you to enjoy yourself while you are here,"" she sat down on the couch next to him. ""Do you think you will like it here?"" she said seductively as if she could say something that wasn't.

His eyes never left hers as he nodded. She leaned in and kissed him. They embraced and kissed for a minute before she left his arms and lifted her legs up onto the couch. She put one leg on each side of him her legs spread open the bare pale skin above her black thigh high stockings was visible. Not able to stop myself at this point I also spread my legs revealing my light pink silk panties I started rubbing my pussy over them. My panties were so wet. I could not believe I was doing it to myself as my husband was literally cheating on me less than ten feet away.

Her dress hiked up even more as his hands were rubbing the bare skin between her stockings and her black lace panties that I could now see. Her hands were removing his shirt and running up and down his very fit chest. The sight of him shirtless always gets me excited. It was obvious that he worked out but not too much. He was slim, his pecs were round and firm, and his stomach was tight with a hint of a six pack. He has a little bit of hair on his chest but not much. Just enough to be sexy as hell. Taylor must have agreed as she was petting his chest hair as he was now rubbing her pussy through her panties.

She decided to move so she removed her hands from his chest...all she did was stand up which made his hands leave her as well. He was disappointed and expressed as much with a loud sigh. She finally looked directly at me, I got even more excited. Maybe now her teasing was over and she would show me some attention. I came slightly in anticipation of her walking over and kissing me too.

She giggled as she sat back down this time putting her back to Michael so he could unzip her which he did. He pushed the top of her dress down revealing her magnificent breasts. They must have been DD her bra was very pretty and matched her panties. She looked at me and smiled...I thought it was invitation so I got up to go over and touch the nicest pair of titties I have ever seen. Her face turned grim as she shook her head and pointed back at the chair, ""Sit, slut"" I did, I have never been more disappointed in all my life.

She turned around slightly to take off my husband's pants she removed them and his boxers at the same time. As they moved down and cleared where his cock was it popped out as stiff and hard as I can remember seeing it. I could swear I heard it go ""boing"". She stood up again his hand went right to his stiff, throbbing member and stroked it gently as she removed the rest of her dress. Facing me she shimmied out of it.

I could now see the hottest woman ever in her black bra, panties, and stockings. My hand was inside my pink ones furiously rubbing up and down and down and up my wet slit. My clitoris was quivering every time I rubbed over it. She reached behind her back and undid her bra it fell into her other hand. Taylor then tossed it right at me and it landed on my shoulder. It smelled like the pretty perfume I knew she was wearing...Intoxicating...My middle finger easily slipped into my pussy passed my swollen lips.

The hot blonde bitch then put a hand on each of her hips and bent down her hands going down her legs bringing her panties with them as she stepped out of them and again tossed them my way. This time they hit my knee and lingered for a second before they fell to the floor. I pulled my hand out of my panties and tried to catch them but failed. For some reason I was very upset that they did. I looked down at her black panties wishing I had them, not sure what to do I looked up and she was mounting my husbands extremely hard and big, thick cock.

""No! Don't..."" I said with anguish, I just knew that this was going past a line I knew I didn't want to cross.

She again looked my way as she slowly slid down his throbbing, thick 9 inches like it was nothing. She pushed herself all the way down onto him, all of him in her. She slowly moved her hips and ass back and forth and side to side, her hands on his chest, and her head back moaning quietly. Then she lifted her hips up and his cock slid out again till only his head was in her...she leaned in and kissed him passionately. Then her hips went down again and up slowly and rhythmically. I stood up to stop them...but couldn't.

The looks on their faces were intoxicating. They were both so pleased. I thought I had seen Michael enjoy sex before but I had never seen him like this. As if it was the best sex ever. On the surface I was pissed off and wanted it to stop. But deep down my primal urge was to make sure my man was happy and this hot blonde bitch was making him more happy than I ever had. How could I deny him this pleasure. Just this once I told myself. Just this once I will let this go...Besides she is gorgeous and I didn't want to deny myself the pleasure of seeing her in such a state as I was seeing her in. As I stood there staring I removed my dress...It fell to the ground and I stood there in light pink panties and bra. Unlike when she removed hers though nobody noticed me do the same.

I was confused because I could not figure out why that too turned me on. I sat back down but not before picking up her wet, soiled panties. I was not sure why I just knew I needed them. I put them up to my nose and smelled them deeply...her aroma was stimulating. I removed my panties and as I looked over at the lovers fucking I rubbed my incredibly wet pussy with her wet black panties. I had never done anything like that before but I needed to be near her and didn't think I would be. Still on top of Michael straddling him she stopped moving and looked at me and giggled, ""Those are a woman's panty unlike your little girl ones...If you want to know what a woman's panties feel like put them on.""

I did...I wasn't sure I wanted to but before my brain could protest too much my hands and arms were putting them on. I couldn't believe I did it but they felt great on me.

It was at that moment that I noticed the look on my husband's face...It was the look he gets when he is trying very hard not to cum. I was so stimulated...in her panties and knowing he was about to blow his load deep inside her as she lifted up and down his cock. Slowly for a bit and then faster and then slow and then stop...She could tell he was close too as she pulled his cock all the way out and paused...right before she pushed down fast and hard.

All the way down his shaft until she was sitting on him where she moved her hips around and around until he could no longer hold it. His hips pushing up into her trying to get it even deeper he exploded into her pussy. His body quaking and quivering and shaking. I could imagine her pussy tightening around his cock as she also came deeply. I may have moaned the loudest as I too came. Two fingers deep in my pussy her panties at my knees. I don't even remember doing that.

She collapsed onto his chest..her blonde hair covering him. His cock finally softening as it fell out of her. My pussy was clamped around my fingers as wave after wave of ecstasy came over me. I leaned back into the chair, my body spent. Not knowing what to expect next Taylor looked at me and said, ""Now...now you can come over Slut.""

I was wondering why she would call me that again. I was not the slut or was I. I stood up and walked over to the other side of the couch as she rolled over and placed her head on Michael's stomach. Her big tits jiggling as she did. I sat down about a foot away from her. She spread her legs and I saw that she was not completely shaved like I was. She was very neatly trimmed. No hair by her lips but on her mound was a very cute blonde bush. It was so light one might not even know she had a bush if they weren't as close I was at that moment. The other thing I noticed was how wet it was between her legs. Taylor's thighs and pussy were covered in her juice and sweat and my husbands sperm was starting to drip out. ""Do I need to tell my little slut what to do next?""

Again I was in a daze not sure what to do. But I had come this far and I think it was too late to stop anyways. Besides the moment I had wanted most of the night was finally here, I was finally going to taste her pussy. It didn't matter that it was so messy as I leaned in and down and kissed her right on the lips. My hands gripping her tight, bare thighs...my nose at her swollen clit my tongue lapping up Michael and her juices.

I always have loved my husbands cum but mixed with her juice it was so much better. I licked it and licked it my tongue going up and down her labia over and over again and then pushing between them and into her getting every drop of his cum I could get. Her body was squirming to my touching I was pleased...She pushed my head deeper into her. I rubbed my face around her wet juicy thighs. I loved eating pussy like this. I even heard her to say to Michael, ""Mmmm, the slut is good at something...mmmm.""

I doubt she would admit it but I am sure I made her cum again. My face still buried between her thighs I felt her sit up a little and my husband get up. He moved down closer to me. She pulled me out from the comfort of her thighs by my hair.",,2025-08-15T19:09:35.312386,1895,2.0

Merinda Giles was a woman who had everything. She had a billionaire husband and a delightful daughter. She worked for the advancement of feminism worldwide. Her life was perfect til the day her daughter brought home her worst enemy.

But far beyond that fateful day, Merinda was sitting in her office, listening to the most shocking proposal she had ever known. Apparently, an organization named FemLib requested a large amount of funds for their programs to ""liberate old women"". Their representative was a middle aged yet stunning lady called Emmanuelle who was giving the presentation.

""And that's the end of our proposal Mrs. Giles. We would like your Bill & Merinda Foundation to wire 100 millions to FemLib's account by the end of this week"" Emmanuelle finished.

""In this proposal you mentioned that your organization would liberate old women from their responsibilities by...sending young girls to their houses!?"" Merinda confusedly asked.

""Yes"" Emmanuelle replied.

""And the budget for this project execution is 100 million dollars?"" Merinda continued.

""Just for this phase only Mrs Giles, we intend to replicate this model to every State soon, which means the costs will rise up. You know pretty girls these days are high maintenance."" Emmanuelle stated.

""I don't see how this can work. The idea just doesn't make sense to me"" Merinda turned Emmanuelle down.

""It makes perfect sense Mrs. Giles"" Emmanuelle calmly explained ""My young girls will liberate old women like you from the responsibility of being a lifetime companion to your husband. They are well-trained to take care of your husband's needs like conversation, traveling, having sex, and even giving birth. You will have plenty of time for yourself to do chores and raise the kids. Isn't it wonderful for women of your age?"".

""That's insane,"" Merinda yelled.

""Perhaps you need to be enlightened, Merinda"" Emmanuelle smirked and left before Merinda could order a security guard to take her out.

-----

A few weeks later when Merinda had totally forgotten about the encounter with Emmanuelle, she saw a facebook post by her good friend Simone Buffett warning about activities of a sex cult named FemLib in Belgravia Hills.

""That woman is the head of a sex cult!?"" Merinda was surprised. Now it was clear to her why Emmanuelle possessed such twisted ideas. It was so fortunate that her foundation did not have any tie to that kind of organization. Still, she wondered why the proposal was on her table in the first place.

Merinda gave a heart reaction to her friend's post then went downstairs to prepare breakfast. Her husband Bill had left already for his morning run. Another normal yet peaceful day was coming.

By the afternoon, just when Merinda was about to have her afternoon tea, Bill's phone call arrived, describing a situation. Apparently, their daughter Jessica had rescued a girl who had just escaped from the very sex cult of Emmanuelle. This angered Merinda so much. Her daughter did the right thing to offer a temporary place to stay for this girl Nicole. Merinda agreed immediately, she couldn't ignore a lost girl in need.

That was how Merinda invited her worst enemy to the house she built.

-----

A month passed by without trouble, Merinda and Nicole were now good friends. Merinda also developed a sympathetic feeling towards the poor Nicole who had spent most of her life in a sex cult. Just like her daughter Jessica, Merinda wanted Nicole to experience many things in life. Upon learning of Nicole's passion for dancing, Merinda even asked her husband to help the girl.

Married by twenty years, Merinda knew that she and Bill had long passed their sex prime. However, recently her husband's sex drive suddenly hiked up. After every dance practice with Nicole, Bill would come back all sweat up and asked Merinda for sex. At first Merinda was happy, thinking that the second spring of their love had arrived. However, she soon realized that Bill's stamina was too much for her to take. Merinda was no longer in her twenty and each night of sex left her totally exhausted the morning after. She asked her husband for a more moderate sex routine. While Bill apologized, Merinda felt that it was her fault for not giving her husband the equivalent amount of love he gave her.

Lost in her confusion, Merinda sought out the help from her long time best friend Simone Buffett.

""Come on in"" Simone gave Merinda a welcome hug.

""Thanks for having me, Simone. Is Warrick home?"" Merinda asked.

""He is but he won't be bothering us. There is something far more interesting for him to do"" Simone said.

The two women had tea and talked over many things. Until the end, Merinda finally said what she came to seek advice for.

""So basically Bill's sex stamina is too much for you?"" Simone concluded.

""You can say so. I want to make him happy but physically I can't"" Merinda sadly said.

""Let me show you this,"" Simone said, directing Merinda to the second floor.

Merinda followed Simone to the master bedroom. As Merinda was approaching closer, she could hear loud moans coming from inside.

""Remember I told you that Warrick had a more interesting thing to do? This it it"" Simone opened the door.

On the bed, Warrick Buffett, the loving husband of her long time best friend, was fucking a young brunette no older than her daughter's age.

""Hello Merinda"" Warrick said while he was busy thrusting to his lover.

""I...I don't understand,"" Merinda said in panic. She couldn't imagine a model family like Buffett would have a secret like this.

""I have just been enlightened recently dear"" Simone calmly explained ""Just like your husband, Warrick is a man of high sex drive and he deserves a better woman than me"".

""Mistress Astriana had opened my eyes, Merinda. The ultimate form of love is self-sacrifice for your loved ones"" Simone continued.

""Come here, slave"" the brunette girl interrupted.

""Yes, mistress"" Simone replied, much to the horror of Merinda, then slowly crawled to the bed.

Couldn't bear to watch how low her friend had become, Merinda immediately fled the scene.

-----

Days after the event, Merinda's mood was low but she couldn't dare to let it affect her family. As Bill's libido had grown more and more, Merinda started to fear whenever her husband came back from his dance practice with a rock-hard cock in his pants.

One night, after a late online meeting, Merinda decided to come over the ballroom to check up on the hard-working dancers. Since Merinda didn't want to disturb them, she half opened the ballroom door to have a sneak peek to their practice.

At the center of the room, Bill and Nicole were waltzing across the floor in an intimate dance, their bodies touched each other in the process. Merinda gazed at the passionate dance scene. Though not very pleased, Merinda must admit that Bill looked much better with Nicole than her. Their heights, their body shapes, their beautiful looks were all matched.

The dance was getting more and more sensual. Under Nicole's instruction, Bill's lips travelled most parts of the girl's body. From her flawless neck to her sexy collarbone, down to her E-cup boobs and perfect fit thighs. As Bill held Nicole up in the air spinning, his hands were holding her big slippery butts while their noses touched.

Merinda could see Bill's crotch harden up in the process. She was so jealous but one thing held her back from intervening. It was her super wet cunt.

After the spin, Bill and Nicole sat down on a couch to rest, his face blushed like a tomato while Nicole's skin shined radiantly. Nicole took out a handkerchief from between her boobs. She gently patted it all over Bill's face, intentionally smearing his lips in the process. Nicole moved her hot body closer and closer to the still unaware Bill, until her E-cup boobs were rubbing against his muscular chest.

Then all of sudden, Nicole's hand moved down to Bill's crotch. She then started giving his married cock a sweet massage. Bill was totally taken by surprise. He gasped but didn't push Nicole away. This wicked newfound pleasure had stunned him.

""So big and hard huh, Mr. Giles?"" Nicole said, putting more pressure on the outside of his pants.

""This...is not...appropriate...Nicole"" Bill gasped heavily.

Nicole ignored his words and continued sliding her fingers on the length of his rock-hard cock. Sticky precum began to seep out of his pants fabric, making a visible wet spot.

""This poor creature was all hard. Please let me help it, Mr. Giles"" Nicole blew softly to Bill's ears, further spurring his desire for sex. His body bent backward welcoming the evil sensation.

As Nicole's hand began to unzip his pants, Bill suddenly gathered his strength and pushed Nicole away, so hard that she fell to the floor.

""STOP"" Bill yelled ""I'm married and I'll never cheat on my wife"".

""You said the exact same thing every time"" Nicole smirked. Merinda was horrified. Had they done this before? She watched the vixen crawled seductively on all fours to Bill's crotch. Nicole opened his thighs and put her face in between, started licking his cock from the outside.

The loving husband was defeated. Bill had had blow jobs many times before but none of them was half as good as this girl's skillful tongue. He had to get away from this girl immediately but his body didn't listen to him. Nicole began moving her tongue from his crotch to his six-pack stomach, up to his muscular chest where she sucked on his tits, licking all the skin on the way from his neck to his ear. Nicole then lunged her tongue in Bill's ear, twisting the inside, making him tremble with pleasure. She then whispered ""It's not cheating if you do not put it in, Mr. Giles"".

Nicole words took down the last of Bill's defense. She then easily pushed the 6'3"" Bill down to the couch. She rode on Bill fully clothed and started dry-humping him. Bill was defenseless. The pleasure had totally taken over him. At this moment, Nicole's words made much more sense in his mind. She was right, making out without intercourse couldn't count as cheating.

As Nicole was riding harder on his pants, Bill responded to the vixen by pumping his hips up and down, stimulating a thrusting action. His married dick was slapping hard to Nicole's cunt, with only a few thin layers of fabrics between them.

Merinda was heartbroken as she watched her husband lip-locked with the seductress. Bill turned Nicole upside down to resume his dominant position. His hands were squeezing the girl's big boobs. Merinda could see her husband's precum and Nicole's squirt had wetted all of their lower bodies.

How could her loving husband do this to her. Merinda cried but at the same time she felt a jolt of weird pleasure running over her body. The scene in front of her was so vivid, so much better than any porn she watched in college. It soon became an unbearable urge that made her kneeled down to the floor masturbating.

The two sinners continued rubbing each other, moaning louder and louder. On the other side of the door, Merinda was rubbing her clit faster, she could feel her orgasm coming.

Then finally, Bill let out a huge groan, ejaculating rocket of sperms in his pants. Upon hearing that, Merinda came so hard that she wetted the floor. Nicole wrapped the exhausted Bill in her arms and gave him a deep tongueful kiss. The two continued to dry-hump for a few minutes before the faithful husband got on his mind again.

""This was a mistake,"" Bill said. When the pleasure went by, his rationale returned to tell him how wrong his action was.

""You didn't do anything wrong, Mr. Giles,"" Nicole said, putting her fingers on Bill's lips.

""I know Mrs. Giles has reached the age when she can no longer satisfy your needs"" Nicole continued ""I'm always grateful for your family's kindness and I want to repay by helping you with your libido, so that you can love Mrs. Giles platonically without worries about the difference between your sexual needs"".

Bill pushed Nicole's hand away and stood up. He said ""I know you have good intentions but let's consider this never happened. I love my wife and I don't want to do anything that may hurt her"". He then walked away, leaving Nicole alone on the couch.

Merinda watched the whole action. She hurriedly left before Bill came out. Though Merinda was happy about Bill's declaration of love for her, she couldn't stop thinking about Nicole's words. It was true that she could no longer give Bill the satisfaction a pretty girl like Nicole could.

Merinda quickly climbed to bed and pretended to have fallen asleep. She could feel Bill climbed next to her and held her close in his arms. Merinda told herself that everything was fine. She still had the perfect life everyone dreamt of. Bill's action was merely his weak moment and what Nicole did was just out of her good intention, though a bit twisted due to her sex cult education.

However, deep down Merinda knew something had changed as the seed of an idea was planted.

-----

The following days, Merinda was busy with a feminism campaign of her foundation. She almost forgot all crazy things happened to her in just a short period of time.

Out of nowhere, a package arrived from Simone. After learning about the Buffetts' decadent lifestyle, Merinda tried to avoid her friend. She couldn't understand how a smart, sophisticated, and elegant person like Simone had fallen that low.

Merinda opened the package to find a book about lifestyle for women over 40 by an author named Emmanuelle Tellis. Merinda wondered why Simone would send her such a thing. She opened the book and read the first chapter. Its introduction was kinda normal, just like any other self-help book in the market.

However, as Merinda turned to chapter two, the drawing of a man with a young girl in his lap looking at an older woman kneeling in front of him caught her eyes. The chapter provided an introduction to a lifestyle called cuckquean, in which the wife would have to serve both her husband and his lover.

Shocked by the content, Merinca couldn't help reading the whole book. The more she read, the more she was horrified by it. How could a book like this be published? The name of the author was familiar. Wasn't she the sex cult leader Merinda met few months ago.

Merinda was outraged at Simone's attempt to bring her into this lifestyle. This was silly. Why on earth would any woman with dignity accept the cuckquean arrangement. Then suddenly, Merinda remembered the words Simone said ""ultimate form of love is self-sacrifice"". Perhaps those women could sacrifice their happiness for the happiness of their spouses. However, Merinda would never do that. The pride of a feminist couldn't allow her to stumble that low just for a man.

Despite having all disgusting thoughts for the book, Merinda had to admit that the illustrations were exceedingly good. Those naughty pictures made her vagina tickle with a warm sensation. The image of her husband and Nicole's dry-humping once again flashed through her mind. Merinda slowly put her fingers between her clit and began masturbating.

-----

The day of Nicole's dance competition had come. As Bill and Nicole walked out to the car, Merinda felt a bit of jealousy. They looked so good together. She shook her head to clear her mind and came back to the bedroom to complete some unfinished works.

After refreshing herself with a bath, Merinda was lying on bed reading her favorite book, waiting for Bill and the girls to come home. Suddenly, her phone range, it was Nicole

Merinda picked up the call and said hello but there was no response from the other end. She could hear some fabrics noise in the background. Something in Nicole's pocket must have accidentally touched a call button.

As Merinda was about to hang up, a deep manly moan got through. It was definitely her husband, Bill. Merinda was outraged. Were her husband and Nicole dry-humping each other again? Where were they doing it? Where was her daughter Jessica?

""Ohh...ohh...oh...YES...YES"" Bill continued moaning louder. Merinda could hear the sound of slurping in at intervals of his moans, was it Nicole giving Bill a blow-job?

A few minutes later, Bill screamed ""OH YESSSS"". After that, Merinda could hear the sweet seductive voice of Nicole ""You came quite a lot in my mouth dear. How long have you held up all that cum?""

Merinda was startled. She and Bill just had sex yesterday. Was that too long for her husband that he couldn't hold it anymore?

Seconds later, Merinda could hear her husband's faint voice ""We...shouldn't...do this, Nicole"" Bill was breathing heavily.

""It's not cheating if you don't put it in Mr. Bill"" Nicole said in her usual cheerful tone. Merinda could hear the sound of her husband's zipper pulled off.

""No...please...please stop"" Bill responded faintly. Merinda could tell her husband was trying hard to resist the temptation.

""I will only rub it between my clit. You're not cheating. Let's give yourself a reward tonight"" Nicole was very persuasive. Merinda could hear sounds of kisses and gasps. She wondered what her husband would do.

""Tonight you're not Mr. Bill Giles, the billionaire. Tonight you're just a boy who just won a dance cup. Tonight you're with the school's hottest girl in your dad's car..."" Nicole spoke softly. Merinda couldn't hear much as Nicole's words were getting smaller and smaller like whispers.

Then a loud sound broke the silence, it was the sound of fabrics tearing. Nicole screamed ""YASSS"". Merinda heard the sound of heavy slurping. Based on Nicole's reaction, it must be Bill sucking on her tits.

Merinda wanted to yell at the phone to wake her husband from his decadent fantasy but her hands were busy touching her clit. The content of the book about the cuckquean lifestyle, the images of her husband and Nicole's dry-humping, the sounds of them making out in real time, all that combined had created an unstoppable urge forcing Merinda to masturbate.

""FUCK...FUCCCKK...KEEP RUBBING LIKE THAT...OH YASSS...YASSSS...YOU'RE SO BIGGGG""

""FUCK...FUCK...FUCK, I'M CUMMINGGGG""

The sounds of Bill and Nicole making out were so theatrical. Merinda could picture herself standing there watching them consummated in the forbidden desire.

""Bad, bad, bad boy! You have teared and stained my most beautiful dress"" Nicole seductively said. Merinda could picture the image of Nicole covered in Bill's cum.

In response to Nicole was the sound of another wet sensual kiss. Bill must have proactively kissed the evil teen. Sounds of another making out session began to fill up Merinda's bedroom.

The cycles continued for three hours straight, with Nicole and Bill kissing, rubbing, cumming, and kissing again while Merinda was listening to their every action and reached orgasm herself. Merinda was amazed at her husband's stamina. Was Bill always that good before? Merinda couldn't remember. Even during the prime time of their marriage, her husband had never had that much passion for her.

Maybe, Nicole was the true sexual match for Bill. Perhaps, the girl should be the one having the right to have sex with Bill instead of Merinda.

""Just for this phase only Mrs Giles, we intend to replicate this model to every State soon, which means the costs will rise up. You know pretty girls these days are high maintenance."" Emmanuelle stated.

""I don't see how this can work. The idea just doesn't make sense to me"" Merinda turned Emmanuelle down.

""It makes perfect sense Mrs. Giles"" Emmanuelle calmly explained ""My young girls will liberate old women like you from the responsibility of being a lifetime companion to your husband. They are well-trained to take care of your husband's needs like conversation, traveling, having sex, and even giving birth. You will have plenty of time for yourself to do chores and raise the kids. Isn't it wonderful for women of your age?"".

""That's insane,"" Merinda yelled.

""Perhaps you need to be enlightened, Merinda"" Emmanuelle smirked and left before Merinda could order a security guard to take her out.

-----

A few weeks later when Merinda had totally forgotten about the encounter with Emmanuelle, she saw a facebook post by her good friend Simone Buffett warning about activities of a sex cult named FemLib in Belgravia Hills.

""That woman is the head of a sex cult!?"" Merinda was surprised. Now it was clear to her why Emmanuelle possessed such twisted ideas. It was so fortunate that her foundation did not have any tie to that kind of organization. Still, she wondered why the proposal was on her table in the first place.

Merinda gave a heart reaction to her friend's post then went downstairs to prepare breakfast. Her husband Bill had left already for his morning run. Another normal yet peaceful day was coming.

By the afternoon, just when Merinda was about to have her afternoon tea, Bill's phone call arrived, describing a situation. Apparently, their daughter Jessica had rescued a girl who had just escaped from the very sex cult of Emmanuelle. This angered Merinda so much. Her daughter did the right thing to offer a temporary place to stay for this girl Nicole. Merinda agreed immediately, she couldn't ignore a lost girl in need.

That was how Merinda invited her worst enemy to the house she built.

-----

A month passed by without trouble, Merinda and Nicole were now good friends. Merinda also developed a sympathetic feeling towards the poor Nicole who had spent most of her life in a sex cult. Just like her daughter Jessica, Merinda wanted Nicole to experience many things in life. Upon learning of Nicole's passion for dancing, Merinda even asked her husband to help the girl.

Married by twenty years, Merinda knew that she and Bill had long passed their sex prime. However, recently her husband's sex drive suddenly hiked up. After every dance practice with Nicole, Bill would come back all sweat up and asked Merinda for sex. At first Merinda was happy, thinking that the second spring of their love had arrived. However, she soon realized that Bill's stamina was too much for her to take. Merinda was no longer in her twenty and each night of sex left her totally exhausted the morning after. She asked her husband for a more moderate sex routine. While Bill apologized, Merinda felt that it was her fault for not giving her husband the equivalent amount of love he gave her.

Lost in her confusion, Merinda sought out the help from her long time best friend Simone Buffett.

""Come on in"" Simone gave Merinda a welcome hug.

""Thanks for having me, Simone. Is Warrick home?"" Merinda asked.

""He is but he won't be bothering us. There is something far more interesting for him to do"" Simone said.

The two women had tea and talked over many things. Until the end, Merinda finally said what she came to seek advice for.

""So basically Bill's sex stamina is too much for you?"" Simone concluded.

""You can say so. I want to make him happy but physically I can't"" Merinda sadly said.

""Let me show you this,"" Simone said, directing Merinda to the second floor.

Merinda followed Simone to the master bedroom. As Merinda was approaching closer, she could hear loud moans coming from inside.

""Remember I told you that Warrick had a more interesting thing to do? This it it"" Simone opened the door.

On the bed, Warrick Buffett, the loving husband of her long time best friend, was fucking a young brunette no older than her daughter's age.

""Hello Merinda"" Warrick said while he was busy thrusting to his lover.

""I...I don't understand,"" Merinda said in panic. She couldn't imagine a model family like Buffett would have a secret like this.

""I have just been enlightened recently dear"" Simone calmly explained ""Just like your husband, Warrick is a man of high sex drive and he deserves a better woman than me"".

""Mistress Astriana had opened my eyes, Merinda. The ultimate form of love is self-sacrifice for your loved ones"" Simone continued.

""Come here, slave"" the brunette girl interrupted.

""Yes, mistress"" Simone replied, much to the horror of Merinda, then slowly crawled to the bed.

Couldn't bear to watch how low her friend had become, Merinda immediately fled the scene.

-----

Days after the event, Merinda's mood was low but she couldn't dare to let it affect her family. As Bill's libido had grown more and more, Merinda started to fear whenever her husband came back from his dance practice with a rock-hard cock in his pants.

One night, after a late online meeting, Merinda decided to come over the ballroom to check up on the hard-working dancers. Since Merinda didn't want to disturb them, she half opened the ballroom door to have a sneak peek to their practice.

At the center of the room, Bill and Nicole were waltzing across the floor in an intimate dance, their bodies touched each other in the process. Merinda gazed at the passionate dance scene. Though not very pleased, Merinda must admit that Bill looked much better with Nicole than her. Their heights, their body shapes, their beautiful looks were all matched.

The dance was getting more and more sensual. Under Nicole's instruction, Bill's lips travelled most parts of the girl's body. From her flawless neck to her sexy collarbone, down to her E-cup boobs and perfect fit thighs. As Bill held Nicole up in the air spinning, his hands were holding her big slippery butts while their noses touched.

Merinda could see Bill's crotch harden up in the process. She was so jealous but one thing held her back from intervening. It was her super wet cunt.

After the spin, Bill and Nicole sat down on a couch to rest, his face blushed like a tomato while Nicole's skin shined radiantly. Nicole took out a handkerchief from between her boobs. She gently patted it all over Bill's face, intentionally smearing his lips in the process. Nicole moved her hot body closer and closer to the still unaware Bill, until her E-cup boobs were rubbing against his muscular chest.

Then all of sudden, Nicole's hand moved down to Bill's crotch. She then started giving his married cock a sweet massage. Bill was totally taken by surprise. He gasped but didn't push Nicole away. This wicked newfound pleasure had stunned him.

""So big and hard huh, Mr. Giles?"" Nicole said, putting more pressure on the outside of his pants.

""This...is not...appropriate...Nicole"" Bill gasped heavily.

Nicole ignored his words and continued sliding her fingers on the length of his rock-hard cock. Sticky precum began to seep out of his pants fabric, making a visible wet spot.

""This poor creature was all hard. Please let me help it, Mr. Giles"" Nicole blew softly to Bill's ears, further spurring his desire for sex. His body bent backward welcoming the evil sensation.

As Nicole's hand began to unzip his pants, Bill suddenly gathered his strength and pushed Nicole away, so hard that she fell to the floor.

""STOP"" Bill yelled ""I'm married and I'll never cheat on my wife"".

""You said the exact same thing every time"" Nicole smirked. Merinda was horrified. Had they done this before? She watched the vixen crawled seductively on all fours to Bill's crotch. Nicole opened his thighs and put her face in between, started licking his cock from the outside.

The loving husband was defeated. Bill had had blow jobs many times before but none of them was half as good as this girl's skillful tongue. He had to get away from this girl immediately but his body didn't listen to him. Nicole began moving her tongue from his crotch to his six-pack stomach, up to his muscular chest where she sucked on his tits, licking all the skin on the way from his neck to his ear. Nicole then lunged her tongue in Bill's ear, twisting the inside, making him tremble with pleasure. She then whispered ""It's not cheating if you do not put it in, Mr. Giles"".

Nicole words took down the last of Bill's defense. She then easily pushed the 6'3"" Bill down to the couch. She rode on Bill fully clothed and started dry-humping him. Bill was defenseless. The pleasure had totally taken over him. At this moment, Nicole's words made much more sense in his mind. She was right, making out without intercourse couldn't count as cheating.

As Nicole was riding harder on his pants, Bill responded to the vixen by pumping his hips up and down, stimulating a thrusting action. His married dick was slapping hard to Nicole's cunt, with only a few thin layers of fabrics between them.

Merinda was heartbroken as she watched her husband lip-locked with the seductress. Bill turned Nicole upside down to resume his dominant position. His hands were squeezing the girl's big boobs. Merinda could see her husband's precum and Nicole's squirt had wetted all of their lower bodies.

How could her loving husband do this to her. Merinda cried but at the same time she felt a jolt of weird pleasure running over her body. The scene in front of her was so vivid, so much better than any porn she watched in college. It soon became an unbearable urge that made her kneeled down to the floor masturbating.

The two sinners continued rubbing each other, moaning louder and louder. On the other side of the door, Merinda was rubbing her clit faster, she could feel her orgasm coming.

Then finally, Bill let out a huge groan, ejaculating rocket of sperms in his pants. Upon hearing that, Merinda came so hard that she wetted the floor. Nicole wrapped the exhausted Bill in her arms and gave him a deep tongueful kiss. The two continued to dry-hump for a few minutes before the faithful husband got on his mind again.

""This was a mistake,"" Bill said. When the pleasure went by, his rationale returned to tell him how wrong his action was.

""You didn't do anything wrong, Mr. Giles,"" Nicole said, putting her fingers on Bill's lips.

""I know Mrs. Giles has reached the age when she can no longer satisfy your needs"" Nicole continued ""I'm always grateful for your family's kindness and I want to repay by helping you with your libido, so that you can love Mrs. Giles platonically without worries about the difference between your sexual needs"".

Bill pushed Nicole's hand away and stood up. He said ""I know you have good intentions but let's consider this never happened. I love my wife and I don't want to do anything that may hurt her"". He then walked away, leaving Nicole alone on the couch.

Merinda watched the whole action. She hurriedly left before Bill came out. Though Merinda was happy about Bill's declaration of love for her, she couldn't stop thinking about Nicole's words. It was true that she could no longer give Bill the satisfaction a pretty girl like Nicole could.

Merinda quickly climbed to bed and pretended to have fallen asleep. She could feel Bill climbed next to her and held her close in his arms. Merinda told herself that everything was fine. She still had the perfect life everyone dreamt of. Bill's action was merely his weak moment and what Nicole did was just out of her good intention, though a bit twisted due to her sex cult education.

However, deep down Merinda knew something had changed as the seed of an idea was planted.

-----

The following days, Merinda was busy with a feminism campaign of her foundation. She almost forgot all crazy things happened to her in just a short period of time.

Out of nowhere, a package arrived from Simone. After learning about the Buffetts' decadent lifestyle, Merinda tried to avoid her friend. She couldn't understand how a smart, sophisticated, and elegant person like Simone had fallen that low.

Merinda opened the package to find a book about lifestyle for women over 40 by an author named Emmanuelle Tellis. Merinda wondered why Simone would send her such a thing. She opened the book and read the first chapter. Its introduction was kinda normal, just like any other self-help book in the market.

However, as Merinda turned to chapter two, the drawing of a man with a young girl in his lap looking at an older woman kneeling in front of him caught her eyes. The chapter provided an introduction to a lifestyle called cuckquean, in which the wife would have to serve both her husband and his lover.

Shocked by the content, Merinca couldn't help reading the whole book. The more she read, the more she was horrified by it. How could a book like this be published? The name of the author was familiar. Wasn't she the sex cult leader Merinda met few months ago.

Merinda was outraged at Simone's attempt to bring her into this lifestyle. This was silly. Why on earth would any woman with dignity accept the cuckquean arrangement. Then suddenly, Merinda remembered the words Simone said ""ultimate form of love is self-sacrifice"". Perhaps those women could sacrifice their happiness for the happiness of their spouses. However, Merinda would never do that. The pride of a feminist couldn't allow her to stumble that low just for a man.

Despite having all disgusting thoughts for the book, Merinda had to admit that the illustrations were exceedingly good. Those naughty pictures made her vagina tickle with a warm sensation. The image of her husband and Nicole's dry-humping once again flashed through her mind. Merinda slowly put her fingers between her clit and began masturbating.

-----

The day of Nicole's dance competition had come. As Bill and Nicole walked out to the car, Merinda felt a bit of jealousy. They looked so good together. She shook her head to clear her mind and came back to the bedroom to complete some unfinished works.

After refreshing herself with a bath, Merinda was lying on bed reading her favorite book, waiting for Bill and the girls to come home. Suddenly, her phone range, it was Nicole

Merinda picked up the call and said hello but there was no response from the other end. She could hear some fabrics noise in the background. Something in Nicole's pocket must have accidentally touched a call button.

As Merinda was about to hang up, a deep manly moan got through. It was definitely her husband, Bill. Merinda was outraged. Were her husband and Nicole dry-humping each other again? Where were they doing it? Where was her daughter Jessica?

""Ohh...ohh...oh...YES...YES"" Bill continued moaning louder. Merinda could hear the sound of slurping in at intervals of his moans, was it Nicole giving Bill a blow-job?

A few minutes later, Bill screamed ""OH YESSSS"". After that, Merinda could hear the sweet seductive voice of Nicole ""You came quite a lot in my mouth dear. How long have you held up all that cum?""

Merinda was startled. She and Bill just had sex yesterday. Was that too long for her husband that he couldn't hold it anymore?

Seconds later, Merinda could hear her husband's faint voice ""We...shouldn't...do this, Nicole"" Bill was breathing heavily.

""It's not cheating if you don't put it in Mr. Bill"" Nicole said in her usual cheerful tone. Merinda could hear the sound of her husband's zipper pulled off.

""No...please...please stop"" Bill responded faintly. Merinda could tell her husband was trying hard to resist the temptation.

""I will only rub it between my clit. You're not cheating. Let's give yourself a reward tonight"" Nicole was very persuasive. Merinda could hear sounds of kisses and gasps. She wondered what her husband would do.

""Tonight you're not Mr. Bill Giles, the billionaire. Tonight you're just a boy who just won a dance cup. Tonight you're with the school's hottest girl in your dad's car..."" Nicole spoke softly. Merinda couldn't hear much as Nicole's words were getting smaller and smaller like whispers.

Then a loud sound broke the silence, it was the sound of fabrics tearing. Nicole screamed ""YASSS"". Merinda heard the sound of heavy slurping. Based on Nicole's reaction, it must be Bill sucking on her tits.

Merinda wanted to yell at the phone to wake her husband from his decadent fantasy but her hands were busy touching her clit. The content of the book about the cuckquean lifestyle, the images of her husband and Nicole's dry-humping, the sounds of them making out in real time, all that combined had created an unstoppable urge forcing Merinda to masturbate.

""FUCK...FUCCCKK...KEEP RUBBING LIKE THAT...OH YASSS...YASSSS...YOU'RE SO BIGGGG""

""FUCK...FUCK...FUCK, I'M CUMMINGGGG""

The sounds of Bill and Nicole making out were so theatrical. Merinda could picture herself standing there watching them consummated in the forbidden desire.

""Bad, bad, bad boy! You have teared and stained my most beautiful dress"" Nicole seductively said. Merinda could picture the image of Nicole covered in Bill's cum.

In response to Nicole was the sound of another wet sensual kiss. Bill must have proactively kissed the evil teen. Sounds of another making out session began to fill up Merinda's bedroom.

The cycles continued for three hours straight, with Nicole and Bill kissing, rubbing, cumming, and kissing again while Merinda was listening to their every action and reached orgasm herself. Merinda was amazed at her husband's stamina. Was Bill always that good before? Merinda couldn't remember. Even during the prime time of their marriage, her husband had never had that much passion for her.

Maybe, Nicole was the true sexual match for Bill. Perhaps, the girl should be the one having the right to have sex with Bill instead of Merinda.",,2025-08-15T19:10:07.716879,3352,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/lisas-impact-on-our-lives-ch-03,Lisa's Impact on Our Lives Ch. 03,Unknown Author,,,,,"The following morning started much the same as the previous day. The main difference was the weather, the rain came down hard. I was the first awake again. Lisa was tucked into Chris' shoulder still in a deep sleep.

""How are you doing?"" Chris asked, startling me a little. He was smiling and kissed me on the forehead.

I realized it was the first intimate moment we had had in the last couple of days.

""I am good."" I smiled and kissed his lips. I was so in love with him. Staring into his eyes I felt a ball of warmth inside. His happiness was my happiness.

I played with the hair on his chest and purred into his ear.

Soon I left to make coffee.

The smell of the coffee was enough to rouse Lisa and we all sat on the bed waking up.

When she finished her coffee, Lisa jumped up and said, ""Come on, I will let you scrub my back.""

It took a moment to realize she was talking to me, not Chris.

She grabbed my hand and led me to the bathroom.

When we got there, she quickly sat on the toilet and let go a long pee. It was strange to stand next to a woman peeing. It was also frustrating as I needed to pee just as bad.

Standing up, she moved aside so I could pee. I don't have a shy bladder, but usually I don't pee with someone watching. Making it a little stranger was Lisa tucking my hair behind my ears and looking into eyes. As had become the norm, she leaned down and kissed my lips.

Lisa then started the shower, and we hopped in. Handing me the soap she turned her back to me and lifted her hair. I guess she was serious about washing her back. Outside the shower I heard Chris come in for his morning pee.

""Don't flush!"" I reminded him out of habit.

Lisa turned around and presented her front to me, so I continued to wash her shoulders, chest and breasts. As I moved to her tummy, she spread her legs a little expecting me to also wash her vagina. It was funny, in the light of day, I would think vagina instead of pussy.

She then turns around again, bent slightly, and presented her ass. I washed between her cheeks as well.

Feeling clean, she hopped out of the shower.

""Don't be long"" she told me. ""I am getting hungry.""

I finished washing myself and put on my robe again.

Chris and Lisa were sat at the table drinking another round of coffee with Chris reading something on his phone.

""Toast and jam ok for breakfast?"" I asked, ""Not sure we have much else in.""

""That's fine."" Lisa replied.

Soon we were all having breakfast together.

""So, how does your bum feel this morning?"" Lisa asked me.

I blushed a little at the topic but replied anyway. ""A little... bruised""

""How about you Chris?"" Lisa switched over, ""How was it fucking her tight ass last night.""

Chris just about spit his coffee; this wasn't our normal topic of conversation in the morning. In fact, outside of the bedroom we rarely discussed sex.

""It was fantastic!"" Chris said, smiling at me.

""Her bum is so tiny, it looked like you might split her in two."" Lisa offered, ""Watching you slowly slide that fantastic cock of yours into her tight hole was really hot.""

Chris looked at me. ""I would love to do that again sometime.""

""Let me heal a bit first."" I suggested.

I wasn't opposed to the idea, but Chris did a lot more damage than my previous lover had. This wasn't ever going to be a two days in a row exercise.

Lisa darted her head under the table. ""He is still thinking about it now, his cock is hard.""

Chris looked a little shy for a moment, then switched to something else. Standing up he showed off his hard cock to the table.

""Well, he won't be able to concentrate on anything else today"" Lisa laughed, ""Blow him Jen!""

""What?"" I stammered, sucking back the last of my coffee.

""Blow him, suck is cock"" Lisa went on. ""He can't walk around all day with a hard-on.""

There was a sort of intensity in her voice. She wasn't asking me; she was telling me.

""Don't worry, I will clear the table, you get to work"" Lisa ordered once more.

Something in me told me to do it. I wanted to keep everyone happy.

I moved to my knees in front of Chris and took part of his cock into my mouth. Blowjobs for the sake of blowjobs was rare, I would suck him to get him hard to fuck, but I rarely just gave him a blowjob unexpectedly. It felt sexy in a way to just give pleasure. Chris was loving it; he was letting me do the work and just stood there with his coffee in his hand. It took about 10 minutes before I felt the little signs he was going to cum.

Suddenly he erupted in my mouth. Normally, I get a little warning, or he pulls out and cums on my tits. This time he just let himself go. I almost choked in surprise.

Lisa clapped her hands behind me. I had almost forgotten she was there.

""What a wonderful way to start the day"" Lisa applauded. ""You can do me next.""

I turned to look at her.

""Just kidding, I don't have time right now"" Lisa smiled at me.

I would assume she was joking if not for yesterdays anal.

""I am going shopping after work"" Lisa moved on, ""did you want me to grab anything for supper?""

I didn't know Lisa was staying for supper and gave her a bit of a confused look. However, I was still on my knees with cum in my mouth, so it was hard to argue with anyone right now.

""Don't worry, I will think of something."" She grabbed her clothes from the pile on the floor and started to get dressed.

""Jen, I need a t-shirt, mine is a bit sweaty from yesterday"" Lisa said to me.

I went into the bedroom and grabbed her one of mine.

""Thanks"" She said, ""Careful how you wash this one, I don't it to shrink.""

Lisa handed me her t-short from the day before along with her panties.

""Guess I am going commando today, borrowing a t-shirt is one thing"" she winked at me.

""OK, see you later"" and with that she was out the door.

I felt like a whirlwind had just passed by. Tossing the clothes into the hamper in our room, I started to clean up breakfast. With the dishwasher set, I went to the bedroom to get dressed.

As I entered the bedroom the sight made me pause. Chris had Lisa's panties from the hamper and giving them a sniff.

I made a noise, so he knew he was caught. It didn't seem to phase him.

""You two smell differently"" he remarked, ""Both like pussy, but in your own distinct way.""

""Of course!"" I answered a little puzzled. ""Same for men""

""I guess so"" Chris went on with the panties still in his hand. He then walked over to me and pushed his finger between my legs. Luckily, sucking him this morning had given me a bit of a buzz and he was able to get his finger in my easily.

He sniffed his finger and then sniffed the panties.

""Hmmm"" was all he said.

He then licked the panties and then his finger. Nodding his head, he tossed the panties into the hamper again.

Soon he was dressed and off to work.

I called in sick, not because I was, but we had made the place a bit of a mess and hadn't gotten any chores done. I hated having a messy place.

The rainy day passed by as I vacuumed, dusted, and changed the sheets. As I started the laundry, I thought about my interaction with Chris this morning. I picked up Lisa' s panties and looked at them. Without much thought I brought them to my nose and sniffed them.

They smelled like Lisa. I don't know why, but I tried the same experiment Chris had and slid my finger into my own vagina and compared.

I quickly put everything in the wash and move on in my day.

That evening was quiet. Lisa arrived after work, she had brought a bag with her, tossing it in the bedroom without saying anything. I assumed she was planning on spending the night again.

We didn't get up to much, watched TV and I made a simple dinner. Lisa seemed a little more quiet than usual. Chris pointed it out and she told us she was just a little tired.

We called it an early night and the three of us retired to bed.

The following morning, I made coffee as usual. It was then Lisa mentioned she wasn't feeling too well. She was going to take the day off work.

""Don't worry, Jen is going to take care of me today."" Lisa said as if we had already discussed it.

I had already taken yesterday off work; guess I was calling in again today.

Lisa set herself up on the couch with a pillow and blanket. I spent the day tidying around her and making her fresh cups of clear soup, tea or hot chocolate.

By mid-afternoon she was feeling a bit better and went for a shower. Coming out she lay her towel along the couch and lay down on it to dry off.

""Be a dear,"" She asked me, ""come and rub my back. Whatever bug got hold of me made all my muscles sore.""

I sat next to her and started to massage her shoulders. Soon I was standing over her and working out the knots. My technique was probably amateurish, but I have been told I give half decent massages. I worked my way down her back. When I had finished with her lower back I asked her how I was doing.

""Bum too please."" Lisa asked matter-of-factly.

The glutinous maximus was one of the largest muscles and from personal experience I knew who good it felt to get those muscles properly relaxed. I started with my fists and soon worked my fingered in like I was kneading bread.

""Fuck, that's good!"" Lisa explained.

I felt a touch of pride, being able to make someone feel this good. I carried on down her legs and worked on her feet.

""Just a minute!"" Lisa said, jumping up and leaving the room.

She returned with a bottle of baby oil from the bathroom and something else in her hand.

""I love having my feet massaged,"" Lisa smiled at me, ""sends tingles all over me.""

Laying back down, this time face up, I sat at the end of the couch with Lisa's feet in my lap. Pouring some baby oil into my hands I continued rubbing and massaging her feet. Stretched out beside me was Lisa's naked body. It was really the first time I had to look her over.

Her breasts where well shaped and, even on her back, they stayed mostly in place. I wondered if she had any work done, but I couldn't see any telltale scares. Her bush was full, but nicely trimmed. I could easily make out her lips below the thatch. She was what you might call an innie, not much of her inner lips protruded past our outer lips. Her legs were well shaped, and they stretched down to small ankles and pretty feet.

""Oh wow,"" Lisa brought me back from my daydreaming, ""I could have you do this all day.""

It was then I saw what was in her hand. She had brought out the little pink vibrator she had bought during our shopping trip.

She scooted down a little, leaving her feet in my lap but now opening her legs a little. She moved the little vibrator around her outer lips bring the area to life.

""You don't mind, do you?"" She asked, ""This is just an incredible way to relax.""

I minutely shook my head and kept staring. Her head was slightly tilted back and her eyes were closed.

""Keep doing my feet please,"" Lisa moaned, ""it feels wonderful.""

I hadn't realized I had stopped, and her plea knocked me back from my intense staring. Returning to her feet, I used my thumbs to work the oil around her foot and into the instep. My pinky opened up the space between her toes and grasped each toe and gently pushed it back to stretch out the tendent.

Lisa was still working the vibrator around her lips and occasionally sliding it inside. My own breathing was becoming more pronounced. I was fascinated, every move of the little pink toy I could feel on myself by proxy.

She then took the hand I had closest to her and gently placed it just above her mound.

""Push here slightly."" She commanded, ""It helps increase the pressure.""

Doing as I was told; I placed the palm of my hand across her neatly trimmed bush and applied a light pressure.

""Perfect!"" She moaned.

My other hand kept working on her toes and the soles of her feet.

Lisa's moans soon became more deliberate.

""Lend a sister your finger, won't you."" Lisa asked.

I turned and slid my middle finger inside her. She was so slippery. I quickly added another finger and received an approval moan.

""In and out,"" Lisa went on, ""pull the tips across the top wall.""

I did as I was told and applied pressure to her G-spot as I moved my fingers in and out of her.

""Oh honey,"" Lisa moaned, ""You are hitting all the right spots.""

Lisa was now flexing her hips to meet my thrusts. Her other hand came up and squeezed her breast.

I felt the first contractions start around my fingers and soon her orgasm washed over her. She held the vibrator tight against her clitoris and shook.

Soon she lay back and panted.

""Thank you,"" she started, ""thank you, I feel so much better. I will make sure to tell Chris you have been such a good girl for me today.""

I didn't know what to make of that last comment. Not sure I wanted Chris to know what we had been up to while he was at work. Then there was the 'good girl' part, it sounded condescending.

""Maybe we should keep this to ourselves."" I offered.

""Lie to Chris?"" Lisa mocked a shock expression, ""Bad girl! If you are sure, we can keep this from Chris.""

Suddenly, I felt I had just crossed a line. It wasn't so much I wanted to hide anything from Chris, I just didn't want him knowing. It wasn't the same thing, was it?

""We better get cleaned up before he gets home then."" Lisa said, jumping up, she gave me a kiss on the lips and left to get dressed.

Part of wanted to get off as well, but I was left clean up the couch. When I was done, Lisa re-appeared in a short skirt and loose-fitting top. It was easy to tell she had skipped the bra.

She came over to me and gave me a big hug.

""I feel so much better than I did this morning."" Lisa playfully announced, ""Thank you, you have really helped me feel better. I can't wait for Chris to fuck me tonight. Your fingers were nice, but they don't really replace a hard cock, do they?""

It was in this moment I realized I was no longer in control in any way. Sure, I knew Lisa had been pushing me around the last few days, but announcing she was going to fuck Chris, I knew that was a statement. I was no longer giving any permission. She was going to fuck Chris regardless of if I said it was fine or not. I could dig in my heels, but I thought that would just upset Chris and probably wouldn't work out in my favour.

I couldn't upset Chris; I wanted him to be happy. If he wanted to fuck the beautiful body, I had spent the afternoon staring at, I didn't want to get in his way.

Lisa put on same lively music, and we set about making supper. She seemed to be in a good mood and danced around me the entire time. At times she would come up behind me and shake my tits in time to the music. Other times she would slap my ass as a song's crescendo.

When Chris came in the door I walked over and gave him our traditional quick kiss to welcome him home. Lisa stepped up after I was finished and kissed him as well. Her kiss was different, it was a lover's kiss, deep and soul searching. Chris shot a glance over to me and I just smiled back. He looked happy.

Lisa whispered something into his ear and he smiled. It wasn't until later I learned she had whispered that she wasn't wearing any panties.

We ate dinner and heard about Chris' day without sharing to much of ours. Once we had finished Lisa moved around the table and sat on Chris' lap.

""I have been needing a fuck most of the day,"" Lisa told him flatly, ""Jen has been good company, but she doesn't have a cock. Don't bother warming me up, I am ready to go now.""

Lisa moved around to the back of her chair and pulled up her skirt. ""See, no panties!"" She reminded him.

She leaned over and gripped the chair waiting for him.

""Don't worry about the dishes, Jen will get those."" She looked at me, ""Right honey!""

There was something so raw and vulgar about what she was doing. Like watching someone masturbate on the subway. Chris moved in behind and pushed his way in to a grunt from Lisa.

I started to gather the dishes like this was all normal.

""Christ you're big!"" Lisa panted as he pounded his cock into her. ""Almost painful, but I love it.""

This just heightened Chris' lust and he thrusted harder and faster.

""Jen, I think he is going to cum soon!"" Lisa called out to me, ""Swallow it for me please.""

Lisa waved me over and obediently I got on my knees beside them.

""You can tell it turns him on,"" Lisa told me, ""I just felt his cock get a little bigger, if that were possible.""

By now I was getting used to another woman's smell and taste on Chris' cock, so it wasn't a surprise when he pulled out and pushed into my mouth. Instantly, he started to cum. I wasn't really ready and almost choked. He grabbed my hair and pushed deeper than he had ever done before. For a moment I thought I might pass out. Just as I started to panic he pulled back and a moment later withdrew from my mouth.

""WOW!"" was all he could say.

""Let's get some drinks and go sit in the living room."" Said Lisa, as if he hadn't just been pounding her or exploded into my mouth.

""Well done!"" Lisa whispered to me, ""I could see him pushing down your throat.""

I stood up a little wobbly from the experience. The entire encounter had me a little off centre. I was horny, frustrated and feeling a little abused.

When I got to the living room, Chris was sitting at one end of the couch and Lisa was next to him with her legs stretched out. The only place for me, if I wanted to be near Chris, was on the floor in front of them where I could lay my head against his knee.

I was worked up in a way I hadn't been before. I tried squeezing my legs together to help, but it only made things worse. I was full on horny but to embarrassed to do anything about it. Chris probably wasn't ready to do anything else just yet and going to my room to masturbate seemed juvenile. I would need to wait it out.

Chris leaned down and stroked my hair. For a moment I felt like the family dog. My needs would have to wait. If we didn't get up to anything else, I would find time later to get myself off. For now I was just happy Chris was content.",,2025-08-15T19:10:42.287741,3441,

Please start reading this series from the first chapter.

Thank you very much to those who have left encouraging and helpful messages. These are really appreciated showing that somebody is reading my scribblings.

To date:

John Smith had an injection of contaminated testosterone, causing his cock and balls to permanently enlarge. He now needs frequent sex to survive, and long term friends Sophia, Janet and Adriana; his old girl friend Glenda; co-workers Bronwyn and Paula; his specialist doctor Philipa and nurse Polly agree to help. John has come to terms with having sex with other women, although they still amaze him with their willingness. They have to deal with the pharmaceutical company as it tries to get out of being held responsible. John is helped by another sufferer from the injection, Matt, who is a computer security specialist and private investigator.

All sex participants are 18 years or older.

All people, activities and anything resembling facts are a figment of my imagination, and may not match anything in real life.

Biology and medicine are not my strongest points and sex is just a hobby, so I have not been encumbered by any silly preconceptions.

Expect some ridiculous ideas as I alter reality to fit my perception of life.

You possibly will not find any major new ideas. I read a lot and it is hard to know if I have any originality at all, or if am I just regurgitating stuff. I like to think I have my own twist which stops me feeling guilty. My apologies if I have used something, it was not intended.

Yes, if it does look like a harem story, this is because it is one. If this genre does not interest you then read no further.

Tuesday day 30.

John took his coffee out to the backyard where he could sit in peace and quiet. Being a normal work day there was little noise in the neighbourhood apart from the occasional car on the road. Sophia came out to give him a quick hug and kiss before she left for work. Linda soon joined him with a fresh pot of coffee and they sat allowing their thoughts to wander. They stayed there longer than anticipated as the twins could be now heard inside the house. The girls wandered outside to say good morning to the couple and give them a quick hug before returning to the kitchen for breakfast.

John held Linda's hand as he contemplated how to bring up a topic that had been on his mind for a while, ""Linda, I've been giving this some thought recently.""

""That's good dear. I wondered about the strained expression on your face.""

John ignored her morning humour and continued, ""Before you have us rolling on the floor laughing, I will say this so you can give it some thought as well,"" Linda looked at him without commenting sensing he was serious, ""This health of mine is seriously impinging on any sort of normal life I could try as I need to frequently stop what I am doing for my treatments. I was wondering about the business and my working life. It is most likely that my continuing to run the business could cause more damage than good. I mean, how would it be if I was in the middle of a very important meeting with clients and they have to wait so I can dash out to get some treatment. This would be even worse if the meeting was at a client's office. I would need to take someone with me in case of emergency.""

Linda agreed that could get a little embarrassing, ""Yes dear it would get interesting if during the meeting you announced that your tingles were bothering you making it hard to concentrate properly. So your companion for the day would have to get under the table to give you a nice long blow job so you could continue with the meeting. Then you would just blow it down her throat, or before blowing your lid she would have to get undressed and sit on your lap so you could cum inside her. I am sure the clients would not be concerned with what you need to do. Better yet you could get her to strip and lean over the table and mount her from behind. She could even hold your papers up so you could read them and she would be in the perfect position to take notes as well.""

John chuckled at the idea of this happening as he pictured Paula trying to get all six feet five of herself underneath the boardroom table, or taking notes as he pummelled her from behind over the table. Perhaps Bronwyn would be better, she is probably short enough to have her sit on his lap and nobody would even notice unless one of her boobs flew up and landed on the table edge. He chuckled a bit more to himself as he told himself off for his non politically-correct humour.

Linda then said, ""Thinking about it, your treatment with a colleague might bother some of your fuddy-duddy clients. You should take Polly and Philipa with you, much better and more professional to have your doctor and nurse to give you treatment as required. Even your most conventional clients could not complain when your personal doctor and nurse have to give you a blow job during the meeting, then jack you off to get your cum all over their faces and chests. Then both of them would get on the table while you,"" John interrupted her at this point with his laughter.

""Thank you dear, I get the message. I do however think it best to try and avoid the need for in-meeting sex. I would not know how best to include it in the agenda or record it in the minutes. Although seeing Philipa and Polly in some sexy uniforms would be a hoot just to see some of the faces when we walk in,"" and they both took a break from talking to laugh.

He then continued talking, ""Returning to my real topic, I was considering whether to officially pull back from the business.""

Linda asked, ""Do you mean sell the company and retire?""

""Well that would be an option, but I wouldn't like to do that as it leave my crew open to being dumped. I have had offers for the business as you know, but they have really just wanted to gain my market share. They also think it would give them free access to the patents which are worth far more than the company alone.""

""So what exactly are you suggesting?""

""I am not totally certain, but I think I need to get to the point of not needing to be at the office all the time. Let someone else run it and we either retain ownership or I was thinking that perhaps a partial sale. Like issuing shares in the company to staff and they all have part ownership. We keep most between us but they would have a large part in the direction and also gain from the profitability. I had not decided whether to sell them the shares, or just issue them as a bonus. But either way it would relieve me of a lot of stress and give me more time to sort out my life.""

""I think that is a fantastic idea honey. I had been thinking along the same lines myself but not as far along as you. I am basically a one woman business so it is easier to stop working. I would only have to stop taking new work and it would eventually dry up as projects were completed. This would be even quickly done now as I have already handed over the ongoing work to the people I share the work office with. I was thinking that with a baby on the way as well as your health I needed to be more available for you and also be careful because of the pregnancy. Then after bubs is born I want to be a stay-at-home mum, so I would stop working regardless.""

At the mention of their impending parenthood both parents-to-be got emotional and the discussion stopped for a while. They sat in silence holding hands feeling the close link between them. It was then that Linda received a shock as her stomach began rebelling. She had to rush to the toilet getting there just in time to let everything up and out. John followed her getting more worried as he could hear her distressed sounds. Sound travels very well through a house, especially noises you would prefer remain just in the toilet room. The twins rushed to join John looking a little distraught themselves. John was still very worried and got a little cross at Kim and Sal when they shared a look and started giggling.

They saw he was about to speak when Sal spoke first, ""John I think your wife is pregnant. Mum told us this might happen in the early days and we looked it up on-line. It's called morning sickness and is quite normal, even if it doesn't sound too good,"" this last part with another giggle.

A voice from the little room said, ""Very funny, very funny. It doesn't feel too good from this side either. Now go away everyone and let me die in peace. Love you all, but go away.""

Three voices called out, ""Bye bye"" as Linda returned to feeling miserable, this time by herself.

It was by now close to mid morning and John was feeling concerned. He needed to get some treatment soon and from the way Linda was feeling he was loath to ask her. He wandered around the back yard for a while and eventually found himself in his own yard where he noticed the cleaners at work. Trying to keep his mind off his tingles until he had a solution he entered his home to find they were nearly completed. The head cleaner told him they would be all done soon and the boss would be out for final inspection before lunch. John thanked them and returned to Sophia's house to let Linda know the good news to find her curled up in bed feeling very sorry for herself. As he was letting her know they could have their home back after lunch she let him know she was happy with the news and also that she should be feeling a bit better before then. He was leaving her to rest some more when she waved to him to return to the bed.

""John, tonight we are starting the new roster, but for now Bronwyn will be waiting for you at her place. Go now and see you lunch time. Love you.""

""Love you too sweetheart. Get better quick.""

He kissed her on the forehead and left the house. The twins heard him leaving and rushed to say bye and that they would keep an eye on Linda. Thanking them he left, calling Bronwyn as he drove off to double check she knew he was coming. She was, he went and they did. He made it in time to stem the worsening of his tingles. They had gotten to the stage of being painful so he was glad to not require anything more urgent than a quick climax to begin with. Bronwyn would not accept his apologies for getting straight to business when he entered her apartment. She didn't like to tell him that she really enjoyed him using her like that.

The second round was a bit more gentle and although she liked a quickie the slow and loving always produced greater orgasms. Having time to build up to it paid handsome dividends. She was so tight and sensitive that a single orgasm probably was a combination of many peaks ending in a big one. Bronwyn loved the way he used her like this even though it entailed love on both their parts, it gave her a feeling that for the first time she was really needed by someone. She was important and could do something for another person that they needed and appreciated. Of course getting multiple orgasms was a very suitable reward for her effort.

She had taken the rest of the day off and went with John to help them move back in. It would also give her a chance to stake a claim on a room for herself, something that she was really looking forward to. All her gear was packed and ready to go. Most was in her own car with some going into John's. Before leaving he talked about Linda feeling unwell and they decided that Janet might be able to join them later. John felt better about her taking time off work than Sophia as he paid Janet's wages anyway. Sophia would have come home without a second thought but he felt she shouldn't take time off just for them.

John arrived in time to meet the main exterminator contractor as he was completing his final inspection. He took John around the house to get his okay for the work. It all looked good to John and he was even delighted that the cleaners had laundered all the main linen items so the beds would just need making and towels placed. Bronwyn had gone straight to see Linda, and John found them in the kitchen preparing lunch. Linda was looking better and stated how much better she felt, although eating lunch may be too much to bear. John then noticed that Linda was standing well away from the food area as Bronwyn organised everything. Soon the twins arrived from their studies to help with the final preparations, full of energy and chatted with Bronwyn.

John let Linda know that Janet would be over later this afternoon as soon as she could get off work. Linda perked up a bit and went off to ring Janet to organise some things for the day. She also rang Sophia to fill her in that Bronwyn and Janet were here to help. The others ate lunch while she was on the phone and managed to clean the kitchen before she returned.

Now that it was time to move back home, Linda went into boss mode. She organised everyone to grab something from the bedroom and frog marched them next door to her own house. With so many hands it was done in one trip. Then each was given a task in the house to get it ready to live in. Dishes were checked and cleaned, spare linen not stored in the main linen press were put into the washing machine. Beds were made and bathrooms stocked with towels and necessary items. John retrieved the bug detector gadget and went from room to room to ensure their privacy. Fortunately all was clear and he breathed a sigh of relief.

By mid afternoon John was feeling the pinch and Janet had arrived to help. Linda raised her eyebrows to John and he nodded in response. She then called the twins to head back home to clean the spare bedroom that had been used. They were to change the bedding and put the sheets in the wash.

Linda made the sisters curious when she turned to Bronwyn and asked, ""Bronwyn, could you go with the girls to help them. I think it will take about an hour and Janet can stay here to give John a hand. That should be enough time to make the main bed.""

Bronwyn smiled as Linda's real message was clear, ""No problems Linda, I can do that although I would prefer to stay and give him a hand myself,"" knowing that it really meant, '

keep the twins at home for at least an hour to give Janet a chance to give John his treatment

'.

Janet and John were chuckling as they went upstairs to the main bedroom and proceeded with the bed making. They managed to get the bottom sheet over the mattress and tucked in when Linda appeared in the doorway holding a couple of towels.

""Girls are gone, door is locked and tingles are running,"" They laughed at her comment as John went to her and gave her a hug and kiss, soon joined by Janet who was still giggling.

The kisses and then hug soon turned from Linda to Janet allowing Linda to get the towels onto the bed. She made an impatient sound seeing the other two still standing where she had left them, causing them to separate like two naughty teens caught kissing. From that moment it took very little time for them to undress and get on the bed. As they were settling Janet sat up quickly looking around her.

She said, ""Gosh, it looked big before but now I am here it seems so much bigger. I mean, there are three of us on the bed and it doesn't feel at all crowded. What size is it?""

Linda answered, ""It's about eight foot by seven. I thought we might need something a bit more suitable than our old normal bed. It was, after all, only king size. It was harder finding the bed linen to go with it, although the shop I got it from could supply it, they wanted an arm and a leg for it.""

John said, ""I like the extra room even though we seem to be bunched up to one side at the moment,"" and he checked the bottom for room around his feet and smiled as he added, ""I can see even Paula could fit with inches to spare. I think this will make sleeping more comfortable having a little more space to stretch. The mattress is also comfortable.""

Janet giggled and spoke, ""Okay, enough. I need filling up, and unless there is another bloke here ready to go, get to it John.""

John and Linda laughed at the orders as John pulled Janet close to him and wrestled her into position to kiss her. He then made his way slowly down her body giving her nipples a tongue-lashing lip-sucking workout much to Janet's liking. She started moaning when he arrived at to her pussy and added licking and munching to the lashing and sucking. Her climax had juices flowing to his delight as he slurped up what he could, the excess running down his chin.

Janet was becoming sensitive so she pulled his head away from her pussy to get his cock into action. It did not take long for him to be inserted and lunging as Janet rolled her hips in time with him. Being vocal during sex had become the norm as the sensations overcame any inhibitions for silence. The sounds from the participants buoyed Linda to greater excitement. She could feel the bed moving under her body, held a hand to his butt to feel muscles flexing, her eyes followed the physical coupling and the emotions through the couple's expressions. All this sensual input made the noise of their love making like that of surround sound in an action movie as she felt it beat all the way to her heart. It had become a total experience for her. Thus when the couple reached their peaks she was right there with them enjoying her own orgasm.

Instead of removing his cock from her vagina Janet rolled them over so she was now on top keeping him embedded within her. They now rested to ease their breathing and heart rates. Janet was basking in the joy of being with John, it was wonderful for her spirit to be able to be honest and show her affection and attraction for him. Being in public with him she found it difficult to stand back, to treat him as her boss or just a friend and not throw her arms around him. But like this, in private, she can let herself go and treat herself to his physical and emotional presence.

Janet soon calmed down enough to start anew. Even his spunk leaking out of her vagina did not deter her from reaching her destination. She wanted, even needed him to release another hot load into her. She could feel his cock pushing into her forcing her to stretch the sheath around him. His cum adding lubrication for their rubbing skin. As Janet's thoughts centered on his cock inside of her she sped up her efforts knowing he needed to release more. Her breathing quickened in time with her hips not noticing John's breathing or jerky movements as he tried to keep up with her. She opened her eyes to watch him as his face screwed in what could have been pain. Then he relaxed totally as his orgasm peaked and he arched his back to get as far into her as possible. His orgasm enlarged his cock sending the sensations in her vagina into overdrive forcing a large orgasm from within her. While John was grunting heavily with his thrusts Janet screamed as her won climax ripped through her making her feel she was being turned inside out. Neither noticed Linda moan as her climax sent her soaring as a companion to them.

Janet collapsed onto John panting trying to get enough oxygen into her body. She wasn't the only one out of breath, although Linda recovered first having expended more mental than physical energy. It took the joined pair a while longer to breathe easily and separate their hips. Linda was waiting with towels at the ready for the overflowing fluids she knew would go everywhere. She covered Janet's crutch with the towel but used her mouth to catch any spillage from John's deflating cock. If he hadn't already been so spent this would have had him ready for another round.

Before leaving them Linda gave John a loving long kiss followed by another loving kiss to Janet who automatically responded to a pair of lips pressed to her own. Nobody paid any attention to what Linda had done as it seemed a natural thing to do. They soon left the bed to clean up in the bathroom and dressed themselves just in time as there was knocking on the back door. Linda scooted down to unlock it apologising to the girls for unwittingly locked it by reflex. She got strange looks from the twins after that statement and a knowing grin from Bronwyn.",,2025-08-15T19:11:15.880224,3758,

""Alright Nia, I, um, will!""

Caught by surprise by her wife's request, Kristin momentarily couldn't think of

what

to do! Scrambling, she

yanked

herself out of Lori's hold - the brunette's hand immediately grabbing her other thigh - and laid flat on the bed. Mimicking Lori's position, she stretched legs apart as much as possible, her so-called

friend's

body blocking her path. ReIn her nearly

uncontrollable

aroused state, Nia's sack and balls had only

grown

. The sparsely-haired, wrinkled scrotum now

encompassed

the futa's own knees like she was holding a purse below her groin - a purse filled with

watermelons

. Denied their release, Nia's cum factories expanded more than Kristin had ever seen them - except for when she'd walked in on her with Lori - utterly

obese

with brewed-up baby batter. Like they were oft to do, they shook and

groaned

against each other, announcing their urgent desire to seed and

breed

anyone that they could.

Emanating off of Nia's combined, below-the-belt mass was the same aroma that had already invaded Kristin's olfactory senses. Now, however, it was an even

more

powerful form of the familiar musk, the same kind Kristin had

tasted

during her wife and Lori's first impregnation session. She felt like she could practically

see

the steaming tendrils of Nia's scent waft through the room, the air hotter and

heavier

than when they first entered; it caressed Kristin's body, sending tingles through her skin, her pussy growing

wetter

as she was surrounded by the potent miasma. Her tongue involuntarily hung out of her mouth like it wanted to

lick

the stench.

All of this belonged to the person Kristin cared about more than anyone else in existence - and all of it would be used on someone

other

than her. As entranced as she was by her wife's unyielding virility, the depressing thoughts of what was to come

next

weren't able to depart her brain; she hoped, at the very least, that Lori wouldn't be so fucking

smug

while getting fucked! She just had to repeat silently to herself that Nia was doing this for

her

, and that nothing would be different between them when all was said and done.

God

how she wanted that to be the truth!

""I can

see

that,"" Lori continued their conversation after the long pause they partook in to revel at Nia's endowment, ""you're like a fucking

river

down there, girl!""

As if she needed to

prove

her words, Lori shot her hand out and

cupped

Kristin's sex, causing the busty blonde to squeal and flinch. Seemingly as skillful she was at handling

pussy

as she was cock, Lori's fingers deftly toyed with Kristin's engorged, pink folds, caressing and rubbing them in a way that brought her nothing but

shameful

pleasure. Lori used a single digit to circle Kristin's tiny clit, coaxing it from its hood, her others gently rubbing down the middle of her slit, not quite

penetrating

her canal yet.

""Damn Kris, you're fuckin' soaked! I'm surprised you can't take your wife's cock!""

Without asking permission, Lori

sunk

one of her stubby fingers into Kristin's pussy, forcing it between her drenched lower lips; the blonde moaned and

bucked

against her friend's palm, unable to help herself. Kristin's cunt

clamped

down on the digit which wiggled back and forth inside of it and explored her inner-walls, Lori sliding it towards her pleasure spot. Lori didn't apparently

need

to add any more, Kristin's sex vice-like in its tightness - something the voluptuous woman realized to her intense embarrassment. But it wasn't like she was in the right mind to protest, the combination of her wife's

presence

and her friend's expert ministrations strong enough to cloud her mind.

Kristin turned her gaze to her wife as she was fingered like a pornstar in front of her, trying to see how Nia was reacting to all of this; as expected, the futa was

enthralled

by lurid performance. Her hands were on her cock, stroking it slowly,

pushing

more pre out of it onto the bed next to Kristin and Lori. Nia's bottom lip was folded into her mouth, her front teeth biting it hard enough to nearly draw

blood

. This helped make Kristin feel better about being treated like such a wanton

whore

, the knowledge that her significant other was enjoying it enough to her bear the euphoric humiliation.

Lori continued to shove her finger in and out of her companion's hole, playing with her clit all the while and Kristin knew

exactly

what she was trying to do: make her climax! And, to her agonizing mortification, she was

ready

to let Lori accomplish her goal; she tried to justify it by thinking to herself that it was for

Nia's

enjoyment more so than her own. The orgasm came quickly, Kristin howling as her pussy clenched hard enough it was like it was trying to

tear

her friend's digit off, a thin stream of clear fluid shooting from her cunt and splattering against Lori's thigh. Her figure shook and wobbled as she rode out the intense ecstasy.

Before Kristin could fully recover, Lori removed her finger.

""Jesus girl you

are

tight!"" Lori laughed, holding up her hand to show off just how

saturated

it was with the blonde's juices, ""No wonder Nia can't fuck you! I've been with a few women, and

none

of them were as tight as you - or as

easy

to get off. Like, good for you Kris!""

""T-Thanks, L-Lor',"" Kristin managed to stutter, not really

hearing

what her friend said to her, ""Glad you, um, think so.""

""Now

me

, on the other hand... like I have the

perfect

pussy to take such a massive dick!""

Leaning backward on the bed, Lori spread her pasty legs and presented herself to Nia's watchful - and Kristin's

hazy

- gaze. Like her counterpart's sex, Lori's pussy was

dripping

with her own feminine arousal, a small puddle of her own gooey secretions formed under her bubbly behind - but that's where the similarities ended. Lori's cunt was hairy, fat, and

gaped

open without anything actually stretching it, the complete opposite of Kristin's virginal-looking slit. It was something

incredulous

to even look at, obscene and clearly well-used in every way a woman's vagina

could

be.

As if she was trying to show off just how

experienced

she was, Lori snaked a hand between her chubby thighs, brushing her fingers through her glistening bush and over her, frankly,

huge

clit; the brunette paused to tweak the long pink nub, literally

twisting

it like it was a nipple instead. The moan that escaped Lori's lips while she played with herself was of the deep

throaty

variety, one that betrayed just how

much

her exhibitionist act was getting her off. During the time she spent bopping and

yanking

on her clit, Lori's cunt

gushed

with her juices, the frothy liquid streaming down the sheets.

After, she moved her hand to her cunt, and, without any further self-administered foreplay, she

shoved

four of her fingers straight between her loose, saggy folds; Kristin

gawked

at the massive insertion that Lori carried out on herself with such ridiculous proficiency, the brunette scarcely making a single sound as she did. Kristin looked over to Nia to gauge her reaction, but what she saw was

not

what she expected! Nia's expression hadn't changed in the slightest, no looks of awe - or as Kristin hoped to find -

disgust

visible on her features. She was acting like this was par for the course!

Kristin's attention was drawn back to Lori by what sounded like someone

beating

eggs with a whisk - and that's almost what the brunette was doing! With her four fingers inserted as deeply as possible into her cunt, her thumb pressed down on her clitoris at the same time, Lori was

churning

up her depths with her digits, rotating her wrist as fast as she could. Specks of juices splattered across her arm, thighs, and the bed almost like she was

splashing

her palm into a pool of water. Lori's moans increased in volume as she literally

whipped

herself into a lurid frenzy.

Before Kristin's very eyes, Lori folded her thumb against her palm and then proceeded to

punch

her entire hand into her cunt. She was fucking

fisting

herself! There wasn't a way for Kristin to describe her horror as she watched her friend

lunge

her fist up to her wrist in and out of her pussy, her saggy labia

gripping

the limb as it rocketed through it. Lori threw her head back and

screamed

, reaching climax from the sensation of brutalizing her own sex; the quantity of girl cum that exploded from her gaped hole put Kristin's volume to shame,

multiple

simultaneous squirts jettisoning from around her fist in every direction, each one long in both duration

and

length, her orgasm lasting for nearly

half

a minute.

What the fuck was

wrong

with her!?

""Ooooh shit that was good!"" Lori panted, raising her head and giving Nia and Kristin a goofy grin, her forehead beaded with sweat, ""I swear to God Nia, after you fucked me this is the

only

way I can get off! I had to buy bigger toys just to like,

try

and feel as good as your cock does. I don't think I can go back to normal dicks ever again!""

""I-I'm sorry?"" Nia apologized, unsure if it was needed or not, ""I didn't mean to erm,

do

that to you.""

""Sorry!? Baby I should be

thanking

you! If I knew a cock that big was out there, I wouldn't have wasted my time with so many small-time, limp-dicked guys! From now on this pussy is for futa cock

only

!""

She turned to Kristin.

""Christ Kris, you don't know what you're missing!"" She half-boasted, half-prodded, her grin switching from goofy to

derisive

, ""You should be fucking Nia here as much as you can. Hell, if I was you, I'd like, do

anything

I could to try and take her!""

""We- I have..."" Kristin averted her gaze, her sorrow and shame on full display for the first time that day, ""Nothing has worked and I, I want

nothing

more than to have sex with Nia.""

""Kristin, don't worry about it. I've told you befo-""

""Then you haven't tried hard

enough

obviously!"" Lori interrupted, cutting off any sympathy-talk before it began, ""Oh well, that just means for me!""

Scooting herself forward through her own lake of juices - and bumping Kristin out of the way in the process - Lori centered herself in the center of the bed, right

below

Nia's massive, swaying cock. She spread her legs into a split, stretching her slovenly sex out in the process, once more

flaunting

herself to the futa. Before Kristin understood what was happening, one of Lori's flabby arms slid under her waist and she was suddenly

forced

into the brunette's side, her huge tits

clapping

onto Lori's tiny pair. Lori plunged her neck out and kissed Kristin like she had when they were alone together, making out with her for

everyone's

enjoyment.

""Ready?"" Lori smiled at Kristin, their lips only inches apart, ""Ready to see your future

child

be made?""

Lori stopped and laughed.

""Who am I kidding? You're gonna end up with a

bunch

of babies after today!""

""Um, well, actually I thin-""

""And what about

you

, Nia?"" Kristin's protests went ignored once again, ""Ready to

breed

me like the fucking stud you are!?""

""I am, but I had a thought."" Nia nodded and began angling her cock down to meet Lori's cunt, ""A thought about how this can go.""

""O-Oh...?""

Lori and Kristin were both confused.

""I wanted to still have sex with you, Lori, as planned, but cumming inside of Kristin when the time comes instead. Chances are I'll orgasm inside of you anyway, but this might be a

different

solution to the troubles we're having. I don't think we've ever tried it before, but I figured it would be worth a shot. That way you

both

have a chance at getting pregnant.""

Kristin's face lit up and Lori's darkened.

Yes! Her wife was so gorgeous and smart and

good

to her! While Kristin didn't

relish

having Nia's cock inside of her after it was in Lori first, this was still a

brilliant

idea! Though they'd care for and take-in any babies Lori might end up having as they originally agreed, the fact that this was

her

best chance at getting pregnant made her heart

leap

with glee; the fact that Lori obviously

hated

the new plan was just the icing on the cake. Even if it

didn't

work, she and Nia could try on their own in the future

without

Lori's aid - or

interference

as Kristin was considering it more and more - and she would finally get to be a mommy!

She couldn't believe she'd never thought of it before! It wasn't like she had trouble getting Nia off with her tits and mouth and such, so there was no reason she

couldn't

have just cum inside of her without having sex to reach orgasm first; Kristin did

frown

a bit at this simple concept, wondering why they'd never considered it until now - but at least her amazing wife

had

in the end! Kristin now hoped that Lori

didn't

get pregnant today, and that she'd never have to see again so that life could return to normal, armed with knowledge she didn't possess before.

Looking at Lori to study her reaction, Kristin was once more delighted to see her friend's despair-riddled expression. There was no doubt that the brunette wasn't a fan of the idea, but what was she going to say at this point? Was she going to reject Nia's proposal? Try to talk her out of it? She no longer had the advantage she did previously, the ball in the other court now. Kristin tried to hold back her glee, choosing to direct her elation towards her wife instead.

""Interesting..."" Lori muttered, her eyes narrowed at Nia, ""Well, I guess we'll see if it works! It would be like, super cool if Kris and I were pregnant at the same time! Okay, I'm on board!""

Damn, Kristin was hoping for a

different

response!

""Good,"" Nia let out a long sigh of relief, her posture relaxing, ""then let's do this.""

She paused and gave Kristin a long, focused stare.

""I love you, baby.""

""I love you too, Nia. More than anything.""

Nodding again, Nia adjusted her stance and lowered herself, bending her knees into a half-squat. Gripping her monumental cock, she finished bending it downwards to point it at Lori's pre-gaped cunt, inching herself forward until her glans were separated by a miniscule amount of space; as she did, she gave her shaft several lengthy strokes, coaxing more sperm from her balls. The extensive ropes shot out over Lori's pussy,

caking

it into an even

sloppier

mess, the brunette's obscene-looking sex masked under lays of gooey precum. Lori moaned and thrust her hips out, trying to get Kristin's wife's member inside of herself as soon as possible.

""Is... is

everyone

ready?""

""I-I think so, go ahea-""

""YES! Please fuck me Nia! I

need

that massive dick inside of me right

now

!""

Kristin flinched.

""Okay, here I go...""

With a last glance at her wife and a deep breath, Nia pushed her hips forward. The difference between how the initial penetration went between her and Lori compared to with Kristin was night and day. Where it took minute after minute for Nia to get the

tip

of her glans to fit into her wife, less than a single

second

passed before the whole, oversized head stuffed itself inside of Lori. Lori's not-so-delicate petals opened like a flower in bloom,

swallowing

the futa's cock like that's what they were

made

for, her reddened crown completely disappearing into the brunette's spacious hole. They both moaned loudly at this accomplishment.

Next to them, Kristin

forced

herself to watch this act of betrayal that wasn't

actually

betrayal, not wanting to show any more weakness in front of her wife and companion. Fighting back tears and her instinctual desire to

flee

, Kristin grabbed the soggy sheets around her and clutched them tightly to aid in her failing strength; what

wasn't

making this any easier was being able to feel how Lori was reacting to the sex. Still held tightly against her friend, Kristin was able to - through her giant tits resting atop Lori's chest - make out the brunette's rapidly beating heart, and the intense, arousal-formed

heat

emanating from her body.

She observed - after Nia got situated and calmed down slightly - her wife pushing herself

deeper

into Lori. And again, it was done with unheard of

ease

. Kristin didn't know if it was because of the fact that they'd already spent a day fucking

before

now or not, but Nia's elephantine appendage seemed to slip into Lori like it was no big deal for the brunette to take something so gigantic - more so than Kristin had ever considered possible until that moment! Already, the first inches of the futa's shaft were being consumed by Lori's starving sex, approaching the same depth that was usually the blonde's upper limit.

Staying

mostly

quiet through the lurid act so far - probably for her

own

benefit, Kristin considered - Nia only panted and exhaled loudly through her nose as she continued to drive her cock into the brunette. Lori had no such reservations. Kristin's extra-fertile friend was writhing and

howling

, jerking her hips back and forth to already

fuck

herself against the top of Nia's menacing pole, her hand that wasn't cradling Kristin hooked onto one of her thighs to pull it even

farther

back against her own body. She was acting the way the blonde had always

wished

she could when making love with her partner, her own reactions only generally made up of pained grunts and strained gasps.

""Yes Nia, yes!"" Lori half-screamed, her eyes glued to the point of penetration, ""Fucking

fuck

me with that huge cock! God fucking damnit, I can like,

already

feel myself cumming! Shit!""

True to her words, a new

gush

of her arousal spritz from her split cunt - as Kristin could very much

see

. Lori's previously-slack lower lips suddenly

tightened

around Nia's shaft - causing the futa to groan appreciatively - folding over her monumental member like they were giving it a

hug

. Her flooding fluids

soaked

Kristin's wife's cock, rivulets of it running down its incredible length, the puddle underneath them growing at the same time. Like before, Lori's climax lasted for seconds on end, spraying hard and wildly enough that some of it even hit

Kristin

.

Though she'd focused on her partner and friend having sex, there was a

new

aspect of the coupling that Kristin found herself drawn to - one she'd only seen once before, and not on

herself

at that. Something

other

than Lori's natural chub was bulging her stomach, and though the way it presented itself was unfamiliar, Kristin knew exactly what she was looking at. Nia's cock! She was so deep into Lori and her member was so ludicrously

enormous

that the outline of it had formed in the brunette's abdomen! Kristin noticed it when she accidentally saw them together the first time, but she'd just assumed it was something that only happened when Nia buried her cock fully into a person!",,2025-08-15T19:11:21.596967,3346,
https://www.literotica.com/s/donnas-mom,Donna's Mom,Unknown Author,,,,,"No one in this fictional story is under eighteen years old. There is some slight incest, sort of. There is anal, oral and mother-in-law sex in this story. It's a fantasy! Any similarity to any person living or dead or in-between is entirely ridiculous be nice in your comments, especially you anonymous! Over the top as usual. If you don't like it, then get off your dead ass and you write something!

Donna's Mom

She stood at the sink. She was short and fat, but truth be told, it was all in her big tits and ass. Her long auburn hair came from a bottle, but it was shiny and complemented her green eyes perfectly. Her waist and everything else about her was slender.

Her daughter had DDD size tits with huge sensitive nipples. I had gotten her off just by playing with them. I wondered, like mother, like daughter?

""Donna called just before you got here. She got stuck at work, she won't be home for at least three or four hours. She is getting time and a half, which is good I guess.""

""So it's you and me? You want me to go Mrs. Johnson?"" I asked her. She looked at the hot soapy water and dirty dishes. She was in thought.

""No, you can stay Mark. Please call me Marlene. I could use the company. Sometimes it gets lonely here.""

""It's funny, but I've been at parties with a hundred people, and I never felt so all alone."" I said.

""Me too! Some people behave almost like you're not even there."" She was using those yellow gloves to protect her hands from the hot water. I walked up behind her. I put my arms around her and cupped her huge breasts. Her nipples popped out right through bra, shirt and sweater. They were enormous, just like her daughter's. She moaned. I kissed her neck at her shoulder line. My erection was pushing through my pants and into the crack of her big fat beautiful ass. Skinny girls are great. Fat girls are so much better. Not that she was fat. She was shaped like a perfect hourglass, with huge tits up top, a very narrow waist, and a nice big bubble but. She was absolutely perfect! Her nipples just got harder still from my manipulations.

She moaned and I heard it. She was loving what I was doing, so I pinched and plucked and played with her nipples some more. This brought more happy moans!

""Mark! What are you doing? We can't do this! You are dating my daughter. I'm twice your age! I...I uhhhhh."" I was biting her neck gently, and squeezing the hell out of her tits. I twisted and tweaked her diamond hard nipples. ""Oh Mark!"" she sighed in a dream-like voice. She shuddered. Did she just cum?

""We can't...We shouldn't...MMMMMM, OHMYGOD MARK!"" I had spun her around and was kissing her hard on the mouth. Grabbed her and pulled her to me roughly. She was going to be mine!

I was going to rip open her shirt.

""Stop, you fucking animal!"" She looked in my eyes. I saw the lust that was there.

""I will unbutton it. It's silk, and it's expensive"" she just didn't want to destroy her nice shirt. Hey, I understand.

I played with her great ass while she s-l-o-w-l-y unbuttoned her fine silk blouse. I reached around front and felt her cleft. She was sopping wet. She moaned really loud that time. She was absolutely loving it.

""I'm going to fuck you Marlene."" I played with her mons through her slacks. She was completely soaked now. More loud moaning. She shivered. Did she come again? This woman was a firecracker!

""What about Donna?""She looked at me with wide open eyes.

""I...ok, truth time. She asked me if I thought you were sexy. I said very much so. She said since the divorce you have been very down, depressed even. She wanted me to make you feel better.""

""Make me feel better with sex?""

""Well...yes. But, uhh, can you keep a secret? I have wanted you for years and years. When I used to mow your lawn, and you would sun yourself out in back, I wanted you so bad. But I was just eighteen, I don't think you even remembered me from back then.""

""I remember a beautiful eighteen year old young man that I used to daydream about"" Marlene revealed. ""You were in my very naughtiest fantasies!"" she sighed.

""I think you are way sexier than your beautiful daughter. Please don't ever tell your daughter that. I certainly don't want to hurt her feelings. She expressly asked me to fuck you, good and hard. I want you so bad.""

Her hand touched my manhood through my pants. ""Geez Mark! You're hard as a rock! So you're telling me she asked you to do this?"" Marlene continued to touch my dick. She stroked my cock with purpose, almost posessively. She was fumbling with my zipper with her other hand.

""Yes, she did. But she doesn't know that I find you more attractive than her. Please Marlene, don't tell her. Spare her feelings. Ok?"" I was trying to unhook her damned bra. It had lots of hooks, and it felt very heavy duty.

""Ok. For a Casanova you have no idea how to open a bra? Let me unhook it.""

""I'm nervous. This damn bra of yours has so many hooks!"" I fumbled trying to undo her tit sling.

""It has a lot of weight to uphold. I have a secret too. When I was sunning myself, back in the day. I wanted you to take me. Just rip off my clothes and fuck me hard. My goodness, your dick is bigger than I remember it.""

I removed the in the way brassiere. I feasted on her big nipples, each like a cherry, with two large wrinkled areolas surrounding them. She moaned like she was in heat. She was in heat!

""When did you see my dick?""

""That time at Donna's birthday party, I walked in on you taking a piss. She was holding your big dick and pointing it in the toilet. I quickly turned around and left. I...I was jealous. I wanted to hold your dick. I would have let you piss on me too!""

""Wow, you are such a dirty girl. I'm gonna have to spank you for being so bad!"" I felt her shudder when I said this. I was rolling her nipples very hard at that moment.

""Let's go in the bedroom, I want to suck your cock."" Her red plump lips looked so inviting, like good cocksucker lips should.

She lay back on the bed. I offer her legs and worked off her slacks. Her panties were totally soaked. I spread her legs and started eating her pussy. My phone rang.

""Hi babe.""

""Of course I'm eating her. She is delicious! She actually tastes like you. Like mother, like daughter... OK I will."" I pulled the phone over a bit and snapped a pic.I had my tongue in her cleft. I sent the picture.

""I think she's already had two... ok, I am.""

I put the phone on speaker. ""Ok Babe, you're on speaker.""

""Hi Mom. Is Mark doing a good job? I told him to pleasure you. If he isn't, I'm gonna spank his ass. Did he make you come yet?""

""Yes Honey, you have such a wonderful boyfriend. Mark made me come just from my nipples believe it or not! This guy, oh OH, fuck. Mark, fuck me Mark. Holy SHIT I'm GONNA, Aaaaaahhhhhh!"" She shuddered and came hard.

""Did my mom just come? Hello? Mark?""

""Sorry Babe, I was tongue fucking her asshole. Now I'm gonna tease her clit till she screams. I think she likes it. She gushed all over my face. Can I call you back? I want to make her come again, and then I'll fuck her till she can't walk. That's what you want right? Mmmmmmrrrmm.""

""Yes Mark, please do her as good as you do me, ok? Later on, you can fuck us both, TOGETHER! Oh yeah!! Double blowjob, double pussy, double anal. You are gonna be so happy! Love you Mark, I love you both!""

""We love you toooooo! I'm coming again! How do you do that? Orgasm after orgasm?"" Marlene sounded breathless.

""You ready for some cock now?"" I asked.

""Please. Just take me! Fuck me hard. Suck on my tits too. Oh I need it so fuckin bad.""

I shoved my hard dick into her succulent squishy love hole. I entered her in one long hard single thrust. My girlfriends mom screamed her head off. I felt her shudder violently. That must have been a good one!

I lifted her legs up onto my shoulders, into the clamshell position, so I could pile drive her. I slammed into her cooze again and again.

Marlene's orgasm was quite spectacular. When she came, she spasmed. Her vaginal walls rippled, for lack of a better term. Then her cunt clenched my dick, and this caused my own huge climax. I felt like I pumped a gallon of jism into her hungry pussy. She was making happy sounds, not really words. At length she spoke.

""Mark, that was THE BEST fuck I ever had.""

""Marlene, that was just the appetizer. Wait 'till we get to the main course.""

""I haven't come this hard, in well... ever!""

""Are you enjoying yourself Marlene? Am I a good lover for you? I know this was supposed to be a one time thing, but I feel like I could fuck you every single day. You know what that would make me?

""A motherfucker. A truly FANTASTIC motherfucker!"" she giggled.

""It would make me so happy! You really make me feel masculine. You are grateful for whatever we do. You are built. Oh my, my, you are so fuckin built. I just want to fuck the shit out of you. I want you to be happy.""

""I have NEVER EVER been this happy before. Not in all my married years. I want to do something for you. Something I've never done with anyone."" Marlene said.

""What could that be? I think we covered all the bases fucking and sucking, that is.""

""I want..."" she took deep breaths. ""I want you to assfuck me. I want you to take my anal cherry. I did have a dildo up there once, but plastic fantastic doesn't count!""

I was dumbfounded. She wanted her future son in law to buttfuck her! And to take her anal cherry! Holy SHIT Batman!

""Well? You look, what do the Brits say? Gobsmacked! It's just my little sphincter for goodness sakes!""

""Yes""

""Yes what?""

""Yes, I'd love to buttfuck you. Yes, I would be honored to take your anal cherry off your hands! Now I'm excited.""

""My goodness. Now you're excited. What were you before? A little interested? So do you want to buttfuck me or not? I don't see you grabbing the lube. I will definitely need it with this big meat pole of yours.""

""I'm so sorry, I didn't bring any lube! We can do it next time. Maybe Donna can stop and get some on her way home from work. I'll just fuck your pussy and mouth until then.""

""But that's hours and hours from now!""

""Yeah, so? I want to fuck you all night. I want you to pass out from happiness. Wait, why are you crying?""

""You're really gonna fuck me all night? You're not just boasting?"" she was smiling.

""Well to be fair, I have to fuck Donna too. She is my fiancee. We have to stop to eat now and then. But yes, I'm gonna fuck you all night. It's gonna take a crowbar to pull me off you. You are so fine. I am the luckiest man on the planet. I have a beautiful girl, and a magnificent woman who both want me, and want to share me. It doesn't get any better that that.""

""Oh yes it does get better. Look in his old nightstand, the one on the left. I bet he left his analese. I have a secret to tell you, but you must not tell Donna. I think her dad, my ex, was either gay or bisexual. One time,I caught him sucking one of his friends. Then l caught him last year with his dick balls deep, buttfucking that eighteen year old slut Brianna. Maybe he was pretending she was a boy! Don't tell Donna please. She thinks the world of her dad.""

""Hey, I found it! I had no idea lube came in half gallon size, or cherry flavored! You want to try it?""

""Is that monster gonna fit in my ass? You're twice the size of my ex husband, and I never let the son if a bitch fuck my ass!. I don't want you to split me in half! You're fuckin huge!""

""Donna never complains. And we don't even have cherry flavor lube! Brianna used to like it too. Until she met your ex husband. I suppose I should be grateful he showed me her true colors. And he introduced me to you and your wonderful daughter. His stealing her from me paved the way for me to fall in love with your daughter, and you for that matter. I love you Marlene.""

""Brianna must be an idiot to have left you for my ex. I know for a fact he spent a fortune of OUR MONEY on her. Fat fuck. By the way, I love you too Mark. But I don't ever want to interfere with your relationship with Donna.""

""Too late. We both want you in our bed permanently! Or at least as long as you want to be there.""

""But...it's so wrong! It's so dirty and bad! I want to be there, but I feel so confused and conflicted. But you know what...I'm gonna let you buttfuck me. Just please go slow! Donna says she has giant orgasms when you assfuck her. I want this for me as much as you!""

""I want you to fuck my ass. Come on, shove that log up my tushy. I'll even spread my cheeks for you. Ohhhhmygod you're so big! Slow! Uhh, uhh, uhh, yeah now do it. Take me! Make me yours. Oh I'm gonna... cooommmee! Yes!"" Marlene shuddered very violently, and climaxed for me. She was on all fours in front of me, with her head on the pillow and her ass in the air. She had just had a pretty big climax with my big dick almost halfway in her rectum.

I was going in and out moderately slowly. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt her. It was a spectacular fuck for me. Marlene was clenching rhythmically, she was building to a big crescendo, I could feel it. I never felt more masculine than I did at that moment. She reached behind her and felt that I was only giving her a portion of my cock.

""Holy shit Mark! You're holding out on me! I WANT ALL OF THIS MONSTER! PLEASE! TREAT ME LIKE THE DIRTY LITTLE SLUT I AM. I'M YOUR PERSONAL CUM BUCKET. NOW FUCK ME DEEEEEPER!"" I obliged her, and I started going deeper and harder. She was just about to come, and I wanted to make it the best come she had ever had, with me balls deep in her rectum! Then quite suddenly, she was coming, a giant shuddering, shivering climax, with her eyes rolled back in her head and her mouth wide open, but no words came out as she came and squirted all over me and finally screamed her head off:

""Maaaaaark! Iiiiiiiii looooove yoooouuuu!""

""I love you too Marlene. Let's stop all this foreplay and get down to some real fucking!"" I had ejaculated sometime during her orgasm, and it was sublime! A cum that a man never forgets, that would put a smile on my face to my dying day, yeah it was that good. But truthfully, it was Marlene's climax that stood out in my mind. She made me feel like a king, her orgasm that could have been measured on the Richter scale.

Marlene was crying, I pulled my still hard, now dripping cock out of her anus and went to her. I held her like she was injured. My face close to hers, like I could kiss away the pain. Oh shit what had I done to her! ""Oh my God Marlene, did I hurt you? I am so sorry! I-"" she interrupted me.

""-NO, NO, NO! Mark my love, these are not tears of pain. These are tears of joy. I have never, ever come so hard and so long! I have never had such rapture, such pleasure, such a big fucking, dirty, damn fine ORGASM! A CUM FOR THE RECORD BOOKS. Holy shit did I ever cum! I pissed the bed, I came so hard!""

""No Marlene, you squirted! About one out of five women squirt if they cum hard enough. At least that's what I read in Cosmo.""

""Mark, that was the single best fuck I have ever had. I am so fucked.""

""Oh no, no, no! That was just the appetizer Marlene. Round two will be in a bit when my dick recovers from your very tight little asshole! You know I came too? I shot a huge load where the sun don't shine!""

Her eyes went wide. ""You can fuck like that twice a night?! My husband would have been asleep right now. Wait a second, you came in my cunt earlier! That last orgasm pushed everything else out of my mind! You came hard both times and HOLY SHIT. Your cock... is hard again!""

I was underneath the beautiful woman, sucking on a huge hard nipple, as I tortured the other one with my left hand. I twisted and turned and pulled on her nipple as I sucked for dear life on the other one. Then I switched and sucked the opposite tit, and tortured it's mate. Marlene's moans became louder and more staccato, she came again, that dirty girl! She was trying to get my dick in her pussy or her butt again, but we were out of position.

""Wait a second Marlene. Pussy or ass?

""Put your cock in my cunt. Oh I feel so dirty! I'm in bed, fuckin' my lucky daughter's boyfriend. And I just used the word 'CUNT' and 'COCK'. I am yours now Mark. You own me now. Take me. Mark me Mark. I'm gonna get a tattoo on my forehead that says 'Property of Mark'. Oh yes, Yes, YES! Uuugh AAAIIIEEEE!! I JUST CAME AGAIN. OH YOUR BIG...

AAAAAIIEEEEAAAHHH!""

She was on top of me her hips going a-mile-a-minute, she was gasping and grunting and shuddering as she blasted off. Then she stopped. Her cunt however was still wildly pulsing, grabbing and SQUEEZING my distended member. What a woman! She climaxed so hard. Her head was back, her mouth open, but again no words came out... and then she screamed my name:

""M A R K! MARK. UUGHH.YES MARK! OH FUCK UUGHH. YOU FUCKIN BASTARD! I'VE NEVER HAD IT SO...

UUUGHHH! GOOD BEFORRRRE!"" She screamed loud enough to wake the dead, ""Eeeeeeeyyyyaaahhhhh!!"" That was it. She fell forward on me, her cunt still on my dick, seemingly on autopilot, grasping and spasming like a seizure. I had come so very hard during her orgasm, so hard I was going to make sure I had not spurted out one of my testicles. But my orgasms were nothing compared to her climaxes. She could start to give them categories, like hurricanes! They were just like her daughter's cums. I just thought, wow, I'm gonna fuck these two every night I can. I probably won't live longer than a month, but what a way to go. FUCKED TO DEATH BY TWO GORGEOUS WOMEN. I will have that on my tombstone!

My wonderful future-mother-in-law was out like a light. She was drooling on my face, but I did not give a damn! She was so, so terrific.

""Honey I'm home!"" I wanted to move, to get out from under my new lover, feeling that I had cheated on her terribly, but I just couldn't move. My dick was still hard, and I was balls deep in my girlfriend's mom. Her giant melons still in my hands, her drool on my face, and I could feel our combined juices leaking out around my pulsing shaft. Her cunt was still spasming on auto-cum!

""WOW you really did it! My mom is passed out.""

""Thank goodness! I thought I'd killed her. She came just like you, like dynamite.""

""How many times?""she asked.

""Times what? Sex? We fucked three or four times. Cums? Me three times, your mom, I'm not sure. Maybe eight or ten. She squirted at least three times."" My girlfriend was taking pictures with her phone, She scooped up some of the big pool of juices on my groin and delicately put them in her mouth.

""Mmmm good! You are still hard? I want your dick in me RIGHT NOW YOU FUCKIN BASTARD. GIMME YOUR DICK! I WANT YOU NOW!"" I guess my new name was Fuckin Bastard! I didn't mind. Donna had moved her mom gently, but firmly over to the side, and she promptly sucked my dick almost all the way down. She never got the last three inches in her mouth, but I was ok with her choking herself, she really wanted to take it all! Then when she was sure of my hardness, she jumped on top of me, still removing clothes as she fucked me. Her very beautiful tits were very big, but no match for her mom's gigantic bosoms. Still they were very firm and high. I grabbed those luscious orbs and started lickin and nipple twisting. Meanwhile, Donna was driving her juicy snatch down onto my meat pole! Again and again I felt her shudder.

""You little bitch! Are you coming ALREADY?! We just started fucking. Now I'll never last!"" I could feel my come generating. It wouldn't be long.

""Shut up you fuckin bastard! You love it. I love you. Oh shit, fuck, Fuck, FUUUCK ME MARK. OH HOW I LOVE YOU, YOU FUCKIN BASTARD. Uuuugh. Ughhhh. Uhhgh. Yes I'm coming again! Oh oh yeah. Mark! MARK I LOVE YOU"" I came too, with her cunt spasming just like her mom's. Oh what a lucky man I was.

""Mark I have to tell you something.""

""You want to talk NOW while I'm balls deep in your cooter? It must be important.""",,2025-08-15T19:11:27.548026,3790,

Chapter 8

""So. I didn't expect to see you getting to work already, Victoria,"" Iga asks, stepping up from behind me in the lab. She does not draw attention to how she has not been present thus far.

""It's better to get to this sooner than later. Even with the process working as it does, fresh tissue is best,"" I say, continuing to cut into the cadaver. Removing a vagina is actually a new one for me, if you can believe that.

""I guess nothing can take the scientist out of-"" Iga begins, but is immediately interrupted by a series of labored grunts echoing through the lab.

""Iga, do we still have any replacement parts for the voice tubes?"" I ask, looking up and staring straight forward, ""This one appears to be broken, and I can't shut it off. It, um, coincidentally leads directly to my bedroom. Which is where Eve is right now. And Eli. I have suspicions about the tube breaking in such a specific way, at such a specific time, but no evidence.""

""Um, I'm not sure. I'll have to check. I was just down in the basement, and I didn't see anything, but I wasn't really looking. Just checking on our... guest. She's down there. Eve put her in the cell down there. Also, we have a cell in the basement. Which I didn't know. So there's that,"" Iga informs me.

""Yeah... I think we put that in before you got here. It was related to the thing with the fire weasels. It's complicated,"" I explain.

Iga pauses in thought, and in the silence, we can both hear a series of loud moans echoing through the voice tube.

""That cell doesn't seem like it would really hold something like a-"" she begins.

""Hindsight is 20/20, Iga,"" I quickly interrupt her. No need to relive old failures.

""Right,"" Iga says, after a long moment in which we get to hear some moans that are clearly masculine, this time, ""So Eve locked her down there. She's taking it well, all things considered. That may involve certain promises. But that's probably nothing to worry about.""

""Promises?"" I quirk an eyebrow.

""Eve said something to the effect of letting the coroner have turns with Eli if she behaved herself and didn't cause trouble,"" Iga unsuccessfully tries to downplay it by saying it so casually, ""But probably an empty promise. I mean, Eve seems pretty busy riding his cock as it is, I can't image her stopping to give someone else a turn.""

I could point out that she isn't helping, but that seems like an obvious conclusion. Unfortunately, our awkward silence is met by a similar silence from the voice tube, which was so noticeably loud just a moment ago.

Eve graces us with her presence a lot earlier than I might have expected. She appears in the lab, thoroughly naked, with a sheen of sweat across her skin, and an expectant look. And it's a weird time to be self-satisfied with my work, but she really is quite the specimen.

""Are you prepared to perform the operation?"" she demands to know, in a rather stoic tone.

""It's, um..."" I can't help but notice a thick stream of semen dripping down her thigh as she approaches.

""Eve, I think you've got a little-"" Iga feels the need to draw attention to it, for some reason, but is met with a decidedly harsh stare from Eve, to which she backs off, ""You know what? Nevermind.""

""I'm... almost done removing the, um, parts,"" I tell her, ""Did you mean for us to do this now?""

""Yes. The operation will be the most successful if the tissue is fresh, correct?"" she astutely observes.

""Eve! I think they need time to finish with-"" Eli calls out to her, coming down the stairs.

""No, Victoria says she is ready,"" Eve says, without turning to him.

He's also naked, but actually observes some level of modesty, half heartedly covering his penis with one hand. Which is a little silly, since everyone in this room has had it inside of them. And one of them still has her fluids all over him. Making him look very shiny. And smell incredibly lewd.

""Oh,"" he says, a little surprised. It's nice that he was coming down to protect me from being interrupted. He's a sweetie like that.

""We are just about prepared,"" I nod.

""Well we're not doing this already, it seems a little earl-"" he yelps out loud, though in surprise, not pain, as Eve reaches back and firmly grabs his penis.

Iga's and my eyes shoot open in surprise, as well as she pulls at him, and he's given no choice but to follow.

""Hey! Be careful with him!"" I demand of her, a little unwisely, now that I think of it.

""He belongs to me,"" she declares, with a slight scowl in my direction, ""I will do with his body as I please.""

I glare back, angered at this behavior, but knowing full well that there's not really anything I can do, right now. Iga does not look as outraged as she should be. She's mostly just staring at the way that Eve drags him along.

Eve pauses and looks back at me, almost with sympathy, ""Don't worry. I'm not going to harm him. That would interfere with my ability to use him, sexually.""

""What... Where are you taking him?!"" I again demand, as she pulls him along towards the door.

""To the basement. I will lock him up with the hospital woman,"" she informs us. Not a fan of that.

""What for?"" Iga asks.

""So that you cannot kill me while I am unconscious,"" Eve says, flatly, ""I have changed the combination on the cell door, and only I know it. You will have to complete the operation to get him released.""

""What!"" I throw up my hands, ""Eve, I would...""

Iga and I exchange a nervous, knowing glance, ""Eve, I would probably never do something like that! That's absurd!"" I declare, a little unconvincingly.

""The hospital woman will also have my permission to use him for sex while they're locked up together,"" Eve adds, ""It should keep her docile and cooperative.""

My jaw sets in, but she's already led my poor baby out of the room by his penis, by the time I muster up the courage to protest.

The operation actually goes a lot smoother than I would have expected. I've never replaced an entire female reproductive system before, and the new one is noticeably smaller than Eve's more robust frame. She's much taller than the petite asian woman we removed the vagina from, though still a little shorter than Eli - Iga, at one point, accused me of specifically making her a good height for pairing well with him, whether consciously or not. Which is madness, because that implies that I somehow wanted her to take advantage of my poor baby. How insulting! As if I'd get off on the idea of my Eli being with some other woman. Granted, Iga didn't say that was specifically why, but I could tell she was thinking it. I took the opportunity to remind her that these accusations that I would subconsciously sabotage myself are likely, in fact, her own insecurities about being so short and not being able to compete with my genius. She laughed at that, which is, I guess, some sort of defense mechanism to avoid dealing with the truth.

Speaking of genius, I do manage to 'install' her new vagina in record time. Like I said, I've not done this specifically before, but between how much stitching parts together I did when assembling Eve, and my overall impressive intellect, figuring out this sort of thing was fairly trivial.

""So..."" Iga pipes up as we finish, ""Do we really want to wake her back up?""

""Of course, how else will we know if everything went right?"" I lift up my hands, but not my eyes, at Iga's silly question.

""I mean because of the whole 'constantly making our boyfriend her personal semen supply' problem,"" Iga crosses her arms.

Oh, that. For a moment, I'd gotten so invested in my work that I forgot the exact particulars of our living situation with the monster on the slab. It does feel good to be really working, creating, again.

""Well, Eli is still locked up with that corpse-counting harlot down there, what am I supposed to..."" I realize what she just said, ""What do you mean 'our' boyfriend?""

She laughs, uncomfortably, ""I mean, technically speaking, I've been intimate with him more than you have in the past six months, give or take, so he's really as much mine as yours. I didn't mean to imply that he was also the boyfriend of Eve and the coroner downstairs. We should really ask her what her name is, by the way.""

I narrow my eyes at her, ""Eli is mine, Iga.""

""That's not what his cock says, so..."" she abruptly stops, clearing her throat and averting her eyes when I continue to glare at her.

""We have to get him out of the cell, and Eve is the only one who knows the combination. I'm kind of in a corner here, Iga,"" I say, flatly.

""Okay, yes. He's locked in the cell downstairs. And yes, that coroner woman has probably got the head of his cock on her tonsils as we speak,"" Iga says, unhelpfully, ""But that doesn't mean that he's stuck in there without the combination. We can find another way to break him out, can't we?""

My eye twitches a little, ""He's not doing anything. And those bars are a special carbon-tungsten fiber I put together, they aren't going to break so easily. We need to get my baby out of there, and so far, Eve has kept her word.""

Iga puts up her hands in surrender, ""I can go either way. He either fucks the coroner for awhile, or he fucks Eve for awhile. I'm willing to share him, either way, you're the one that wants to get all greedy with Eli.""

""It's not greed, he's -my- boyfriend, Iga,"" I scowl in her direction.

""Yes, yes. Fine. He calls your name in bed, after all. Fair enough,"" she continues to be kind of a bitch.

""Are you trying to provoke me?"" I ask her, my voice dropping deeper.

""Sorry, Victoria,"" she sighs, ""Just tense from all the undead monsters and corpse thievery and not getting to have sex with our boyfriend.""

I guess that's as close to an apology as I'm going to get, ""Let's just wake her up. We can figure out our next step after Eli is free.""

""I can't help but notice that the words 'let's wake her up' have been followed, not by waking her up, but by doing the exact thing that I suggested,"" Iga complains, unhelpfully.

""As a woman of science, I reserve the right to change my mind, should new information become available, or should closer inspection of the details require a re-evaluation of the details,"" I carefully explain, and honestly, Iga sometimes just doesn't think like a scientist, ""Now hand me to blowtorch, already.""

Iga sighs and surrenders it, ""Is this really a good idea, with them so... naked, in there?""

""That's a good point. Sweetie, you probably want to stand near the back of the cell. Avert your eyes and turn around. You can hide behind the corpse counter to avoid any stray sparks, too,"" I tell Eli.

""First off, my name is Felicia, not corpse counter,"" she begins with some crap no one cares about, ""And I take exception to be used as-""

""Why are you even naked, too, you degenerate harlot?!"" I shut my eyes tight, as if it will drown out her whiny voice.

""Degenerate? You're the one that offered me your boyfriend so you could steal bodies out of the morgue!"" she exclaims.

""Offered! You used extortion to force yourself on him!"" I am unfortunately unable to strangle her from the other side of the bars, ""Besides, what I did was for science, what you did was just for your own debased urges, you whore! And you still haven't answered why you're naked in there, when you were fully clothed when you arrived!""

""I didn't want to make Eli feel uncomfortable by being the only one naked in here, so I got naked too. Obviously,"" she throws up her hands like that's some sensible conclusion.

""Don't pretend you care about his feelings, you horrid bitch!"" I yell, ""He's just a piece of meat to you!""

""That's not true... but, there are parts which are certainly nice cuts,"" she leans back to give Eli posterior an extended gaze, before firmly slapping him on the ass.

He jumps as that skank sexually harasses him, ""Ow! Hey now! Look, ladies, we're all in this together. Can we not be so antagon-""

My eye twitches, ""Do you ever want to get out of this cage?"" I ask her, my voice dropping.

""As long as I have Eli in here, why would I need to?"" corpse-slut looks me straight in the eye and smiles while she reaches out to firmly grab ahold of Eli's cock.

Iga doesn't quite manage to stop me before the blowtorch goes soaring through the air, between the bars, and just narrowly misses connecting with that whore's head. I stumble to the side a little, but don't fall as Iga tries to tackle me, but her short stature and low mass means that it doesn't amount to much.

""Victoria, that's not helping!"" she shouts at me.

""Yeah, cause I missed, goddammit!"" I shout back.

""Eli's right. We need to just take a deep and remember that us fighting amongst ourselves is not going to help our situation with the aggressive sex-zombie upstairs. Who I might add has not been under anasthesia for awhile, and could wake up at any time and is this really how you want her to catch us?!"" Iga pleads with us, totally ignoring that that whore is still groping my baby just feet away from me.

Eli, being the sweetheart that he is, returns my blowtorch, and then does a second time, when it's thrown again. But unfortunately, it's actual function proves to be for naught. I was right, this thing is simply not going to cut through those bars. Shit.

I am, eventually, forced to give up and concede to my earlier decision that this would be a fruitless endeavor. Which technically means I'm still right, despite Iga's insistence that taking both positions on a topic doesn't mean that I'm right either way. This is why she's just a lab assistant.

But onto more important things - we are greeted with an empty table when we return to the lab. She's gone. Apparently got up, removed her IVs, and walked off. Didn't put her clothes on, but that's pretty standard for Eve.

""Not an encouraging development,"" Iga understates the obvious.

I nearly pull my hair out, ""Where'd she go now?!""

""I've... got a pretty good idea. She doesn't exactly have a complicated modus operandi, Victoria,"" Iga points out.

""Well we have to stop her!"" I turn and storm out, back to the basement, with Iga in tow.

""That's never exactly worked before, you know?""

""Yes, but if she starts going at him now, she's going to tear some of those seams and destroy all my work,"" I explain, jogging down the stairs.

""Um. She fucked him like his cock had an antidote, pretty much the moment she came to life, I fail to see how it's going to damage her this time,"" Iga says, ""I think you're just being jealous. As usual.""

""I am doing nothing of the sort. It's different this time. It's a fresh operation that didn't involve reanimation, and the seams and stitches have to... um..."" I groan, ""Shut up! We just have to stop it, that's a fact!""

""It just doesn't seem like a very scientif-""

""Oh, danger,"" I turn back and say to her my voice dropping, ""You wouldn't be lecturing me about science, would you?""

She puts up her hands in surrender, ""No. No we're good. Stop her from using the pussy you gave her to use. Got it.""

Eve isn't at the cell. Unfortunately, neither is Eli.

""Where did they go?!"" I demand of the only remaining occupant.

""Hm? Who are you talking abou-"" she narrowly dodges a thrown blowtorch for the third time.

""Answer. The Question.""

""Yeesh, why are you so uptight? I'm the one being held against my will,"" she tries in vain to compare her plight to my own.

""Where-"" my eye twitches.

""I don't know! She didn't tell me. Just dragged him off by the cock like a leash. She did say I could get next, since he didn't fuck me proper while we were together in here,"" she examines her nails in the bitchest way possible, ""I mean, I'd like to get out of here, but if I can get some of the D, that works too. And not just cause it pisses you off, but, I mean, considering how good he was with his tongue...""

""I'm going to turn you into a limbless cyborg toaster, but that will have to wait,"" I turn and rush back out.

""She's probably joking about that. She's just a little tense right now,"" Iga says to her as we leave. Good thinking, make her believe it's all hyperbole, so she doesn't panic.

You know when you lose something, but then find it as soon as you stop looking? Well that's what happens. In my bedroom. After I had searched it three times. Only that is usually a feeling of relief not a... Not sure what you'd call the feeling of finding a patchwork superwoman riding your boyfriend's face in your own bed.

""Um... hi Eve... could you..."" I begin, feeling like I need to slowly back out of the room.

""I'm busy,"" she states quite flatly, as she continues to groan while she treats my baby's face like a saddle.

""Right. About that. I'm not sure you and Eli should-""

""Eli is also busy,"" she reminds me, still without even looking back.

""I see that,"" I avert my eyes a bit.

I want to yell at her. I want to tell her to get off my man and stop all this presumption that she can just take him whenever she wants. I want to tell her what an awful, evil bitch she's being, and that I didn't create her for this. I want to furiously masturbate.

Wait that last one... nevermind, my mind's all over the place.

Regardless, I don't do any of those things. Instead, I just stand there. I stand there and watch, and feel helpless while I watch her arch her back and moan, bucking her hips on poor Eli's tongue as she loudly and aggressively cums all over his lips. I swallow hard, and I continue to tell myself that my arousal is just a normal autonomic response. But what I don't do, is anything to stop her, or even slow her down.

She lets out a sigh of relief when she is, apparently, done for the moment, and steps off of him. Eli gasps as he is freed from between her quite powerful thighs.

""So, Eve,"" I clear my throat as I begin yet another attempt to reason with her.

""I'm going to test penetration of the new vagina,"" she informs me, going into the bathroom to fill a glass of water, ""Prepare Eli's penis for me. He needs to be as erect as possible.""

""Right, about that. I think you need to wait on, um, testing that,"" that's probably not going to convince her.

""Why? It feels fine. And my responses worked fine when he was licking me,"" she takes a large gulp of water, before walking back over, ""Are you saying this because you are jealous, and this is an attempt to take my male for your own use? Like the other woman did?""

-I'm- taking him! -Her- male! The nerve of this... wait, what was that last part?

""The other woman?""

""Yes, the short one with the tighter vagina, who is always with you. Iga,"" she makes some unfounded claims, ""She was here earlier, telling me that I should let her use him instead, because of the transplant, and that I should not mention it to you.""

Excuse me, Iga, I believe this knife in my back belongs to you.

""Look, I'm not trying to,"" I take a deep breath so I don't fly into a rage, ""...get between you. It's just so soon after the operation. The body needs to heal, and I don't think it's ready to use. Eli's cock might, um, tear some seams.""

""He does buck very hard. Perhaps you are right,"" Eve nods. Did that just fucking work?

""I still desire to be intimate with him. I will use you as a proxy,"" she tells me, and immediately grabs my hand, pulling me towards the bed.

""Eve, what are doing with her, exactly?"" Eli sits up, taking notice of what's going on around him, presumably after catching his breath from the mouth-rape.

""Victoria will help us with her mouth. You may lie back for me,"" she doesn't wait for a response, just pressing a hand to his chest and tossing him back towards the bed.

She practically tears his pants open with one hand, the other still attached to my wrist. She pulls me close, releasing my hand and opting instead to grab me by the hair.

""I don't recall agreeing to- mffy uh iff,"" I try to protest before she forces my mouth onto Eli's not-quite-hard but certainly not flaccid penis. That status quickly changes.",,2025-08-15T19:11:33.140371,3653,

Chapter 12

***

When I got master to agree to let Lucy out of the house with me, for 'errands', I was hoping, maybe, that I could get her to sometimes also assist me on actual errands. But I suppose that was a lot to expect. It would be nice, if she actually came up with a legitimate reason why she couldn't help, instead of just being kind of a bitch about it. But again, a lot to expect.

Not that I really trust her with anything complicated, but helping me carry these groceries would have been nice. As it is, it' almost dark when I get home.

It's not that elves aren't allowed to drive or anything, and I do have a license, so it's not that I have to walk, per se. But, well... my feet don't quite reach the pedals on master's car. A little embarrassing, I know. They don't make them for elves. But as it is, the market is close, so it's no real trouble.

The house is quiet when I come in. There's nothing unusual about that. Well, there would be nothing unusual before Lucy joined us. It's common for master to be up in his study around this time, but the demon being a pain is also normal around this time.

Unless he made an exception, and she's up there with him. Doing who know's what.

No, no, I know what. It's fine. She needs to be fed, I get that. It's nothing new. I don't think he'd go farther, just out of the blue. He has excellent self control, and he enjoys denying her. He'd make a bigger deal of it, if he did. I'd know.

I think.

I push the idea out of my head and go to the kitchen. I unpack my ingredients and start working at preparing dinner. All fresh, I always make sure of that. I'm not sure if master can really tell the difference in the quality that I make sure goes into his food, but I'm sure his body can, and that's what matters.

I'm washing a potato when the feel of a pair of strong hands cup my breasts from behind. I jump almost a foot into the air. The sound of the running water must have muffled the approach. One does not normally sneak up on an elf so easily.

""Master, you scared me half to death!"" I exclaim, looking back at him.

He doesn't say anything. Which seems a little odd at first, but master isn't always all that chatty. Or this grabby. But if master wants to have a little grope on his elf, who am I to object to it?

His hands gently toy with my chest, and I bite my lip a little, enjoying the touch. No bra today, and he takes advantage of that. I can get away with it sometimes - I'm far from buxom, but not exactly flat chested either. Elves don't worry about it so much, we tend to stay, erm, perky, so support isn't a big issue. Regardless of what my chest has to offer him, I'm glad he enjoys them.

He lightly pinches my nipples, and my toes curl a little. I'm wet already. Well, I'm always a little wet, thank you, chastity belt, but you know what I mean. He leans down and nibbles at the tip of my ear. Now I'm drenched. I'm not sure if he's aware that that's my weak spot, but I suppose it's pretty common for elves.

I push back against him, and can feel his erection through his pants. He pushes back, making my heart pound a little. I know better than to get my hopes up, master can be something of a tease, if you weren't aware. Still, it's hard not to get excited.

Then he pulls back. Because, of course.

""Lorelei, take of your clothes,"" he commands, and my fingers are on the buttons of my blouse before he even finishes speaking.

I turn to face him and drop off one garment after another, until it's just me and my chastity belt, looking at him, ready for his next command.

He steps forward and kisses me hard, and I can feel his fingers slide down to my belt. Over the buttons. I hear a series of clicks, and then... nothing. Another series of clicks. Nothing. His lips part in an irritated groan. A few more clicks, with no result. I've never known him to forget something like this.

And something about his expression seems... off.

""Master? Are you alright?"" I ask, with genuine concern.

He doesn't respond, just keeps fiddling with the combination. And there's beads of sweat on his head. Something isn't right.

I stand on my toes and reach up, putting the back of my hand against his forehead.

""Master... you are a little warm, maybe you should lie down,"" I tell him.

He grabs my wrist and pulls it down, ""I'm fine. I just need the key. Where do I keep it?""

""You're asking me?"" I can't help but be perplexed. I have an idea of where it is, but I don't investigate on purpose. I don't need that sort of temptation.

""Lorelei, I'm your master, and I'm ordering you to tell me where the key is,"" he says, not seeming as confident as I've come to expect from him lately.

""Master, I don't know. And I really don't think you're well. You should sit down and let me bring you some water,"" I say, reaching up again to dab his forehead with a towel.

""I don't need water, I need pussy,"" he tries another combination, with no luck.

""Master, where is Lucy?"" I ask, piecing it together.

He gives an annoyed groan and grabs me by the wrist, aggressively pulling me out into the living room and pushing me over the side of a chair, ""Fine, backdoor it is.""

He licks his fingers and I feel him press them against my exposed little ass, which reflexively squeezes tight. I've never been afraid of master, but this feels wrong.

You know when you ask a dog what they've got in their mouth, and they start chewing faster? That's what this sudden aggression feels like.

Before he penetrate me, I quickly get up and turn, putting my fingers to his cheeks, casting a simple exorcism spell. A cloud of sulfur smelling ash seems to erupt from everywhere around him, and he tumbles forward to his knees. I struggle to catch his weight before he can fall further. And as the smoke clears, there's Lucy, laying on the floor behind him, stark naked and dazed.

""Master! Master are you alright!?"" I shout as I try to lift him.

Before he says anything, he reaches out a hand at the succubus. She tries to get up and escape, but in an instant, her hands and knees fall to the floor, and she seems to be anchored in place.

He slowly gets to his feet with my help, rubbing his head. A hand tilts my chin up and gives me a soft, slow kiss.

""Thank you, Lorelei. Have I mentioned how much I appreciate you, lately?"" he says with a tired smile.

I try to guide him to a chair, but he doesn't follow, ""I'll be alright, don't worry.""

""How did this happen?"" I ask, trying my best to fuss over him to the extent that he'll let me.

""A fair question,"" he says, but doesn't elaborate, walking over to the demon.

""I really think you should rest, master.""

""And I will. But there's something to attend to first,"" he grabs Lucy firmly by one of her horns, and starts dragging her along.

""What... what will you do with her?"" I ask, nervously.

""She's not going anywhere, if that's what you're asking,"" he tells me, which somehow makes me both relieved and anxious at once.

""We'll be in the basement,"" he says, unlocking the door to it, ""Let me know when dinner is ready, will you?""

""Um, of course, master.""",,2025-08-15T19:11:39.863046,1357,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-taking-of-taylor-s,The Taking of Taylor S,Unknown Author,,,,,"Cold air bristled over Taylor Smith's midriff as she, her mother Carrie, and her younger sister Anne stepped out into the cold mid-October night. Taylor was a competitive college dancer, who had just finished up a major competition and was glad to be heading home for a week of relaxation. Taylor went to school two hours outside of her hometown, but because the dance competition was the same day as her fall break began, and because the competition was in her hometown she had opted to not travel back to the school with her team, and instead headed straight home. Fortunately, her mother and sister had decided to come watch the competition and so she had an easy ride home. Taylor was excited to be home, her father had died at the end of the prior school year, and Taylor hadn't been able to come home since, but she was looking forward to being with her mom and sister, and feeling the warmth that only existed at home.

After dancing Taylor had been too hot to change into other clothing and just wanted to go outside. Now, Taylor stood on a street corner in a blue and white one piece dance suit with one full arm, and one arm missing, and the middle of her petite stomach showing. Carrie Smith raised an arm and hailed a cab. The thirty-nine year old mother had no trouble getting one to stop quickly, at 5'6"" and 150 pounds Carrie was a gorgeous woman, and tonight she had on a short skirt that showed off her long pale legs, and a tight top making her B cup breasts look even bigger.

The cab driver stopped, parked his car, and noticing Taylor's bags immediately jumped out to help them. Taylor was immediately taken aback by the size of the man, the cab driver, who's name badge said ""Jake"" was easily six foot four, and built like a heavyweight boxer, all muscle, and in a tight black shirt that showed his abs off. Jake grabbed the bags quickly and effortlessly tossed them into the trunk of the cab before opening the doors for the women.

Carrie gave instructions on how to get to the house, and the cab driver quickly took them there. The foursome made small talk all the way to the house, and when the cabbie pulled into their driveway he quickly leapt out, opened the girl's doors, and grabbed the bags to take them to the door for Taylor.

""No she can get them, it's her fault for bringing so much shit home for one week."" Carrie said to Jake.

""No miss, I insist I wouldn't feel right making a young woman carry her things to the house when I am capable of doing it myself, besides it's no extra charge."" Jake replied.

Carrie nodded, noticing how forceful, and yet charming the man had been in his reply, it left Carrie feeling like she had no other choice but to say yes. Jake let the three women lead him to the front door, and after Carrie unlocked the door set the bags just inside the entry way.

Jake turned to leave when Carrie said ""oh wait, I haven't paid you yet.""

Jake turned around, and then stepped back inside the entryway, as he did so he pulled from his waist band a revolver and held it next to Taylor's throat. ""Oh, I knew you hadn't paid me yet, I was just going to wait a bit and take my payment a different way. But since you mention it, why don't I just accelerate my time table.""

Jake closed the front door behind him and roughly shoved Taylor through the entry way and into the living room. Then, using his massive hand he grabbed both Carrie, and Anne both by the hair in one movement and pulled them into the living room behind him.

""I want all of you to line up in one line right now."" Jake said.

Anne and Carrie did as they were told but Taylor, who was sprawled on the ground from the shove struggled to get up at first. ""Move bitch."" Jake said ""don't make anymore dumb decisions like bringing home three bags for one week.""

Taylor scrambled into line with her mother, and almost fell again as the slick material of her dance leggings slipped on the floor.

Jake produced three pairs of handcuffs and ordered Taylor to put the cuffs on her mom and sister. As Taylor did so Jake yelled ""tighter, I don't want any of you trying anything stupid.""

Taylor tightened the cuffs in spite of her mother's cry of pain as the cold metal cut into her wrists. When Taylor was done Jake put a pair of cuffs on Taylor as well.

""Now, Taylor, I don't want you looking like a dolled up whore anymore, so you're going to get a bath. But because I can't leave these two alone you'll have to bathe right here in the living room."" Jake said grinning.

Jake left the room and went into the kitchen, as he left he said ""nobody moves, I'll hear it if you do, and then you'll all die.""

Jake came back a few minutes later with a two gallon stock pot full of water, soap, and a washrag.

""Now, I bet that school makes you pay for that fancy uniform of yours, so I'm not going to cut it off of you"" Jake said brandishing scissors ""unless you can't get out of it in the next minute or two. Once you're out of it your mommy is going to wash you up just like a little girl.""

As Taylor struggled out of the uniform Jake proceeded to walk over to Carrie and start cutting the clothes of the older woman. In less than a minute Carrie was naked in front of Jake, her clothing cut to pieces on the floor around her. Jake then advanced on Taylor's sister Anne. Anne was the shortest of the three, standing only 5'3""compared to Taylor's 5'5"", she also weighed a bit more than Taylor at 135 as opposed to 130, but her weight was distributed better, leaving her with large C cup breasts and a thick ass.

As the scissors started to cut Anne's jeans, Carrie lunged at Jake trying to disarm him but Jake side stepped and let Carrie fall across the floor. Jake then pointed the gun at Taylor and said ""hurry the fuck up, your momma is getting restless apparently.""

Jake finished cutting all of the clothing off of Anne, and held one of the eighteen year old's breasts in his hand before pinching her nipples eliciting a moan. He then looked at Taylor, who was all jumbled up in her outfit, but mostly nude, it was impossible for her to get the last part of the top off of herself with the handcuff on. Jake undid it for a moment, took the clothing off of Taylor, and then refastened the cuff tighter than before.

Jake turned to look at Carrie who was on the floor sobbing and terrified. ""Stop sniffling and come bathe your daughter, wipe the whore make up off of her, and make sure she doesn't smell as badly of sweat as she does now.""

Carrie began to dip her hands into the stock pot and pour water all over Taylor. Once Taylor's body was soaked Carrie lathered her daughter's entire body, while both women wept openly.

""I'm so sorry sweetheart."" Carrie said to Taylor as her hands crossed her daughter's pubic bone.

""It's okay mom, it's okay, it'll be fine."" Taylor said as tears rolled down her face.

While Carrie bathed Taylor, Jake stood behind Anne and used one hand to grope at the girl's heaving breasts.

""It's fun to watch this isn't it.?"" Jack whispered to Anne as he kissed her ear.

Anne stood stoic, not responding, and fighting back tears.

""You don't have to answer, I can tell you like it."" Jake said as he slipped his hand onto Anne's clit, and slowly rubbed his finger up and down.

For five more minutes Jake touched Anne, while watching Carrie bathe Taylor. Then he stopped the bathing, and found a small towel for Taylor to dry herself with. Once Taylor was mostly dry he told all three of them to line up again.

""I'm going to fuck one of you, and because I know how hard this is I won't make anyone decide for anyone else, I'll just fuck the one of you who is ugliest, and likely gets the least attention from boys."" Jake said.

He walked to Taylor who's eyes continued to gush water and said ""is it you? Or is it your mommy or your sissy?""

Taylor shook her head violently signally that she wasn't going to answer.

Jack grabbed Taylor's throat and began crushing her wind pipe as he growled ""you really should answer, it's all your fault this is happening little slut, if I didn't have to carry bags your mommy could've tried to pay in the car. If you weren't home they wouldn't have watched you dance, it's all your fault. If your sister gets raped it'll be your fault. If your mom gets raped it'll be your fault, and if I force my cock into your tight little asshole it'll be all your fault.""

""Please stop"" Carrie cried out trying to protect her daughter.

Jack let go as Carrie cried and reached into his pocket and pulled out a black magic marker.

""Fine, I'll do it this way, I'm going to rank each of your bodies: I'll rank 1-3 for your legs, your ass, your cunt, your stomach, your face, and your tits, then I'm going to add that up, and whoever has the highest number loses and I'm going to destroy.""

Anne spoke up for the first time ""stop, just stop, you can take me but stop.""

""Nope"" Jack replied, ""too late for that, I want to play my little game now.""

""Let's start with your legs."" Jack said.

He walked to Taylor first, and ran his hands up and down her legs, massaging in between her thighs, and right at the base of her ass. When he was done touching her left leg he slapped her thigh hard, and Taylor again began to bawl.

Jack then did the same thing to both Carrie and Anne before saying ""Anne's legs are the best"" he drew a number 1 on the front and back of both of her legs as he said it. ""They're the most toned, and even though she's the shortest they're still the best.""

Anne let out an audible sigh of relief.

""Carrie's are second best"" Jack said drawing two's on Carrie just like Anne's ""1's"" ""I like how long her's are, and how strong they seem."" As these last words left his mouth Jack bit hard onto the back side of Carrie's thigh, and the older woman almost toppled over.

""That means you're dead last"" Jack said looking at Taylor. ""Yours are pathetic, I figured they'd be the best since you're a dancer, but they aren't your calves are larger than your mom or sister's and not in a sexy way, your thighs are too thin, and lack definition, you're like a little chicken legged slut.""

Jack then wrote ""3"" on both of Taylor's legs, and on the inside of both thighs he wrote ""chicken legged slut.""

Jack then walked over to Carrie again and started to grab her ass. Carrie tried to move away this time and in return was pulled down to the floor by her hair, Jack rolled her onto her stomach and sat on her back as he felt the entire large white ass of the mother.

""Don't get up Carrie, or I will do something much worse next time."" Jack said.

Jack examined Anne and Taylor in the same way feeling the entire ass, and slipping a finger into Taylor who grunted in pain, but out of fear did not pull away.

""This time mommy wins the round, I would have expected a white upper-middle class suburbanite mom to have a flat pathetic ass, but Carrie you have just an incredible ghetto booty."" Jack said as he wrote a 1 and the words ""ghetto booty"" on each of Carrie's ass cheeks.

""Number two belongs to Ms. Anne"" Jack said as he wrote a two on Anne's ass cheeks. ""Which means you lose again Taylor."" Jack said as he wrote a 3 on Taylor's ass.

Jack moved his hands up to Taylor's waist and let his hands roam around her stomach, pinching at it before moving onto her sister and mother.

This time Jack walked to Taylor first started to speak, and then looked at Anne and said ""Anne wins again, that is such a toned, tight stomach, I bet I could bounce a quarter off of it. Carrie you were second, you're a mom and I thought having given birth to two kids you'd be doughy, but you avoided it."" Jack wrote a one and two on Anne and Carrie respectively.

""But Taylor loses again. I think you're going to be screwed little girl, literally and figuratively of course."" Jack wrote a three on Taylor's stomach before saying ""you've got no meat on you, it's like a fucking skeleton, Jack then wrote ""Skeletor"" on Taylor's stomach and the girl lost it.

Taylor dropped to the floor and starting bawling uncontrollably, crying and shrieking in embarrassment and fear. Jack reached down and slapped her across the face.

""Get a hold of yourself bitch. I'm not done with my game yet."" Jack snarled into Taylor's face.

Taylor spit at him and said ""just fucking do it already, I know you're going to rape me so just fucking get it over with.""

Jack reached down again and pulled Taylor to her feet by her throat. He then began to fondle her small 32A cup tits, after a minute or so of touching each he began to suck on both, and then bit down on her right breast hard enough to leave a deep mark.

Taylor's sobbing had almost subsided before the bite and then it was all fired up again uncontrollable and crippling. Jack let her cry as he grabbed, groped, prodded, and sucked on Anne and Carrie.

""Anne has just wonderful perky young tits"" Jack said while drawing a one on each of Anne's breasts ""Carrie has the big full B cups of a mother, that just drive me absolutely wild...and Taylor, well as always Taylor is the biggest disappointment in this family.""

Taylor tried to move away as Jack started to write her 3's and Jack hit her hard in the mouth for it, before Taylor's body had hit the floor Jack had leveled a kick into her side, and was pulling her upright. He finished writing a three on each of Taylor's breasts along with the phrases ""disobedient moron"" and ""mosquito bite tits"" on each breast as well.

Jack evaluated their faces in the same manner, giving Anne a one, and Carrie a three, while he gave Taylor a two he said to her ""you're not very pretty, your sister is just pretty, but you're attractive like a hate fucking victim is""

On Taylor's forehead Jack wrote ""fuck toy"" on her left cheek he wrote ""cum dump"" and on her right cheek he wrote ""slap here.""

""Only one thing left to look at,"" Jack said as he unzipped his pants. ""I know I said I'd only rape one of you, but how am I supposed to know who's pussy is best if I don't try all three.""

Jack stripped off his pants and let each woman to the couch in the side of the room. Jack rearranged their handcuffs so they were all tied to one another, and so that their legs were forced up in the air, and unable to close without pulling the other two open.

Jack slid his cock next to Carrie's slit first and said ""beg me to fuck you first, beg me or I will kill one of your daughters.""

Carrie quickly complied practically screaming ""no, no please no, just do me first, do only me, you don't have to hurt them anymore please.""

Jack slipped his cock into Carrie's cunt, astonished at how wet she had gotten. For a few minutes Jack rocked back and forth moving the older woman's cunt around his cock.

""You like this don't you?"" Jack said with a laugh.

""No"" Carrie said coldly.

""Fine then I'll just move on.""

Without another word Jack stuck his cock into Anne, who was not very wet, and screamed in pain as Jack entered her.

Jack looked at Taylor and said ""you better say sorry later, she won't get raped for long, but this hurts her and it's all your fault.""

Jack pulled out of Anne and said ""between the two of them Anne wins hands down, she's so tight, and enjoyable, you were good too Carrie, but fuck your kid is hands down the best pussy I've ever had.""

Jack then moved over to Taylor who's pussy was clearly wet, and had been fucked a few times before.

""Jesus Taylor, just looking at you I can tell how much of a hungry little slut you are. I know you're dead last in the rankings so I'll start with your mouth first and rank your cunt later. Now, let's make you clean the cum from your mommy and sissy off of me."" Jack said while again rearranging the cuffs so that Taylor could kneel on the floor in front of him.

Taylor starred at the cock that was now directly in front of her. Taylor hadn't noticed it before, but Jack was huge he was thicker than anyone she had ever seen, at least five inches in girth, and his cock head was another inch around than that, and his length was easily eight inches, if not more.

As Taylor starred in stunned amazement, Jack grabbed the back of her head with one hand, and with the other guided his massive dick to her mouth. ""Open the fuck up."" Jack said, as Taylor resisted.

Taylor compliant mostly out of fear, partially out of arousal. Taylor was only able to fit a third of his cock into her mouth, and did her best to move further down, or to swirl her tongue around it, but largely to no avail. After a few minutes of this Jack grew tired and pulled her backward violently before his huge muscular hand came down across the right side of her face.

The force of his slap knocked Taylor all the way to the floor, and onto her stomach. She could taste blood in her mouth from biting her tongue, and could feel the right side of her face swelling up. Before she knew it Jack had grabbed her around her waist, and pulled her onto all fours. Within less than thirty seconds Taylor felt his cock against her pussy.

""No, no, no please god no, you're too big, I don't want this please no."" Taylor cried out

""I can feel how wet you are, you clearly do want it."" Jack responded.

""No, I don't I don't I don't it's too much please no."" Taylor again pleaded.

""You do want it, I can tell that by how wet you are, and even if you don't this is what you get for being the ugliest of the Smith girls. This is what you get for causing this event. If your tits were nicer like your mom's or your sisters, or if your ass was bigger, and not pathetically small, or if your stomach didn't look like Skeletor's then maybe it would be a different story, but you lost, so you're stuck with this."" Jack said in a cold tone.

Without another word Jack thrust into Taylor, and unlike with Carrie and Anne where he had been slow and somewhat gentle with Taylor he was brutal, forceful, and animalistic. Jack's entire dick was thrust into Taylor, and like a jack rabbit pounding away Jack beat Taylor's cunt with his dick.

For fifteen minutes a constant slap, slap slapping noise was only broken up by Taylor's screams of pleasure and pain while being brought to multiple orgasms, and the cries and pleading of her mother, and sometimes her sister to stop. After fifteen minutes Jack picked Taylor up, while leaving his cock inside of her and set her on top of her mother.

""Suck your mommy's tits while I fuck you."" Jack said while panting heavily.

Taylor resisted at first, until Jack's hand hit Taylor's ass hard. For another two minutes Taylor resisted, but finally the blows on her ass became too much, and she quickly latched onto her mother's medium sized tits.

Carrie moaned in pleasure, while at the same time being horrified to feel her daughter's tears were hitting her skin while she was raped on top of her.

Jack only lasted a few more minutes, before feeling his own orgasm coming. Before coming he quickly pulled out of Taylor and stuck his dick back into Carrie's now extremely wet pussy where he blew a large load. After he did Jack pulled Taylor to the floor in front of her mother.

""Eat my cum out of her."" Jack said ""if not, you might have a new little brother or sister real soon.""

""No it's so gross, please no."" Taylor begged while turning her head to face Jack.

Jack roughly grabbed Taylor's hair, and she could feel strands being ripped from her head. ""Fucking do it, eat your mom, if you were sexier this wouldn't happen, if your body wasn't the worst in this room it wouldn't fucking happen, now do it.""

Taylor said ""I'm sorry mom"" and moved her mouth onto Carrie's cunt. Between the fucking her cunt had already taken, and how good it felt to be filled with a large load of cum, Carrie immediately had an orgasm from her daughter's tongue slipping into her slit.

""Awwww, did mommy like her little slut's tongue?"" Jack asked mockingly.",,2025-08-15T19:11:45.139531,3697,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-loving-husband-ch-11,The Loving Husband Ch. 11,Unknown Author,,,,,"The short synopsis of this story to date is included below, but reading the previous chapters may help. Also, in this chapter, I explore something that was recommended by a reviewer.

*****

This is the continuing story of a cuckquean, my wife, Ann. She had been reading cuckold stories on line and decided that she was a cuckquean, a kind of female cuckold. This was based on how enthralled and excited she became by imagining me having sex with other women. I was shocked, but she pursued it. She didn't show any tendencies toward the humiliation or denial part, but loved knowing I was having sex with other women. Apparently, this started with some voyeuristic tendencies about watching someone she was involved with have sex with another woman when she was in college and now she got off on thinking I was having sex with other women. I didn't understand it, but she pursued it and I started doing so.

In the last chapter, Ann's college roommate came to stay with us for a while. She is recently divorced and moving to our area to get a new job. I, of course, benefitted from this and got a chance to enjoy her again. Then, my departing personal assistant invited me out to a pre-bachelorette party that she and some friends were having and I managed to fuck her and two of her friends.

*****

I got dressed and left. I didn't see anything of Sandra or Carrie. I drove home, thinking about what a strange turn of events the last year has been. I also couldn't wait to tell Ann about the night. She was going to be as excited as I was.

When I arrived home, since it was Saturday, I thought that the kids would be up and raring to go. However, it was 7:30 and nobody was up yet so I went straight into the bathroom and showered. I got dressed without waking my wife, who was obviously sleeping in since her normal wake-up time was 7am no matter what. I went downstairs to the kitchen and starting making pancakes. It was my daughter's favorite and well, I did spoil her a little. She was a young replica of my wife and my little princess.

Jo came into the kitchen first. The basement bedrooms were just a little to the side of being right under the kitchen and she heard me moving around the kitchen and cooking. She was rubbing her eyes and yawning. I grinned. She was wearing an oversized t-shirt that came to mid-thigh and probably panties under it. I couldn't see it in reality, but in my mind's eye, I was seeing her delectable ass.

""Late night for you guys?""

""Yes. While you were out partying, we had a kid's party here and we stayed up late with them watching Disney movies and eating pizza.""

""What time did you guys get to bed?""

""About 1am.""

""Wow! That must have been quite a treat for the kids. We almost never have them up that late.""

""Yes, it was."" She now looked at me more closely and then back over her shoulder to see if anyone else was coming. She walked up behind me as I was starting to warm the griddle for the pancakes. She put her arms around me from behind, shoving her hands into my pants and groping for my cock. ""Did you get to fuck some young thing last night?""

""Oh, yes."" I was amazed at how comfortable Ann and Jo had become around the house with the physical relationships that were happening here. It was a little disconcerting at times.

She released me and I turned around. She grinned. ""Maybe you can tell me about it.""

""Which one? My former personal assistant? Or the threesome with the bride-to-be and her maid of honor? Although 'maid of honor' may be a misnomer for that little minx.""

She grinned and acted shocked. ""You fucked three of them last night?""

""Oh, yeah.""

""Wow, you were a busy man. Maybe you can't get it up this morning.""

""I'm not that old.""

""We'll see. So what happened?""

""You'll have to wait until later. Maybe you can listen as I tell Ann, too.""

She slapped me on the ass. ""Tease.""

""Says the woman living in my house wearing only a t-shirt to breakfast.""

Jo grinned. ""I'm wearing more than a t-shirt!"" To prove her point, she lifted her t-shirt up to her neck. ""See, I have on a sleeping bra."" And that's all she had on. No panties. I reached over to run my hand over her ass and she jumped back. ""No way. Not until I hear about last night.""

I shrugged my shoulders. ""No problem. I can wait.""

Jo slapped me on the arm. ""See, you are a tease.""

""Only because women have done that for centuries.""

""True."" She then sat down and spread her legs, showing me just a bit of her pussy.

I licked my lips and stared at her crotch. ""Maybe I don't want pancakes for breakfast, tease.""

""Promises, promises.""

About that time Amy, my 7-year-old came bounding into the kitchen. Jo quickly covered herself. ""I smell pancakes!"" She ran over to see the griddle.

I ruffled her hair. ""Yep, pancakes.""

She turned and hugged me around the waist and then turned to Jo. ""I have the best daddy in the world.""

Jo laughed. ""I know.""

Well, nothing makes your day any better than a comment like that from your child.

The rest of the troupe came traipsing in slowly and I made pancakes until they were all sated. They disappeared one by one into the den to watch cartoons until it was just me, Ann, and Jo. The kids knew exactly which cartoons they wanted to watch.

Ann was wearing her robe over a t-shirt and I stood next to where she was sitting. ""Ann, did you know that Jo is not wearing panties under that t-shirt?""

Ann put her hand to her open mouth, faking a great shock at this. ""Why, you hussy, how dare you flaunt yourself in front of my husband."" Then Ann turned to me. ""And how is it that you know this?""

""She showed me.""

Ann turned to Jo. ""What a slut.""

Jo grinned. ""I'm beginning to embrace that - a little.""

""Yes, you are.""

I turned and started cleaning up the kitchen. We had nothing planned today. Jo and Ann just talked and I wasn't paying too much attention. Finally, when I finished, Jo came up to me and put her hand on my crotch. ""I'll see you,"" she looked down, ""and this later."" She giggled and left the room.

Ann came over. ""I need to have a talk with that woman about being too brazen."" I think she was joking - a little. ""Now you need to take your horny wife upstairs and tell her about last night.""

I pulled her in for a kiss. ""Yes, dear.""

Ann pulled away, grabbed my hand, and led me towards the stairs. ""Jo will watch the kids for a while.""

We went into the bedroom and Ann undressed. I did, too, and crawled into bed. I sat up against the headboard and put a pillow behind me. I then motioned Ann over and she crawled in next to me.

""Come around here and sit between my legs."" She did and I turned her so that she was sitting facing away from me and leaning back against me.

She pulled the covers up over herself until she got warm. I put my hands around her and just held her for a few moments. ""You are a beautiful woman and I love you.""

She gave me a snarky laugh. ""You'd better!"" She leaned back, turning her head to me, and I kissed her. ""Now tell me about your evening with Mary. I've always thought she was a great person and pretty, but I never thought we'd be sitting her talking about you fucking her."" She turned back, laying her head on my shoulder and I started the story.

""Well, things didn't begin too well."" I told her about getting there for the pre-bachelorette party and how Mary got too drunk. I described holding her while she got sick, taking off her dress, and putting her to bed. Ann snuggled and told me what I good person I was for not taking liberties with a young drunk woman. I then described the scene of finding Sandra talking dirty about a threesome she and Carrie had had with her fiancé. She giggled. When I got to the part about Carrie coming over, stripping me, and then walking back out there to eat Sandra's pussy, Ann started wiggling. I started running my hands over her tits and I could tell she was lightly rubbing her pussy.

""You're going to tell me that she called you out there and you fucked her?""

""Yep."" Ann squirmed and I ran my hand down to her pussy. ""She got down on her knees and started eating Sandra out. After a couple of minutes she waved me over. I came up behind her and Sandra stared at me as Carrie ate her pussy. I knelt down and fucked Carrie until she came. Then she moved and I knee-walked forward and fucked Sandra, the bride to be.""

""Fuck!"" Ann was panting and groaning as I stroked her pussy with my right hand and pinched the nipple on her left tit with my left. ""Oh, god, what a bunch of dirty sluts!""

""Yes, they were great, dirty sluts."" I pushed two fingers into Ann as she continued to writhe and I knew she was close to an orgasm already. ""I fucked Sandra, her nice tits bouncing, until I filled her pretty - little - pussy - with - cum."" I punctuated the last few words with a thrust of my fingers and rubbed her clit and Ann convulsed into a big orgasm.

When she finally came down, I was still lightly rubbing her outer lips and her left tit. She took a deep breath. ""Wow. Then what?""

""When I was done, Carrie got down on the floor, knelt in front of Sandra and slurped my cock clean. Then she turned and ate Sandra's pussy until she had cleaned it up and Sandra came again.""

""Fuck, that's hot! I wish I had a movie of that.""

""It was pretty hot watching that, too. They were completely unfazed about inviting a stranger to fuck them.""

Ann turned back to me. ""So what time was that?""

""Well, everyone had gotten drunk early, so it was only about 1am when I went back to bed with Mary. Oh, and Carrie put her phone number into my phone if we want to call her.""

""Did anything ever happen with Mary?""

I grinned. ""Oh, yeah.""

""Well, come on."" Ann started making my hand, which was still on her pussy, start moving again. She wanted another orgasm while I talked about fucking other women.

""I woke up at 6am when Mary got up and went to the bathroom. She took off her bra, and evidently brushed her teeth. She crawled back into bed and immediately started playing with my cock.""

""Really?""

""Oh, yeah. She admitted to me that she had always liked me and had wanted to, and I quote, fuck the boss. I asked if that was because she liked me or the idea of doing something taboo at work like fucking the boss. She admitted that it was both.""

""Don't stop."" Ann was squirming under my fingers as I played with her pussy. I think her command was for both my story-telling and for the finger-fucking I was giving her.

I decided to change things up, so I slowly stopped playing with Ann and moved out from behind her. She groaned her disappointment. I got out of bed and pulled her by her feet to where her ass was at the edge, lined up with my cock. I rubbed it on her clit and she groaned.

""I then got out of bed and sat at the desk with a folder full of papers. I acted like I was at my desk at work, studying a report or something and ordered Mary to suck my cock. I let her do that and then told her that I was going to fuck her."" I lined my cock up with Ann's pussy and slowly buried it. ""I made her bend over the desk while I slapped her on the ass and fucked her until she came, telling her what a slut she was."" I was starting to fuck Ann hard now. I wanted to end my story with her and I both orgasming as I described Mary taking my cum down her throat. Ann just grunted and had her eyes closed, probably trying to picture what I was describing.

""After she came I told her that a good personal assistant cock-sucking cum slut didn't work all day with a messy pussy."" Ann groaned more and I started thrusting hard. This was going to work. ""So I told her that she had to kneel again and suck my nasty, pussy juice covered, wet cock until I came in her mouth.""

I started thrusting harder and Ann was getting close. Hell, so was I. ""She knelt there and I grabbed her head and face-fucked the little slut."" I was fucking Ann hard now.

I leaned over and got closer to Ann's face, whispering my description. Her eyes were still closed. ""Can you see it? Can you see me fucking Mary's pretty little mouth with my wet cock?"" Ann nodded. ""Then cum for me again as you picture this: my cock swelling and spewing my cum into pretty little Mary's slutty little mouth."" I was almost laying on Ann now and she had her legs pulled way back. I was humping her with my hips, grinding on her. ""I'm going to cum and fill up your hot fucking pussy now.""

As soon as I finished that statement Ann started cumming. She tensed and thrashed as I kept fucking her through it and then came myself. It was amazing bringing her off like that. When I came I just buried my cock in her and spurted and spurted. By the time I finished I realized that I had a very hard hold on her thighs. I looked down and released her legs. I was breathing hard and she was panting, too.

Finally, Ann looked up at me and smiled. ""That was fucking amazing.""

""Yes, it was.""

""I'm going to have to have that girl over and make her wait on you in your little office like a good secretarial slut.""

""I like the sound of that.""

Ann rose up on her elbows. ""But I have to convince her to let me record it. I need a new movie of you fucking some young thing.""

""You will have to bring that up with Mary.""

""Oh, I will.""

I lay back down on the bed and Ann curled up against me, laying her head on my chest. We covered up and relaxed for a couple of minutes. Finally, Ann said it was time to get moving and got up to take a shower. As soon as the water started running, Jo came into the bedroom. She eyed me and then walked over and pulled the covers back. She stared hungrily at my cock.

""Can I help you?"" I smirked.

Jo leant over and immediately sucked on my cock. It was soft and small so it easily fit into her mouth. She sucked only for a few seconds. ""Mmmm. Pussy-soaked cock. I think I like that.""

I took Jo's hand and held it in mine. ""Jo, is everything okay? Are you okay with this considering how you and you-know-who broke up and got divorced?""

Jo looked at me seriously. ""Yes, it's fine. I wouldn't have said so a few months ago, but after discussing this at length with Ann, I'm fine with it. I don't understand, but accept her position.""

""Yes, but what about you getting back out onto the market?""

She looked at me thoughtfully for a long time. ""Well, I look at it this way. I'm a sexual woman. I like sex and the physicality that comes with that kind of a relationship. Since I just divorced, you provide me the outlet without getting too horny or desirous of a physical relationship until I'm ready to get to that point with someone I'm dating. I can date without worrying about when I'll next get laid or have a good orgasm by someone other than me. I won't make any decisions about the man I'm dating based on wanting to have sex. Make sense?""

Ann had come out of the bathroom and was standing there wrapped in a towel. ""Makes perfect sense.""

Jo turned at the sound of her voice. ""You don't mind, right?""

Ann grinned. ""Not as long as you let me watch most of the time.""

""Just most of the time?""

Ann giggled. ""Yeah.""

I got up and headed for the bathroom. ""Right now we have four little ones about 50 feet away that aren't going to wait all day for the grown-ups to be done playing, so I'd better get moving.""

The next week was pretty uneventful. Things at work were going pretty well and my new assistant was a nice woman in her mid-30s who was re-entering the workforce after having had two children. She had a degree in English Literature, but hadn't found much to do with that after not having worked for 8 years. She certainly knew how to clean up the grammar on the memos that my colleagues were producing. She was also great at arranging my schedule. She was organized and efficient. A good find for what we were paying her. I was going to have to up her salary quickly to keep her.

I got home the next Friday and Ann and Jo were arranging for a trip to some museums for the kids. They figured out which ones and that they were going on Sunday. Finally, the arrangements having been made, they told me that Jo was taking the kids and that Ann and I had a special engagement on Sunday. I frowned and asked what it was, but they giggled and refused to tell me.

When Sunday came, we got up, made some breakfast and got all the kids out the door by about 10am. That was pretty good with four small children. Jo's kids were getting used to me and Beth was even comfortable around me. Ann got dressed in a cute black skirt and nice blouse and had me get into a pair of dress pants and dress shirt. Fortunately, I didn't have to wear a tie.

After the kids left, my wife turned to me with a grin. ""Okay, let's go."" She leaned over and picked up a small bag and turned toward the door.

""Where are we going?""

""You'll see.""

She led me out to her car and we got in. She drove and within a couple of minutes I knew we were heading to my office.

""What have you done, you little sneak?""

Ann grinned. ""You'll see.""

We pulled up, parked, entered the building, and made our way to my office. Ann opened the bag and pulled out our digital movie camera. Now I knew something sexual was going on with Ann. Did she get in touch with Mary? Was she going to meet us there?

Ann came over to me. ""Let's go over to your chair."" I did so and Ann followed me. She told me to remain standing. Then knelt, unlatched my belt, opened my pants, and dropped them to the floor around my ankles. She grinned at me as she then pulled my boxers down as well. She looked up and kissed my cock on the head. ""Now sit down in your chair and act like you are doing work. When your assistant comes in, she will come around the side of your desk with some papers. You push back and let her see your cock. She'll drop to suck it and I'll take it from there."" Ann looked around. ""Ready?""

I chuckled. ""I guess so. Are you going to be my assistant today?""

Ann grinned and didn't say a word. She picked up the video camera and walked out of my door, leaving me sitting there with a partial woody, sitting in my cold leather chair.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and it opened. I stared as in walked Mary's friend Carrie in a short skirt and tight blouse. She was a voluptuous vision. Her legs were well shown off with the heels and short skirt and her tits were bouncing freely under her blouse. As soon as she cleared the door, another woman, one I didn't know, came in right behind her carrying the video camera. She followed Carrie closely.

This was definitely a surprise. I waited until Carrie came around the side with some papers. The woman with the video camera followed so that she could get both of us from the side of the desk.

""Here are those papers you wanted, Mr. T."" She put some papers on my desk.

I pushed back from the desk and turned my chair so that I was facing her and my nude bottom half was on display, my pants around my ankles. ""Thanks, Carrie.""

Carrie grinned when she saw my display. ""Oh, Mr. T. It looks to me like you need some assistance with a problem that you are having.""

""Yes, I do. I have too much cum in my balls and I can't think straight with a hot young wench like you working for me.""

""Well, we'll just have to see what we can do about that."" Carrie walked over to the couch in my office and grabbed a cushion off it. She then walked back over and dropped it at my feet. ""My knees can't take this hard floor, Mr. T."" And with that she dropped down onto the cushion and stared at my cock. It was slowly lengthening. ""Mmmm. I love a hard cock in the morning."" She leaned forward and took it into her mouth. It became fully hard quickly. She lifted off it for a second. ""You have such a nice perfect cock for fucking and sucking, Mr. T.""

""Thanks.""

Carrie went back to licking and sucking my cock. I just sat there and watched as the videographer moved to a better position to get a shot of Carrie working my cock over.",,2025-08-15T19:11:51.180010,3788,

Hello!

If you're just tuning in, be warned that Beltane is a story that crosses into many different fetishes and dynamics. Two staples you can expect pretty much throughout are gentle femdom and cumplay, but also included are cuckqueaning, piss, maledom, f on m cnc, breeding, and a smattering of more mild things like anal, deepthroating, facesitting, and fishnets. There are also some themes of occultism, ritual, and magic that are less overt and more true to life than fantasy. Beltane has been, and is, an exercise in incorporating and moving between these things rather than leaning on just one. If you're looking for any of these things individually in abundance, this may not be your favorite story. But if you're on board for some twists, turns, bodily fluids, and a pagan fucktacular bacchanal across a variety of kinks, well...

Enjoy!

-TheDaggerAndTheCup

*****

I awoke to the somber grey light of morning and found Ann was already gone. I hadn't heard her get up or shut the door. She had obediently followed Gemma's instructions. I wondered if she had showered before she left.

Gemma lay angelically curled in the sheets. I sat and watched her breathe as I remembered everything we had already done in our brief tryst and wondered what would come next. What black magic she was cooking up behind her eyelids? And what would become of Ann? I wasn't sure if she was now a regular part of our sex, or if it had been a one-time thing. And

christ

, I had finals the following week. The last round of finals before graduating college, and then what? The entirety of the future was uncertain. As I sat watching the most powerful woman I had ever known dream, I knew that as soon as I got out of the bed, everything would be up in the air. A daunting world of possibilities loomed outside that bubble of humid bodily warmth. Gemma's form dilated and compressed as breath filled and vacated her. It would work itself out.

I slipped out from under the covers and went to make bacon. Gemma got up ten minutes later and slinked quietly into the kitchen, grabbing a handful of my ass. I felt the softness of her skin brush against mine as her whispered voice filled my ear.

""Good morning, lover boy.""

My cheeks flushed. Her forwardness was, as always, disarming. I turned and saw her as she was every morning, beheaded and unceremonious and naked. My eyes ran up and down her unconsciously, taking in every detail. Admiring her tattoos, the way her pierced nipples stood at attention as they transitioned from the warmth under the covers to room temperature. Her dainty, perfectly-shaped feet, her toenails painted black as they always were. The smooth, fluid curves of her legs, her stomach, her back, her neck. The tuft of her pubic hair, darker in color than her bleached blonde head. And the glistening trail of wetness between her legs as my cum ran out of her pussy and ass. My cock twitched. I wanted more of her.

""Oh my GOD you're wearing an apron! You are so cute right now I just want to-""

Her hands ran over me. I was, indeed, naked except for an apron. Her fingers slid under it and she cupped my manhood.

""I'm cooking bacon, it's for the grease! Hey-""

She was fondling me with one hand, the other gripping handfuls of my ass, and kissing and biting up my arm to my shoulder.

""There's coffee in the pot if you want some. Let me work here!""

She sunk her teeth into my shoulder, clearly trying to get a rise out of me.

""Fuck, ow!"" I yelped, more surprised than hurt.

She let me go and looked up at me playfully. ""You're just too much fun. I may just have coffee, I need to run. Busy week ahead.""

I turned back to the pan and flipped the crackling strips of pink meat. ""No worries. Have you got a lot of finals?""

""Well, that,"" she said. I could hear her putting her things back into the bag she had brought with her. ""And we have a ritual we need to prepare for.""

Ritual?

""A ritual?"" I shouted into the other room.

""Yes, sweet boy."" Her voice was right behind me all of a sudden. ""I decided this morning. We're going to have a Beltane celebration."" Her hands were slithering around me, back underneath the apron. The length of her body was pressed against my back. I felt her rise onto her toes and her voice was a whisper on the back of my neck. ""And you're going to help me work some magic."" I had goosebumps. Her fingers braided through my chest hair, over my stomach, to my cock, to my inner thighs. I was stiffening under the apron.

""Magic?"" I asked, watching the bacon as it crisped in the pan.

""It'll be fun,"" her breath on my neck was giving me goosebumps everywhere. ""Trust me.""

Her hand had wrapped around my cock and was holding me firmly at the base. The other was working its way between my balls and my thigh to my perineum, stroking skin that no other woman had ever touched. Out of my foggy brain came a memory of something she had said on our first date.

""Just looking for able bodies to sacrifice, you know.""

I sighed, enraptured, bracing myself as I leaned forward. The bacon was close to burning. I moved the pan off the burner as Gemma's hand began sliding up and down the length of my shaft. I was completely stiff, my head filled with a haze. She was working magic on me already. ""You'll help me, won't you, sweet boy?""

I had agreed when she had asked me the first time. It had sounded hot then, and if I was being honest, it sounded hot now. I was panting, trying to maintain my composure. I nodded. ""Uh-huh.""

""Good boy."" She responded. Her fingers were again at the edge of my asshole. Her left hand rolled over the head of my cock, stimulating what she knew was my most sensitive place. ""Maybe we can have our little cucktoy come and watch again. What do you think?""

I was shrouded in a haze of sensation as she worked me with her skilled hands. I vaguely understood the question. She wanted to cuck my ex again. I had gotten all the vengeful pleasure I had ever wanted out of the night prior. Having Ann around again would mean the three of us were a unit, and I wasn't sure that's what I wanted. But Gemma wanted it. And I wanted to give Gemma what she wanted.

""O-okay,"" I affirmed, trying to keep it together. I could feel an orgasm building in me.

How does she already have me ready to come?

I wondered. It was astounding to me that my body was even ready for more after the workout it had had the night before.

""Say it like you mean it,"" Gemma whispered, a playful hostility creeping into her voice.

Her hand left my cock for a second. I felt her arm circle around me until it was between us, and then back under the apron. Her fingers encircled me again, her hand wet. I shuddered as I realized she had caught some of my own cum as it dripped out of her and was now using it to jack me off. She stroked me purposefully, gliding up and down my shaft in firm, graceful strokes. Her other hand wormed out from between my balls and redoubled its approach from behind, tracing slow rings around my asshole. I gasped audibly.

""YesMommy,"" the words tumbled out of my mouth hurriedly.

""Gooood boyyyy,"" she praised. Her hand slid up to my head and rolled over it. ""Are on edge, my sweet?""

""Yes, Mommy,"" I confessed. I wondered how she could have known before remembering that she always knew, and it never made sense. I was starting to accept that she had some kind of supernatural understanding of things that I just couldn't understand.

""Good boy. Do you want to come?""

""Y-yes, Mommy, yes please.""

Her hand stilled suddenly and lifted off of my cock. A tense breath forced its way out of me as I felt myself dangle over the edge, the tantalizing release of orgasm just out of reach.

""I want you to make me come first."" She whispered. I was all goosebumps again.

I heard her walk into the living room. I turned to see her sit on the couch, lifting her legs and spreading them, setting her feet on either side of her. I ripped off the apron and strode after her. I knelt down, cock in hand, ready to cum inside her again when she covered herself suddenly. My eyes met hers and she shook her head. The fingers of her other hand raked through my hair.

""I'm a little sore from yesterday, sweet boy. I want you to lick me.""

She had that same telltale coy grin on her face that she had when bullying Ann the night before. Her fingers clutched me by the hair and pulled my head down until I was eye level with her pussy.

Her hand lifted up and away, baring herself to me. Her lips and asshole were slick with the last night's cum, which was still seeping out of both her holes. As I sat, a tiny orb of marbled white liquid pulsed out of her opening and sat in the horseshoe where her labia met. I looked up at her. I was still at the very least lukewarm about tasting my own cum and she could tell.

""Come on, sweet boy. Do it for me?""

I sighed inwardly.

What does it really matter, anyway?

I thought,

it's not gonna kill you

.

""Oh, fuck it,"" I said.

I stuck out my tongue and got to work, lapping up the drop waiting at the apex of her lips and licking up to her clit. It was salty-sweet and viscous on my tongue. I could also taste her fluids. It was the taste of our sex, the sum total of our congress, our bodies mixing together. To my chagrin, my cock bobbed.

""Yeessssss, ohhh, that's such a good boy, look at you."" She praised me as I yielded to her will, licking and sucking at her soft, welcoming furrows, the taste of my own cum filling my mouth.

Her hand gripped me tighter by the hair, directing my head up and down as she saw fit. She pushed me back down to her opening and I stuffed my tongue inside, tasting the reservoir of salty liquid I had pumped into her the night before. It ran down my tongue into my throat.

""Fffuck. That's such a good boy, eat that freshly fucked pussy for me."" She was beginning to moan. I had the feeling it wouldn't take long.

I put my back into it, lathering her with my tongue from bottom to top. I sucked her clit into my mouth, circling and caressing it. She pushed me back down and I stuck my tongue back inside her, curling it up and fucking her with it as best as I could.

""Oh FUCK! Yes, that's it, fucking eat it, you slut, god, unhh-"" she moaned wildly as her head rolled back.

In fairness, I felt like a slut. But or her, I didn't mind. If she wanted me to be a slut, I was her slut. I gripped my cock in my hands and started jacking myself off, getting off on her command of me. She pushed me even lower and I licked her ass clean, lapping away my cum and pleasing her rim. I pressed my tongue into her cautiously, only enough to penetrate the first ring. Her moans had grown to a chorus. She pulled me back up and I licked her from her asshole to her clit, bathing her clean with my tongue. She pushed me into her clit and I worked at it feverishly, lathing her in firm, quick brushstrokes.

""I'm gonna-"" she moaned. It felt like she was going to rip my hair out. ""OHH-""

She came loudly and I could feel her walls flexing. She pulled my head up and down and I simply pushed my tongue out into a broad fan, letting her facefuck me. Beads of cum exuded from her opening and one by one I licked them up. She ground her hips into my face and closed her thighs around me, using me like a toy. I edged myself as she had her way and then pulled my hands off myself, wanting to be ready for her when she was done.

Slowly she came down. She released me and then pulled me to her face, kissing me deeply, her tongue exploring my mouth.

""Fuck, that was so fucking hot. God, you are such a

good

boy. I'm so proud of you, baby.""

I felt my face get red hot.

Baby?

She had never once called me that. I looked away bashfully.

""You did so good for me,

oh

my

god

."" She kissed me again, passionately and vigorously. ""Okay, let's get you taken care of. Go bring me a condom.""

""A con-"" I started, confused

She interrupted me. ""Yes, just trust me, bring it to me now.""

My ears were hot. ""Yes, Mommy,"" I responded.

I walked into the bathroom and fished out what she had asked for. When I came back she was sitting on the couch, legs spread wide. She patted the space in between her thighs, a wide smile on her face. I sat where she had gestured and she took the condom from me, opening it and setting it on my thigh.

""I want another souvenir from you."" She whispered into my ear again, her words syrupy.

Her legs wrapped around me and she hooked my inner thighs with her feet, parting my legs. Her hands snaked over my skin to my cock. She couldn't fit the entire thing in both hands, probably just as much for how big I am as for how small her hands were. She started working it again, confidently milking me in that trained way she had.

""You're going to tell me when you're on edge, okay?""

I was already close. ""Yes, Mommy.""

Her left hand worked up my shaft to my head, rolling her fingers over the lip of my head. Her right hand moved lower, cupping my balls before venturing back to my asshole. She stroked it gingerly, just as before, as if she was just doing it to acknowledge that I would let her. Her feet ran up my thighs, meeting at my balls. She pointed and then curled her toes, stimulating my balls with them, the touch so light it was barely there. My breathing was getting quicker. I had never felt so wrapped up in a woman's body. She was holding me with her whole frame, using everything at her disposal to pleasure me. My head rolled back and I let out a low moan.

""Are you on edge, good boy?""

""Yes- yes, Mommy, I'm edging,"" I said urgently.

It occurred to me I may have let myself go too long without telling her, but she knew what she was doing. Her hand flitted from my cock to the condom and rolled it over the tip. Her fit slid down and away from my balls and her other hand glided back to my cock, gripping me firmly at the base. She bobbed her hand up and down, holding me at the brink coaxingly. Her spare hand folded back the condom just enough to access the lip of my head. She spit into her hand and enclosed it in the ring of her finger and thumb. She rotated it back and forth, applying just enough pressure, moving just slowly enough. I was ready for her whenever she gave the word.

""Come."" She commanded.

I burst. My head rolled back again, a throaty moan rising out of me. I pulsed, hard, my cock thrashing up toward my body. Her hand tightened around the base, trapping my cum inside while she rolled the condom down, the stimulation of her hand adding to the pleasure I was feeling. She let go, allowing me to fill the condom.

And I did. Despite the two intense orgasms I had had the night before, this one was just as big, if not bigger. If I had had the brain power to spare, I would have still been wondering how it was possible for the human body to produce so much cum. She held the condom tight around me, jacking me off as I filled it. Hot spurts filled the balloon. Gemma whispered encouragingly to me as I did.

When I had finished, she shucked it off, trapping all the cum in the tip of the condom. She tied it in a knot and dangled it back and forth, marvelling at it.

""That's so fucking much. You're such a good boy for me.""

She kissed me behind the ear and trailed away down my neck, nibbling and biting at me. I was lost in the afterglow. Suddenly she sprang up.

""Alright, let me get a cup of coffee and then I need to get out the door. Let me put this somewhere safe...""

She put her leg up on my knee and spread her labia, pushing the balloon of cum inside. The knotted end hung out of her opening discreetly. I stared up at her, slackjawed. Just when I thought I had seen it all, she went and blew my mind all over again. She bit her lip and smiled down at me, leaning in for a quick kiss. She walked to the bag she had left on the floor and started fishing clothes out of it, not bothering to put on underwear before donning a pair of tights and a loose-fitting shirt.

""Fix me a cup of coffee, would you? I really do need to get going.""

I snapped out of it and stood up. It had only been ten minutes or so, but somehow the bacon on the stove felt lightyears away. I tried to get myself back to normal as I fetched her a cup of coffee. I set it out and went to put pants on. When I walked back into the kitchen she was sitting at the table, sipping, her hair brushed and pulled back into a ponytail. She looked up at me knowingly.

""Hey um,"" I began, sheepishly, ""what do you do with that uh, you know, my cum?""

I began plating my bacon, trying not to look too curious. A smile spread over Gemma's face.

""Don't worry, you'll see.""

I sat down next to her and began eating, my mind switching from sex to the list of things I had to do, papers to write, papers to read, notes to look over. Gemma took a deep sip and reached a hand out, touching my wrist.

""I'm not going to get to see you much this week. But I want you to keep cumming for me. And I want you to bring it to me, just like before. Can you do that?""

I blushed again. I would have been cumming for her had she asked me to or not. ""Um, yeah, of course.""

She smiled. ""Good. I've gotta jet now, lots to do. One last thing, will you send me Ann's number?""

I was taken aback. My instinct was to say no, why would she need that? But the look in her eyes read

""trust me""

, the two words from her (aside from ""good boy"") that I seemed unable to resist.

""Um. Sure, yeah, okay. Just a second.""

I reached for my phone. Gemma walked around the table and grabbed my jaw, gently guiding my face to hers. She kissed me one last time, tenderly. Her hand lingered on my cheek and she stared into my eyes.

""See you real soon."" She said. She turned and started toward the door.

I heard it open. ""Have a good day today, baby!"" She shouted as she walked out the door.

I thought over everything for a moment. The word echoed in my mind. I thought about how Gemma had spoken to Ann, the way she had talked about us. I thought about how much of myself I had already given over to her, and how much she had given in return. How intimate we had become, if almost exclusively through the physical expression of intimacy. It had all happened so fast, but it was a steady escalation. We were growing closer, through our bodies. I thought about how she had kissed me just now. There was no doubting that it wasn't just a hookup anymore. Something was growing between us. I had assumed that we were essentially fuck buddies, but... there was that word. That

she

had used, not me. And not just once. Twice. And not just during sex. It wasn't a heat-of-the-moment slip-up. She had done it on purpose.

Baby.

I thought about how I felt about her. How I had been so hungry for pussy after Ann, and now all I wanted was more of Gemma. Constantly. And the more of her I had, the more I was able to give. And the more I gave her, the more I wanted. It was a feedback loop. I thought, and thought, and thought, and all the while that word bounced around in my skull.

Baby?

""Wait, is Gemma my girlfriend?"" I asked aloud, to no one in particular.",,2025-08-15T19:12:05.367726,3628,

* * *

Selene didn't sleep very well after her dream the previous night. She managed to sleep for a reasonable length of time, but it wasn't good sleep. She woke up more than once with that dream on her mind, and the strangeness of it boggled her mind. The more she thought about it, the less it made sense. She spent rather a long time thinking about it after she woke, until she realized that she wasn't getting back to sleep.

She got up not long after sunrise, dreading going onto the weather deck with the steady pitter-patter of rain that was surely soaking every inch of the airship that wasn't below decks. She figured that her choice was to either get sopping wet, or stay below decks with nothing to do and not much room to spar.

This world didn't even have umbrellas.

She trudged up the stairs to the weather deck and looked out the door. The rain was coming down pretty consistently, though fortunately it was a warm day. It wasn't exactly a heavy rain, but it was one of those 'soaking rains' that tended to last all day. The only bright side was that the warm weather meant you wouldn't get a chill, but you

would

get soaked.

Ugh.

That seemed a perfect complement to her poor night's sleep

Ethan and his wives were sitting around where the breakfast fire usually was, apparently not bothered by the rain very much. Serif was also there, though Anthiel was on the quarterdeck and Raklan was elsewhere. It took Selene a moment to realize that while every one of the ladies had hair that looked like she'd just stepped out of the shower, their clothes looked relatively dry. Not perfectly dry, but relatively dry.

How the...?

She shook her head, still not wanting to get soaked. Still, she was hungry so she stepped out and immediately felt what would probably be the norm for the day.

Wet.

She walked over to the circle, grabbed a barrel of pickles and pulled one out, making sure to re-cover it quickly.

""Good morning Selene."" Ethan said cheerily.

""Wet morning is more like it."" She said as she took a large bite of the pickle and then looked at the mostly dry ladies. ""How the hell are your clothes so dry?""

""It's a side effect of the self-repairing enchantment."" Beth replied.

""How the hell does a self-repairing enchantment keep clothes dry?""

The blonde looked at Alana.

""It's because 'self-repairing' is a bit of misnomer."" The wood elf said when she had finished chewing. ""It actually takes a... I think you would call it a 'snapshot' of the way the item is when it's enchanted, and then always tries to return it to that state if it changes from that state.""

""Oh, and those dresses were enchanted dry, so they want to stay dry. Yeah, that makes sense."" Selene sighed and then took another bite of her pickle.

This morning, Selene was sitting next to Rachel, who was next to Alana, who was next to Ethan. He looked at the distance between them, then shrugged and extended his wing, holding it above her head and creating an instant rain shield for her.

""Thank you."" She said, slightly caught off guard by his thoughtfulness. She supposed that she shouldn't be of course, and it was a nice gesture. She smiled at him, even despite her mood.

""Selene, what's wrong?"" Kendra asked. ""You seem uncharacteristically grumpy this morning.""

""I had a bad dream.""

""Oh?"" The dragon huntress eyed her. ""How bad?""

""Bad."" She recounted the dream, mostly hitting the highlights. ""I felt like I needed a shower by the end.""

""Well, I can move my wing."" Ethan winked.

""You can, your wing muscles must be getting tired and I'm already soaked."" She said, feeling a bit bad that he was being so nice to her when she couldn't reciprocate.

""I can fly for hours."" He pointed out, not moving the wing. ""Don't worry about it.""

""That's a really weird dream."" Rachel said after several seconds. ""Like, really weird.""

""You're telling me."" The Brazilian woman shook her head. ""I've never had a dream that was so weird before, have you?""

The redhead didn't answer right away, which instantly drew the eyes of the two blonde teens.

""You had a weird dream too?"" Beth asked.

""What was it?"" Taloni echoed.

""Well, it wasn't recently."" The mage replied. ""But I suppose it's time I told you all about it. I once had two dreams the same night, and it was the night I met Gabriella...""

The redhead recounted both dreams to a captive audience.

""Wow, I never knew you were dealing with that."" Alana said when she had finished. ""Some of what happened with you around then makes a lot more sense now.""

""I wanted to tell you, but we weren't..."" Rachel hesitated, then looked at the wood elf. ""Well, we're a lot closer now."" She blushed.

Alana took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.

She didn't let go.

""Anyone else have a strange dream?"" Ethan asked.

""Um, I did once."" Kendra said hesitantly.

All eyes turned to her.

""It was quite a while ago, around when the Argo visited Gonorran's camp."" The dragon huntress said. ""I was dancing in a ballroom which was somehow located on the lower deck of my airship.""

""That airship?"" Ethan chuckled as he pointed to the canoe-sized airship which was lashed to the deck of the Argo near the bow.

""Yeah; it was a dream."" She shrugged, and her eyes got a little light behind them as she said the next sentence to him. ""You and I danced a whole dance together, and it was so much fun. Then Alana came up with a baby girl, Ruth I guess. She let me hold her and that's when I realized that everyone in the ballroom had disappeared. I ran out the doors, but somehow ended up on a battlefield. There were dead bodies everywhere, and small fires, and smoke was drifting across the battlefield. The firelight gave a red cast to the area, and it almost looked like there was blood in the air.""

""That sounds eerily familiar to a dream I once had."" Ethan grimaced. ""It was not long after I came to the Ten Kingdoms, right before I woke up after bonding to Alana.""

""Oh?"" Selene asked. This was starting to get weird and she didn't know what to make of it.

""Yeah."" He nodded. ""It was almost exactly as you described, and I was there fighting a black dragon.""

Kendra sucked in her breath. ""Was he using a mace and shield, and you were using a sword that sort of glowed with an inner light?""

""How did you..."" Ethan's jaw dropped. ""You saw the same thing?""

""If that's what you saw, then yes.""

""It wasn't exactly the same though."" He frowned. ""The sword that glowed with an inner light in your dream sounds like the angelic blade Aharown, but I saw myself wielding what I now think was my dragon steel sword and a shield.""

""I don't think you had a shield. Kendra replied. ""If I recall correctly, you were only using the glowing sword and it wasn't that large.""

Everyone looked around at everyone else as the rain continued to fall, the almost cheerful pitter-patter of the raindrops belying the somber mood. Selene almost couldn't believe her ears. Did these people ever have a normal day?

""Do... do you think it was prophetic?"" Taloni asked quietly.

""Dear Illuminar in heaven, I hope not."" Kendra said vehemently. ""I was still holding Ruth on the battlefield.""

Alana put a hand protectively over her womb. ""You were?""

Kendra nodded. ""Gabriella told me to protect the baby, and then black dragon saw me and came after me. I tried running, but he was too fast. He knocked me to the ground and I shielded Ruth with my body as he started to swing his mace. That's when I woke up.""

Ethan took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. ""I hope that's not prophetic.""

""If I may?"" Rachel interjected.

""Please."" Ethan and Alana said at the same time. The mood was somber enough that no one even batted an eye at their synchronicity, Selene least of all.

The redhead continued. ""Gabriella told me something about my dreams that I think might apply to your dreams too, since they were slightly different from each other.""

""What did she tell you?"" Beth asked.

""She said."" Rachel closed her eyes for several seconds, then quoted: ""While the specifics aren't necessarily accurate, the generalities are."" She looked at them. ""She then told me that the dreams didn't tell me exactly what would happen, but instead gave a general impression of what things would be like.""

""So, me fighting the black dragon on a large battlefield."" Ethan said. ""And possibly some threat to Ruth?""

Alana looked frozen in place, horror etched onto her face and she put both hands protectively over her womb. ""No, not Ruth.""

""You're damn right not Ruth."" Ethan growled. ""If anyone tried to hurt her, I'd--""

""--rip him limb from

fucking

limb."" Selene finished, imitating the 'quiet but deadly' tone he usually used when making that particular threat. ""You really don't do things halfway, do you?""

""When it involves the safety of my family, fuck no."" He stated flatly.

Selene nodded, that fact not bothering her in the slightest. In fact, she wholeheartedly approved after what had happened to her brother.

""Um, Master."" Taloni said tentatively, breaking the silence that had fallen after that pronouncement.

""What?"" He looked at her.

""Um, this is really serious and I don't want anything to happen to you or Ruth, but can I suggest something?""

""Go ahead.""

""Um, the book of Light says: 'Don't borrow problems from tomorrow; today has enough troubles to worry about.' It's good that we know bad things are coming because we can prepare for them."" The Fey's wings fluttered nervously. ""But I don't think we should miss the good things that we have now because there are bad things coming in the future.""

Selene looked at the Fey teen, her respect for her increasing by leaps and bounds.

Wow.

That was a really mature way to look at it.

""That's really good advice."" Ethan took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""Is that why you're always so cheerful? Because you don't let tomorrow's problems bother you today?""

""Partially Master. But I trust Illuminar to take care of us too, which also helps. I'm not saying we shouldn't prepare, or plan, or take precautions, but worrying now won't improve a problem later.""

""You're absolutely right."" Ethan took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""I can get ready for what's coming while appreciating what I have now."" He looked around at his wives and smiled.

Selene had to admit that was a really great way to look at things. She could tell that Alana was having a bit more trouble doing that since the wood elf's hand was still over her womb, but even she looked calmer than she had a minute ago.

""Ruth will be okay."" The wood elf said after several seconds. ""I had a dream with Gabriella where she said I would nurse the baby in my womb; that she would be safe.""

Ethan breathed a sigh of relief, and a similar sentiment was echoed in various way by most everyone.

""But what about Master?"" The Fey teen asked. ""Did Gabriella say anything about him?""

Alana grimaced and shook her head.

Everyone looked at Ethan.

Silence fell for several seconds after she said this, and everyone seemed to be processing. Selene knew she was. Finally, Ethan himself broke it.

""Ruth will be safe, and we should focus on the present and what we do have."" He nodded to himself, then turned to Kendra. ""So, you really like to dance?""

""Yes Drago, I really do.""

He turned to Selene. ""Do you mind if I rob you of your umbrella?""

She shrugged. ""It's your wing.""

He retracted it, stood, and then held a hand out to Kendra. ""May I have this dance?""

She looked around. ""There's no music.""

""Anthiel."" Ethan called up to the quarterdeck where the high elf pilot was. ""Could you provide a tune so I can dance with my wife?""

""Certainly captain."" She came down the stairs to the main deck and then ducked just inside the doorway to the lower decks so she was out of the rain. Then she produced an instrument that looked like small recorder and started playing.

""May I have this dance?"" He asked the dragon huntress again.

""It's raining."" She pointed out.

""It is."" He nodded. ""And?""

""Thank you Drago."" She replied as she rose gracefully to her feet, a smile starting to form on her face.

* * *

Taloni felt herself grin in spite of what they'd just learned as Master led Kendra out onto the middle of the Argo's deck. Her friend didn't look like she knew what to do with herself. She was grinning broadly, despite the rain and the heavy things just revealed.

""Do you really think of him as Master?"" Selene asked, shifting the Fey's attention.

""Of course I do."" She replied. ""He's 'Master' to me, now and forever. I rarely even use his name even when I'm thinking about him.""

""Okay."" The Brazilian woman shrugged, then like the rest of the ladies turned to watch Master and Kendra.

He had led her to an open area of the deck and then pulled her into the classic dancing frame. She put her hand on his arm, looking at him like she couldn't believe it.

Then they started dancing.

She was clearly the better dancer, though he did okay. Before long, Kendra was grinning silly and twirling in the rain. Her dress spun up when she did, and the water slid off of it in the most beautiful patterns; nearly as beautiful as the dragon huntress herself.

Taloni couldn't understand why Kendra thought her scars made her unattractive in some way. She looked amazing even with them. She just wished Kendra could see herself the way Taloni herself did; an amazing woman and a perfect older sister.

Well, that's how the Fey thought of her anyway.

It wasn't long before her fellow wives all stood up and wanted to dance too. However, with only one man and five women, the women soon ended up pairing off to dance. Taloni ended up dancing with Beth, both of them giggling a lot as they tried to figure out who would dance the man's part. Beth did because she was taller, and there was a lot of toe-stepping and more giggling as they tried to figure it out.

Alana and Rachel seemed a bit too timid to dance with each other, but eventually their husband switched partners and they each got a dance.

Taloni could tell that everyone was still a bit on edge after what they'd learned earlier, but they were all doing their best to be joyful in the moment, and it was good to see.

The Fey sighed.

She really loved her family.

* * *

""Mining camp sighted.""

Ethan resisted the urge to look since Raklan would surely take advantage of his distraction to score a hit in their sparring match. Dancing with his wives earlier in the morning had been a great distraction from the heavy revelations and was great fun -- Kendra seemed like she was still on cloud nine -- but eventually they had stopped. The rain hadn't though. It was still coming down, but it was more like a heavy drizzle than a heavy rain.

He had decided to spar since he needed all the practice he could get, and doubly so since the conversation earlier in the morning. Further, practice in the rain didn't happen that often during summer in the Ten Kingdoms and he wanted to take advantage.

On the other side of the mast, Selene and Serif were also sparring. The Brazilian woman never won against him of course -- no one did -- but she was getting better every day. She had a vast body of martial arts experience as a foundation, which probably explained how she was improving so fast.

Anthiel had taken pity on the drenched beauty and loaned her a dress that was self-repairing, and thus water resistant. It didn't fit her quite right since Anthiel was taller and differently proportioned, but it didn't look bad on her either. Honestly, with as gorgeous as she was, she could probably wear a burlap sack and be fetching.

Very fetching.

Raklan made his move, and Ethan reacted, parrying the blow and returning with a counter-blow of his own, which the larger man parried before disengaging. Their bouts were going more like that lately; not a quick victory but a series of exchanges before one of them won. It was still usually Raklan, but Ethan was starting to win more often. He wasn't using his strength enhancing armor or improved reflexes while training though. He could've done much better if he was, but Serif insisted his training would be more effective without them and he trusted the man when it came to combat.

""Touché"" Ethan called a minute later as Raklan's training blade smacked into his armor. The armor prevented the hits from hurting, but they were still scored as wins.

With the match done, Ethan turned his attention towards the mine.

Below him was a large rolling meadow that was the usual lush shade of green that covered Ivernia. There was a large, fast-moving stream running through it coming down from the mountains, though 'hills' probably would've been a more accurate description. He could see true mountains rising to the west of him, but it looked like the mine was on the tail end of the mountain range. Yeah, they were more like large, green, rocky hills than mountains.

The hills looked like Ireland.

Or maybe Scotland?

One of the two; maybe a combination of them. He'd see plenty of pictures of the two countries, and even some aerial footage on Earth. Everything he was seeing now made him think of the 'mountains' of either Scotland or Ireland. They were a lush, verdant green color, almost more so than the meadow below it. The hills started rather abruptly out of the land below, though the color change between the hills and meadow was more gradual.

He could see what looked like the entrance to a mine cut into the base of one of the large hills.

About three hundred yards north of the mine was a rise in the meadow, and on that rise was a walled town. The rise was perhaps a dozen feet above the plains around it, and the town looked like most of the other towns he'd seen in Ivernia. It looked run-down, but from lack of resources not a lack of care or lazy maintenance.

The wall around the town was palisade style, with long, thick, and straight tree trunks rising at least a dozen feet into the air and ending in sharp points. It looked like there might also be a crude form of barbed wire at the top too.

Projecting out and up from the north side of a portion of the wall was a very wide, very sturdy looking airship dock. It was almost thirty feet wide and rose well above the plains below, with plenty of room for an airship's lower mast. If an airship turned the crossbeams on its masts so they were in line with the keel, two airships could dock and simultaneously loaded and/or unloaded since the dock was so wide.

""What do you think Master?"" Taloni asked as she walked up behind him.

He pulled her to him so they were standing with her back to his front and his arms around her. ""I think you're an amazing wife honey."" He kissed her on top of the head.

""Aww, thank you Master."" She beamed and craned her neck around to kiss him, then spoke again once the kiss broke. ""But I meant about the mine and mining town.""

""It looks like..."" He turned to see his other wives and Selene had come up behind him. It was somewhat amusing to see all their hair looking about the same in the rain. Even Beth's hair looked dark when completely soaked.

""It looks like most of Ivernia; poor, but well-cared for with limited resources."" He finished. ""It makes me wonder just how bad the Ivernian Reeves are.""

""Reeves, those are the tax collectors?"" Selene asked.

""Yes."" Beth replied. ""They have a reputation for skimming taxes and taking more than they should, but I don't think anywhere has it as bad as Ivernia.""

""So maybe I need to pay this town's Reeve a visit too."" Ethan mused.

""I would've loved to see the previous Reeve visit sir."" Alana grinned.

""Master was amazing."" Taloni sighed from his arms.",,2025-08-15T19:12:10.784059,3540,

--

To say I rushed out after work would be an understatement. I practically sprinted out of the building and grabbed the first cab that vaguely looked at me. A generous tip and a hair raising ride through rush hour later I was standing at the door to the girl's room, grinning ear to ear. I knocked on the door and a soft, ""Come in,"" came from the room.

I opened the door and saw Starla and Sherry sitting at the kitchen counter, deep in discussion. Sherry looked up at me and her beautiful smile spread across her face.

""Hello, Master,"" she said to me in a sultry tone.

""Slut,"" Starla said but without any venom. Sherry simply stuck her tongue out at her roommate before returning her attention to me.

""Hideo said you had a little talk with him today. He tried to lay down the law to me. It was so cute.""

""Well I know you have certain needs,"" I said as I tried to subtly look into the bedroom for Louise.

""Master, I will fuck whoever you tell me to. But what I need is a big thick white cock and a dominant white owner,"" she was watching me, no smile, no emotion. Simply trying to judge my reaction.

I stopped looking around and focused on the short, Asian sexpot in front of me. ""Don't worry, Sherry. I am never going to give you away. I've been clear from the moment this started that if Hideo was able to TAKE you away, I wouldn't stop it. But if he's not..."" I paused meaningfully before walking up to her. I could see her breath quicken and her chest heave. The anticipation of what I was going to do or say, ""Then Carly won't be the only pregnant chink carrying a superior white baby.""

Her eyes fluttered and she moaned softly, ""Thank you, Master.""

""Now... I want you to do me a favor tonight. To show me how truly submissive you are to me and not Hideo.""

""Yes, Master?""

""Go over to his place and make him eat you to as many orgasms as you can take.""

""But... but... I'll be all bitchy like you hate?"" she said, confused.

""Exactly... take him out to dinner and show him how you are after you've been sated. Explain it all to him. Tell him everything. Tell him how being denied by my big white cock makes you feel. Tell him how he's only good for giving you orgasms so you can go back to being denied by a real man.""

Sherry's eyes were wide and she nodded in understanding. ""Yes, Master."" She hopped off her chair and ran into the bedroom.

""You really have all of them wrapped around your finger, don't you?"" Starla said.

I looked at the busty girl. The girl that had begged Kyrsten to get me to force myself on her. In many ways, Starla was my kinkiest slut... though maybe Maureen was close... or Sherry... or... okay... well, they were all pretty kinky. ""I think it would be more accurate to say I have all of you wrapped around my cock.""

She ""harumphed"" but didn't say anything, simply folded her arms across her chest and looked at me.

""Be honest, for once, Starla. You're wet right now thinking of being fucked and Sherry finding out your perverted little fetish, aren't you?""

Her mouth hung open and she tried to shake her head side to side, ""No,"" she whispered defensively. ""I... I... I don't want that...""

""Then what do you want, Starla? Do you want to be my girlfriend? Is that what you imagine? Do you want to be girl number 4 in my life?""

She thought about it for a moment before looking at me, ""Actually... no... I like you and all. But you're not really my type.""

I was a little taken aback, ""Not your type? Seriously?""

""I kind of like the quiet nerdy types,"" she said with a wistful smile.

The irony of that statement wasn't lost on me. In high school, that would have described me pretty well. I'd done a lot over the years to grow beyond that aspect of myself and the situation with Carly and all the other women had really brought me to another level of confidence. But eight years ago I would have been exactly what she described. Of course, eight years ago I wouldn't have had the confidence to take her and make her mine even through her mock protests. And that gave me the realization about why she was so frustrated, ""You're looking for a unicorn, aren't you Starla?""

""What do you mean?""

""You want a quiet, nerdy, introspective kind of guy. But you also want a guy who will take you and claim you and use you."" I was trying to be matter of fact. I didn't want to fuck her right then. Half of my mind was still on Louise, after all.

""No... well... yeah... I guess. That's pretty much it.""

""Tell you what, until you find your unicorn, you have fun dating all the guys you want and I'll just keep taking anything and everything I want from you whenever I feel like it."" I smiled at her, trying for all the world to look cocky.

She looked at me and the smoldering look was back. She leaned forward, letting her t-shirt fall open and revealing her beautiful, naked breasts. ""I think that would be a terrible idea. All those poor boys would be positively green with envy,"" she said, emphasizing our safeword, green.

""I'm sure,"" I said. I reached forward and grabbed her hard nipples through the t-shirt, twisting them roughly and leaving the shirt stretched out. Starla yelped but I kept doing it, pinching harder and twisting further until I heard the bedroom door open. I quickly released her nipples and she sat back down, practically panting. Sherry barely noticed either of us, however. She was applying her makeup and talking to Hideo on the phone, telling him that she'd be over in just a few minutes.

I said my goodbyes to the girls and walked out, still unaware where Louise was. I pulled out my phone and typed a quick message.

Me: Hey! Where are you?

Louise: Carly took me shopping and is going to help me get ready. I'm at your place.

Me:??

Louise: Come on over, stud ;)

I started to run downstairs but was suddenly stopped by a beautiful woman who was watching me with all the intensity of one of my girls and none of the lust. ""Sorry, I'm in a hurry... I need...""

""Yeah... I know all about it. Off to another girl?""

I was a little taken aback. ""Yes... I'm sorry... who are you?"" I looked her up and down, it was the same Arabic girl I'd noticed a couple of times before. Her light caramel skin was smooth and her face was absolutely stunning. Any other day and I'd have been very interested in pursuing her. Just not today.

""I'm the RA for this floor.""

""Oh... hi. I'm Jay. It's nice to meet you,"" I said extending my hand. She simply looked at it and shrugged.

""I'm not here to introduce myself. Look, I've been watching you...""

""Really?"" I said, intrigued despite my rush.

""Not like that, dick. I've seen what's been going on with Sherry. You need to cool it.""

""We aren't hurting anybody,"" I said defensively.

""Not right now... maybe. I'll be talking to Sherry and she may need to see a school psychologist.""

""What? Why?""

""She walked naked through the dorm after getting a whole bunch of fucked up tattoos.""

I sighed. When she put it like that it didn't sound so good. ""Look... it's complicated and personal.""

""Personal but between you, her and a bunch of other girls?""

""Yes. Exactly. Look, I'm really in a rush, Sherry's headed out tonight but I'm sure she'll talk to you. In fact, I'll text her and tell her it's okay. But don't jump to conclusions, please. Keep an open mind and actually listen to her. Okay?""

""I don't owe you shit, asshole?"" she said.

""I know. But you do owe Sherry at least the benefit of the doubt. And for my part, we'll keep the wild stuff behind closed door, okay?""

""Fine. But we're not done here, okay?""

""I'll be around. Now, can I please go. I really am in a hurry.""

She waved me on and I finished my rush downstairs and back to my apartment. 15 minute later I was opening the door, having fumbled and dropped the keys twice in my rush.

""Carly? Louise?"" I called opening the door.

""Master, what took you so long?"" Carly said, coming up to me and giving me a sweet welcome home kiss. She was wearing a short, thin t-shirt that barely covered her body.

I laughed and hugged her, ""I got a little excited by Louise's text and went straight to her dorm after work.""

""Pretty eager, aren't you Master?""

""I guess I am... uhmm... is she here?""

""Yes. She wanted my help in getting ready for tonight,"" Carly said. Something about the way she said it made it sound much less casual than that.

""What do you mean?""

Suddenly, Louise walked out completely nude. I'd seen little bits of her in her teasing over the last month but this was the first time seeing her completely and totally naked. Her dark, chestnut hair hung across her shoulders, covering one of her small breasts but leaving the other completely exposed. I could see the rock hard nipple poking out, practically begging for attention. Her body was shiny, as if she'd just gotten out of the shower and her legs and pussy were perfectly smooth. ""Carly has already shaved me and rubbed some nice lotion onto my skin so it's as soft and smooth as possible for you, Mr. S.""

I swallowed hard as I stared at her and Carly gave me a peck on the cheek before whispering, ""I love you. You're welcome."" She walked over to Louise and said, ""Now we just need to find you the perfect outfit for him.""

""Yes,"" Louise said as she turned away and headed for the bedroom. ""Find me something that will make him more turned on than he's ever been before, will you? Something appropriate for his new white goddess.""

""Of course,"" Carly said simply. She looked over her shoulder and her eyes sparkled with mischievous lust. I almost felt like I was along for the ride as I followed the perfect naked ass into my room. I dimly made a note of the cute little dimples in the small of her back and the nice tiny waist that would be perfect for holding onto. But those were simply background thoughts as I marveled at how effortlessly she'd slipped into the kink that Carly and I shared.

Louise stood in front of the full length mirror in our room, looking at herself. ""She did a very good job getting me smooth, didn't she Mr. S?""

""Very good,"" I said, somehow finding my voice.

""But now she needs to make me look perfect. Show our Master what you bought me today, Carly.""

Carly happily walked over and picked up two bags and then carefully laying out the various articles of clothing on the bed. It was a lot.

""I know Master wants you to wear stockings and a choker. I think these will be perfect,"" she said as she held up a leather collar and some fishnet stockings.

I felt my cock twitch but Louise had other ideas, ""No... Those will be good for another night. A night only about fucking. But not tonight, I don't think. I'm a virgin, after all, you know. Not some pathetic trashy whore... at least not yet,"" she said winking at me. ""I think those would look better on you. You can wear them while you edge yourself and wait for him.""

Carly nodded, ""Then I think these might be best,"" she said, this time holding up a pair of white silk stockings that looked particularly expensive. They were accompanied by a lace garter belt.

Louise nodded and Carly rushed to fit it around Louise's slim waist. Then she held the stockings so that Louise could step into them as she rolled them up and clipped them in place. It was a very erotic, almost ritualistic set of actions and I wondered if they'd rehearsed this. While she was stepping into the stockings, she reached down and held up two other chokers. One was a soft, fragile looking white lace choker while the other was a black velvet ribbon with a small pearl dangling down. ""Which do you like, Mr. S?""

""I think the white one would be best for you... at least tonight.""

""Mmmm... you want to be reminded how virginal and innocent I am?""

""Something like that,"" I said with a smile. She tossed the other on the bed and slipped the chosen necklace on, watching me as she did it.

""Now... Carly offered to buy me some underwear but I didn't think that would be appropriate. So the only thing left is to choose a dress. Carly, show Mr. S the two dresses you bought me. I picked one of them and she picked the other. Don't tell him which..."" she said in warning as Carly grabbed two articles of clothing from the bed. ""If he picks mine, you don't get his cock for a week. If he picks yours, you get to drink his cum from me tonight,"" she said and Carly nodded.

""Don't I get a say in this?"" I asked with a smile.

""Of course, Mr. S. You get whatever you want. Those are just suggestions,"" Louise said with all the mock sincerity she could muster. She grinned at me and winked bawdily.

I looked at the two dresses. One was a long, light blue dress with slits halfway up the thigh on either side and a sleeveless halter top with a large cutout that would amply show off my date's cleavage.

The other was a short red mini-dress, barely long enough to cover the stocking tops. There was a slit up one side that went all the way to the hip. It also had a loose, plunging top that would drop to the woman's belly button. I knew which one each of the girls had chosen. I knew that the more reserved, elegant one was the one that Louise had chosen. I knew that Carly would have chosen the other one. Heck, she had a dress very similar to it that she knew was my favorite.

""Louise,"" I said to the short, nearly naked woman. ""I think that the white, innocent stockings will contrast very nicely with a particularly sexy dress. So I think the red one is what I'd like.""

Louise looked a little surprised but then smiled. Carly practically jumped for joy, clapping her hands girlishly. ""I hope you're just as happy when you're licking his cum from my freshly fucked cunt.""

Carly gave me a huge kiss and then stared into my eyes when she said, ""I'm happy to take Master's cum from any source. Any hole. Whatever he wants.""

I kissed her back, our tongue's dancing together briefly before I disentangled. ""Carly, you need to help my date with her shoes too,"" I said.

""Yes, Master,"" she whispered as she knelt down at Louise's feet.

""The black strappy ones,"" I said before either woman could ask. Truthfully, all three pairs of shoes the girls picked out were incredibly sexy. I was tempted to have Louise wear the thigh high boots that they'd found but they weren't super practical and it was a pretty warm night. The pair I chose were four or five inches high and I was sure they would look very sexy on her.

Louise watched me as she stepped into each shoe, allowing Carly to guide her foot sensually into place. Again there was that almost ritualistic pattern. Carly slowly slid Louise's foot into the shoe then snugly secured it with the thin straps before buckling the delicate latch into place and then repeating with the other foot. When the shoe was secured, Louise abruptly stepped forward and gave me a massive kiss, ignoring Carly.

""Now... I'm going to take your fiance out on a wonderful date, tease him until he's rock hard then come back here and fuck him right in front of you, slut. By the end of the night, he'll know which type of pussy he likes best."" Louise said the words to Carly in a matter of fact way but that didn't stop Carly from being obviously aroused. ""And what are you going to do while you wait for us?""

""I'm going to dress like a cheap, chink bitch and edge myself until I can't think anymore."" Carly's smile was so broad you almost wouldn't believe the words coming from her mouth.

""Good girl,"" I said to Carly before giving her a little peck on her forehead and a pat on the ass. I grabbed Louise's hand and led her out, leaving Carly behind to do exactly as she promised. I had no doubt that we'd return home to find her a deliriously happy puddle of goo waiting for the final show.

--

Louise and I made out in the elevator... and the cab... and the waiting area at the restaurant. We got a lot of looks but neither one of us particularly cared. When we were finally seated, it was almost disappointing to have to keep ourselves at bay for the next half an hour.

As we waited for our appetizers, we made small talk, trying to pass the time.

""Okay... here's something I've got to know. How many people am I sleeping with?"" she asked me all of a sudden. The question took me aback.

""Uhmm... none?""

""No... I mean... like they say that you're sleeping with all the people your SO is sleeping with... so if I jump into bed with you...""

""If?"" I asked playfully, running my finger across her hand and eliciting a lovely giggle.

""Okay... when I sleep with you, stud... when,"" she said with some emphasis, ""How many people?""

""Uhmm... Let's see... Carly and Sherry you already know about. Ditto Maureen that I haven't technically slept with...""

""Oh you will... she was fucking hot,"" Louise said with a smile.

""Probably,"" I said trying to play it cool, ""But there's also Kyrsten and Rebeccah back in Orlando. And Alex and Natalie in Boston.""

""Who are Alex and Natalie?""

""Carly's old roommates,"" I told her, ""Kyrsten you met when she came to visit. The girl with the curly red hair,"" I said making vague gestures with my hand.

""Oh I remember. The girl with the sick curves. I was a little intimidated that day.""

""Why?""

""Well, you were already fucking Sherry. And Starla has big ol titties too... and then you trot in this redheaded, booblicious sexpot. I mean... I started to wonder.""

""I'm sorry,"" I told her, not realizing that she might have thought I had a 'type'.

""It was fine. I asked Sherry and she showed me a picture of Carly... that encouraged me a lot,"" she said with a laugh. Carly's not small chested by any means. A solid B Cup and slightly bigger than Louise. But I could see how it dissuaded her that I was some kind of tittie chaser. ""Who's Rebeccah?""

""Uhmm.. well... the girl I went down to Orlando to try to hookup with, Jennifer?"" I said. She nodded, remembering the story. ""Her little sister was friends with Sherry in school and she and I hooked up.""

""Damn stud... nailing all your high school friends' sisters, huh?""

""Just the two so far,"" I said with a smile.

""Okay, so that's what,"" she looked at her fingers that she'd been tracking with, ""seven, right?""

I nodded, ""Victoria and Daphne at work... oh... and Dave's wife Madison.""

""Ten... Double digits in a couple months. Pretty impressive, Mr. S,"" she said as she cheekily bit her tongue between her teeth and smiled.

""I had a one night fling with Jackie... Carly's college... uhmm... girlfriend sort of?""

""Girlfriend 'sort of'?... there's a story there but I'll get her to tell me, I guess,"" Louise said, letting me off the hook for that one. ""Is that all?

""Uh.. well... I'm not THAT far removed from Sasha, my ex. But I got tested after that given how it ended and I'm not sleeping with her again. Oh... and I kind of slept with Mrs. Young,"" I said slightly sheepishly.

""No shit... really? Do they know?""

""Carly was there. She kind of encouraged it.""

""Wow!"" Louise said, lost for words for once.

""But Sherry doesn't know so don't tell her.""

""I can keep a secret... okay... so that's twelve, right?""

""One more... but I don't think I can tell you about her.""

""Wait... why not? Why all the secrecy now? You just told me you slept with your fiance's mother for crying out loud"" She looked at me, watching my face for a reaction. I knew I was toast. I realized my mistake too late and she'd figure it out any second. There was no reason to keep anyone secret except...

""Starla? No way. When?""

=== PAGE BREAK ===

I stopped looking around and focused on the short, Asian sexpot in front of me. ""Don't worry, Sherry. I am never going to give you away. I've been clear from the moment this started that if Hideo was able to TAKE you away, I wouldn't stop it. But if he's not..."" I paused meaningfully before walking up to her. I could see her breath quicken and her chest heave. The anticipation of what I was going to do or say, ""Then Carly won't be the only pregnant chink carrying a superior white baby.""

Her eyes fluttered and she moaned softly, ""Thank you, Master.""

""Now... I want you to do me a favor tonight. To show me how truly submissive you are to me and not Hideo.""

""Yes, Master?""

""Go over to his place and make him eat you to as many orgasms as you can take.""

""But... but... I'll be all bitchy like you hate?"" she said, confused.

""Exactly... take him out to dinner and show him how you are after you've been sated. Explain it all to him. Tell him everything. Tell him how being denied by my big white cock makes you feel. Tell him how he's only good for giving you orgasms so you can go back to being denied by a real man.""

Sherry's eyes were wide and she nodded in understanding. ""Yes, Master."" She hopped off her chair and ran into the bedroom.

""You really have all of them wrapped around your finger, don't you?"" Starla said.

I looked at the busty girl. The girl that had begged Kyrsten to get me to force myself on her. In many ways, Starla was my kinkiest slut... though maybe Maureen was close... or Sherry... or... okay... well, they were all pretty kinky. ""I think it would be more accurate to say I have all of you wrapped around my cock.""

She ""harumphed"" but didn't say anything, simply folded her arms across her chest and looked at me.

""Be honest, for once, Starla. You're wet right now thinking of being fucked and Sherry finding out your perverted little fetish, aren't you?""

Her mouth hung open and she tried to shake her head side to side, ""No,"" she whispered defensively. ""I... I... I don't want that...""

""Then what do you want, Starla? Do you want to be my girlfriend? Is that what you imagine? Do you want to be girl number 4 in my life?""

She thought about it for a moment before looking at me, ""Actually... no... I like you and all. But you're not really my type.""

I was a little taken aback, ""Not your type? Seriously?""

""I kind of like the quiet nerdy types,"" she said with a wistful smile.

The irony of that statement wasn't lost on me. In high school, that would have described me pretty well. I'd done a lot over the years to grow beyond that aspect of myself and the situation with Carly and all the other women had really brought me to another level of confidence. But eight years ago I would have been exactly what she described. Of course, eight years ago I wouldn't have had the confidence to take her and make her mine even through her mock protests. And that gave me the realization about why she was so frustrated, ""You're looking for a unicorn, aren't you Starla?""

""What do you mean?""

""You want a quiet, nerdy, introspective kind of guy. But you also want a guy who will take you and claim you and use you."" I was trying to be matter of fact. I didn't want to fuck her right then. Half of my mind was still on Louise, after all.

""No... well... yeah... I guess. That's pretty much it.""

""Tell you what, until you find your unicorn, you have fun dating all the guys you want and I'll just keep taking anything and everything I want from you whenever I feel like it."" I smiled at her, trying for all the world to look cocky.

She looked at me and the smoldering look was back. She leaned forward, letting her t-shirt fall open and revealing her beautiful, naked breasts. ""I think that would be a terrible idea. All those poor boys would be positively green with envy,"" she said, emphasizing our safeword, green.

""I'm sure,"" I said. I reached forward and grabbed her hard nipples through the t-shirt, twisting them roughly and leaving the shirt stretched out. Starla yelped but I kept doing it, pinching harder and twisting further until I heard the bedroom door open. I quickly released her nipples and she sat back down, practically panting. Sherry barely noticed either of us, however. She was applying her makeup and talking to Hideo on the phone, telling him that she'd be over in just a few minutes.

I said my goodbyes to the girls and walked out, still unaware where Louise was. I pulled out my phone and typed a quick message.

Me: Hey! Where are you?

Louise: Carly took me shopping and is going to help me get ready. I'm at your place.

Me:??

Louise: Come on over, stud ;)

I started to run downstairs but was suddenly stopped by a beautiful woman who was watching me with all the intensity of one of my girls and none of the lust. ""Sorry, I'm in a hurry... I need...""

""Yeah... I know all about it. Off to another girl?""

I was a little taken aback. ""Yes... I'm sorry... who are you?"" I looked her up and down, it was the same Arabic girl I'd noticed a couple of times before. Her light caramel skin was smooth and her face was absolutely stunning. Any other day and I'd have been very interested in pursuing her. Just not today.

""I'm the RA for this floor.""

""Oh... hi. I'm Jay. It's nice to meet you,"" I said extending my hand. She simply looked at it and shrugged.

""I'm not here to introduce myself. Look, I've been watching you...""

""Really?"" I said, intrigued despite my rush.

""Not like that, dick. I've seen what's been going on with Sherry. You need to cool it.""

""We aren't hurting anybody,"" I said defensively.

""Not right now... maybe. I'll be talking to Sherry and she may need to see a school psychologist.""

""What? Why?""

""She walked naked through the dorm after getting a whole bunch of fucked up tattoos.""

I sighed. When she put it like that it didn't sound so good. ""Look... it's complicated and personal.""

""Personal but between you, her and a bunch of other girls?""

""Yes. Exactly. Look, I'm really in a rush, Sherry's headed out tonight but I'm sure she'll talk to you. In fact, I'll text her and tell her it's okay. But don't jump to conclusions, please. Keep an open mind and actually listen to her. Okay?""

""I don't owe you shit, asshole?"" she said.

""I know. But you do owe Sherry at least the benefit of the doubt. And for my part, we'll keep the wild stuff behind closed door, okay?""

""Fine. But we're not done here, okay?""

""I'll be around. Now, can I please go. I really am in a hurry.""

She waved me on and I finished my rush downstairs and back to my apartment. 15 minute later I was opening the door, having fumbled and dropped the keys twice in my rush.

""Carly? Louise?"" I called opening the door.

""Master, what took you so long?"" Carly said, coming up to me and giving me a sweet welcome home kiss. She was wearing a short, thin t-shirt that barely covered her body.

I laughed and hugged her, ""I got a little excited by Louise's text and went straight to her dorm after work.""

""Pretty eager, aren't you Master?""

""I guess I am... uhmm... is she here?""

""Yes. She wanted my help in getting ready for tonight,"" Carly said. Something about the way she said it made it sound much less casual than that.

""What do you mean?""

Suddenly, Louise walked out completely nude. I'd seen little bits of her in her teasing over the last month but this was the first time seeing her completely and totally naked. Her dark, chestnut hair hung across her shoulders, covering one of her small breasts but leaving the other completely exposed. I could see the rock hard nipple poking out, practically begging for attention. Her body was shiny, as if she'd just gotten out of the shower and her legs and pussy were perfectly smooth. ""Carly has already shaved me and rubbed some nice lotion onto my skin so it's as soft and smooth as possible for you, Mr. S.""

I swallowed hard as I stared at her and Carly gave me a peck on the cheek before whispering, ""I love you. You're welcome."" She walked over to Louise and said, ""Now we just need to find you the perfect outfit for him.""

""Yes,"" Louise said as she turned away and headed for the bedroom. ""Find me something that will make him more turned on than he's ever been before, will you? Something appropriate for his new white goddess.""

""Of course,"" Carly said simply. She looked over her shoulder and her eyes sparkled with mischievous lust. I almost felt like I was along for the ride as I followed the perfect naked ass into my room. I dimly made a note of the cute little dimples in the small of her back and the nice tiny waist that would be perfect for holding onto. But those were simply background thoughts as I marveled at how effortlessly she'd slipped into the kink that Carly and I shared.

Louise stood in front of the full length mirror in our room, looking at herself. ""She did a very good job getting me smooth, didn't she Mr. S?""

""Very good,"" I said, somehow finding my voice.

""But now she needs to make me look perfect. Show our Master what you bought me today, Carly.""

Carly happily walked over and picked up two bags and then carefully laying out the various articles of clothing on the bed. It was a lot.

""I know Master wants you to wear stockings and a choker. I think these will be perfect,"" she said as she held up a leather collar and some fishnet stockings.

I felt my cock twitch but Louise had other ideas, ""No... Those will be good for another night. A night only about fucking. But not tonight, I don't think. I'm a virgin, after all, you know. Not some pathetic trashy whore... at least not yet,"" she said winking at me. ""I think those would look better on you. You can wear them while you edge yourself and wait for him.""

Carly nodded, ""Then I think these might be best,"" she said, this time holding up a pair of white silk stockings that looked particularly expensive. They were accompanied by a lace garter belt.

Louise nodded and Carly rushed to fit it around Louise's slim waist. Then she held the stockings so that Louise could step into them as she rolled them up and clipped them in place. It was a very erotic, almost ritualistic set of actions and I wondered if they'd rehearsed this. While she was stepping into the stockings, she reached down and held up two other chokers. One was a soft, fragile looking white lace choker while the other was a black velvet ribbon with a small pearl dangling down. ""Which do you like, Mr. S?""

""I think the white one would be best for you... at least tonight.""

""Mmmm... you want to be reminded how virginal and innocent I am?""

""Something like that,"" I said with a smile. She tossed the other on the bed and slipped the chosen necklace on, watching me as she did it.

""Now... Carly offered to buy me some underwear but I didn't think that would be appropriate. So the only thing left is to choose a dress. Carly, show Mr. S the two dresses you bought me. I picked one of them and she picked the other. Don't tell him which..."" she said in warning as Carly grabbed two articles of clothing from the bed. ""If he picks mine, you don't get his cock for a week. If he picks yours, you get to drink his cum from me tonight,"" she said and Carly nodded.

""Don't I get a say in this?"" I asked with a smile.

""Of course, Mr. S. You get whatever you want. Those are just suggestions,"" Louise said with all the mock sincerity she could muster. She grinned at me and winked bawdily.

I looked at the two dresses. One was a long, light blue dress with slits halfway up the thigh on either side and a sleeveless halter top with a large cutout that would amply show off my date's cleavage.

The other was a short red mini-dress, barely long enough to cover the stocking tops. There was a slit up one side that went all the way to the hip. It also had a loose, plunging top that would drop to the woman's belly button. I knew which one each of the girls had chosen. I knew that the more reserved, elegant one was the one that Louise had chosen. I knew that Carly would have chosen the other one. Heck, she had a dress very similar to it that she knew was my favorite.

""Louise,"" I said to the short, nearly naked woman. ""I think that the white, innocent stockings will contrast very nicely with a particularly sexy dress. So I think the red one is what I'd like.""

Louise looked a little surprised but then smiled. Carly practically jumped for joy, clapping her hands girlishly. ""I hope you're just as happy when you're licking his cum from my freshly fucked cunt.""

Carly gave me a huge kiss and then stared into my eyes when she said, ""I'm happy to take Master's cum from any source. Any hole. Whatever he wants.""

I kissed her back, our tongue's dancing together briefly before I disentangled. ""Carly, you need to help my date with her shoes too,"" I said.

""Yes, Master,"" she whispered as she knelt down at Louise's feet.

""The black strappy ones,"" I said before either woman could ask. Truthfully, all three pairs of shoes the girls picked out were incredibly sexy. I was tempted to have Louise wear the thigh high boots that they'd found but they weren't super practical and it was a pretty warm night. The pair I chose were four or five inches high and I was sure they would look very sexy on her.

Louise watched me as she stepped into each shoe, allowing Carly to guide her foot sensually into place. Again there was that almost ritualistic pattern. Carly slowly slid Louise's foot into the shoe then snugly secured it with the thin straps before buckling the delicate latch into place and then repeating with the other foot. When the shoe was secured, Louise abruptly stepped forward and gave me a massive kiss, ignoring Carly.

""Now... I'm going to take your fiance out on a wonderful date, tease him until he's rock hard then come back here and fuck him right in front of you, slut. By the end of the night, he'll know which type of pussy he likes best."" Louise said the words to Carly in a matter of fact way but that didn't stop Carly from being obviously aroused. ""And what are you going to do while you wait for us?""

""I'm going to dress like a cheap, chink bitch and edge myself until I can't think anymore."" Carly's smile was so broad you almost wouldn't believe the words coming from her mouth.

""Good girl,"" I said to Carly before giving her a little peck on her forehead and a pat on the ass. I grabbed Louise's hand and led her out, leaving Carly behind to do exactly as she promised. I had no doubt that we'd return home to find her a deliriously happy puddle of goo waiting for the final show.

--

Louise and I made out in the elevator... and the cab... and the waiting area at the restaurant. We got a lot of looks but neither one of us particularly cared. When we were finally seated, it was almost disappointing to have to keep ourselves at bay for the next half an hour.

As we waited for our appetizers, we made small talk, trying to pass the time.

""Okay... here's something I've got to know. How many people am I sleeping with?"" she asked me all of a sudden. The question took me aback.

""Uhmm... none?""

""No... I mean... like they say that you're sleeping with all the people your SO is sleeping with... so if I jump into bed with you...""

""If?"" I asked playfully, running my finger across her hand and eliciting a lovely giggle.

""Okay... when I sleep with you, stud... when,"" she said with some emphasis, ""How many people?""

""Uhmm... Let's see... Carly and Sherry you already know about. Ditto Maureen that I haven't technically slept with...""

""Oh you will... she was fucking hot,"" Louise said with a smile.

""Probably,"" I said trying to play it cool, ""But there's also Kyrsten and Rebeccah back in Orlando. And Alex and Natalie in Boston.""

""Who are Alex and Natalie?""

""Carly's old roommates,"" I told her, ""Kyrsten you met when she came to visit. The girl with the curly red hair,"" I said making vague gestures with my hand.

""Oh I remember. The girl with the sick curves. I was a little intimidated that day.""

""Why?""

""Well, you were already fucking Sherry. And Starla has big ol titties too... and then you trot in this redheaded, booblicious sexpot. I mean... I started to wonder.""

""I'm sorry,"" I told her, not realizing that she might have thought I had a 'type'.

""It was fine. I asked Sherry and she showed me a picture of Carly... that encouraged me a lot,"" she said with a laugh. Carly's not small chested by any means. A solid B Cup and slightly bigger than Louise. But I could see how it dissuaded her that I was some kind of tittie chaser. ""Who's Rebeccah?""

""Uhmm.. well... the girl I went down to Orlando to try to hookup with, Jennifer?"" I said. She nodded, remembering the story. ""Her little sister was friends with Sherry in school and she and I hooked up.""

""Damn stud... nailing all your high school friends' sisters, huh?""

""Just the two so far,"" I said with a smile.

""Okay, so that's what,"" she looked at her fingers that she'd been tracking with, ""seven, right?""

I nodded, ""Victoria and Daphne at work... oh... and Dave's wife Madison.""

""Ten... Double digits in a couple months. Pretty impressive, Mr. S,"" she said as she cheekily bit her tongue between her teeth and smiled.

""I had a one night fling with Jackie... Carly's college... uhmm... girlfriend sort of?""

""Girlfriend 'sort of'?... there's a story there but I'll get her to tell me, I guess,"" Louise said, letting me off the hook for that one. ""Is that all?

""Uh.. well... I'm not THAT far removed from Sasha, my ex. But I got tested after that given how it ended and I'm not sleeping with her again. Oh... and I kind of slept with Mrs. Young,"" I said slightly sheepishly.

""No shit... really? Do they know?""

""Carly was there. She kind of encouraged it.""

""Wow!"" Louise said, lost for words for once.

""But Sherry doesn't know so don't tell her.""

""I can keep a secret... okay... so that's twelve, right?""

""One more... but I don't think I can tell you about her.""

""Wait... why not? Why all the secrecy now? You just told me you slept with your fiance's mother for crying out loud"" She looked at me, watching my face for a reaction. I knew I was toast. I realized my mistake too late and she'd figure it out any second. There was no reason to keep anyone secret except...

""Starla? No way. When?""

=== PAGE BREAK ===

""Shhh...,"" I said. It was kind of ridiculous but I was really uncomfortable talking so openly about it. I lowered my voice and Louise leaned in, ""the week Kyrsten was here.""

""Wait... really? So like your first date she put out? That doesn't sound like her.""

""Starla is... well, she's special. She has some pretty particular kinks.""

""Like what?""

""I'm not going to tell you that,"" I said flatly.

""Does Kyrsten know?""

""Yeah, she kind of convinced me it was okay.""

""Does Carly know?""

""Uhmm, yeah. I talked to her about it afterwards.""

Louise looked at me and considered me silently. I thought I knew what she was thinking. If I'd told my other two girlfriends and wasn't telling her, what did that mean about how I felt about her. ""You have to realize, Carly is the love of my life and I don't keep secrets from her. Ever. And Kyrsten was there when it happened and I've known her for forever. I trust her completely.""

""No... I get it. I'm not worried about that, Jay,"" she said, surprising me.

""You're not?""

""No... I'm just trying to figure out what it is that she's into. I mean, I thought our histories were kind of tied up together but apparently... ooh, I know. She likes to be peed on?""

""What? Eww... no. Not that,"" I said and we both laughed, ""And stop guessing because I'm going to stop answering.""

""Fine, but one of you is going to tell me eventually,"" she said, stabbing a fork into her salad. ""So somewhere between 12 and 14 girls depending on how you count. And like sixish steady, ongoing ones, right?""

""Yeah,"" I said, eating a breadstick.

""That's a lot of women to compete with Mr. S,"" she said. She licked her tongue around the small tomato on the end of her fork before popping it in her mouth seductively. The way her soft, pink lips wrapped around the red vegetable left my mind momentarily blank.

""Uhmm... I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.""

""Seriously? Don't you understand women at all?""

""What? Why?""

""All those girls have wayyyy more experience than me, right?""

I thought for a second, ""Well... yeah.""

""And I know that blowjob I gave you the other night wasn't the best you've ever had... don't lie to me,"" she said. She wasn't mad, just adamant.

""Look, Louise. Everyone worries about this their first time with someone. And it cuts both ways, right. I had to worry about how I compared to every guy they'd been with. But I know that sex with you is going to be absolutely amazing. Because you're sexy, open to try things and comfortable with your body. You're also obviously kinky as all fuck,"" I said winking at her. She blushed and ate some more of her salad before turning her gaze back to me. ""Trust me... Do what turns you on and tell me what feels good and everything will be fine.""

""What turns me on is the idea of riding you for hours while your fiance watches without cumming.""

I felt my cock, already hard from all the teasing, get even harder. ""I'm sure Carly would like that.""

""As for what feels good... I guess we'll have to try everything so that I can tell you.""

I smiled and leaned forward, giving her a kiss, ""And that's why I know you're going to be dynamite in bed.""

""Damn straight,"" she said. ""OOhh... I know. I bet she likes for a girl to use a strap on on her?""

I laughed, ""Stop guessing."" Louise gently 'humphed' at my admonition but didn't bring it up again. The dinner continued, both of us ordering relatively light food because neither of us wanted to leave dinner feeling stuffed full.

After paying the bill, we practically tumbled into the backseat of the cab, hands exploring each other as we kissed and laughed. I slipped my hand up her thigh and, at first, she pushed me away. I leaned back, surprised and she giggled, ""Sorry... reflex,"" before spreading her legs and pulling my hand back.

I slid my fingers into her, feeling the tight, hot, wet hole that I hoped to be filling up later. Louise moaned, unashamed that the cabbie was watching her wanton exhibition. ""Oh my God Mr. S. That feels so good. Your fingers feel so good in me.""

""Better than Starla's fingers?"" I asked, teasing her as I plunged them in again and circled her clit.

""Oh... yesssss... Starla didn't use her fingers much. More of a tongue kind of girl,"" she said as her hips slammed upward into my hand.

""Hmm. Maybe you and I should get her to use her tongue while I'm fucking you. Would you like that, baby?""

""Yessss... so much yesss,"" she hissed, lewdly humping the air trying to get to my fingers.

I kissed her neck and gently worked up to her ear as my fingers squelched around in her wet core. When I nibbled on her lobe, she shuddered, causing the cabbie to momentarily swerve in distraction, ""Hey... eyes forward, buddy!"" I said with a smile and the man nodded, focusing once again on the ridiculously bad midtown traffic. I whispered into Louise's ear, ""Once you fuck me, you'll never want another cock, Louise.""

She looked at me, eyes searching mine. I had a flashback to Carly doing that so many months ago in that Orlando hotel room. I remembered Kyrsten doing it in my condo. I knew the look. I knew the emotion. It didn't need to be said right now. It just demanded action.

The cabbie pulled up to my building and we laughingly ran inside. The doorman opened the door but we barely acknowledged him as we rushed through the lobby, catching the elevator as it was closing. Once inside, our small amount of inhibition went completely out the window. We were all over each other. I shoved her up against the wall, holding her hands up above her head as our tongues practically fucked each other's mouths. She arched her hips up into me, rubbing herself against my rock hard cock and I responded by shoving her back fully into the wall, pinning her there where she couldn't move. The reaction was electric. She moaned even louder into my mouth, a sound halfway between immeasurable need and boundless lust. When the elevator door opened once again, I practically drug her to my unit. I flung the door open, still kissing Louise as her hands began to find buttons and zippers, working frantically to undress me as rapidly as possible.

""Carly?"" I called out as I looked through the dark condo for my beloved fiance.

""Yes, Master,"" came a slightly weary voice. My eyes adjusted and I realized that she was sitting on the chair, facing the door. Her legs were spread wide and a vibrator on her cunt.

""Come here my beloved,"" I said to her. She stood on shaky legs, clearly weary and drained from the edging she'd been obediently performing. She walked over to me and stood there. Her eyes sparkled as she looked up to me. All that showed in those eyes was obedience and love. I grabbed her and kissed her while Louise wrapped her arms around me from behind, slowly unbuttoning my shirt as she did. ""I'm going to fuck Louise now. She'll be mine. Like you. Like Kyrsten. You understand?""

""Yes, Master.""

""This is your last chance to object,"" I told her as Louise's fingers traced down to my belt.

""I think she's wonderful, Master. I would never object.""

""I may take others, you know. I haven't decided how many to stop at.""

Carly looked at me and there was a silence that seemed to stretch out forever, ""Please. Never stop, Jay,"" she said, her voice soft and nearly cracking.

""Good girl. Now kiss my new lover, Carly,"" I said. She looked over my shoulder and saw the shorter girl standing there nervously. She grabbed Louise's hands and looked at her before pulling the younger girl into her and kissing her sweetly. It wasn't the kiss of love or lust. But a welcoming gesture. An invitation into the weird sisterhood that many of my girls had formed. I watched for a moment, allowing the two women to share with each other before I grabbed Louise and pulled her to me. It was my turn to kiss her again and I picked her up, allowing her legs to wrap around my waist as she did. She laughed and we walked into the bedroom. I was dimly aware of Carly picking up the discarded clothes behind me as I dropped Louise onto the bed with me on top of her. ""Come kneel on the floor, slut. Watch how I fuck my new toy.""

Louise laughed, ""Is that all I am, Mr. S? A toy? A fuck toy,"" she said, emphasizing the word 'fuck' in a way that made my cock twitch.

""You're much more than that, Louise. But right now, the fuck toy is what I want.""

""Mmmm... yessir, Mr. S,"" she said playfully. Her feet scraped along my hips, yanking my underwear down my thighs and exposing my cock. ""Please... Master me,"" she implored with a throaty whisper.

I placed my cock at her entrance, taking a moment to feel the heat and wetness. Her pussy was drenched and ready as I slowly slid into her. Her eyes were closed and I took a moment to look over at Carly who was watching with a huge grin on her face as I added yet another woman to my little harem. I felt only the slightest of resistance as I slid into Louise's willing cunt. Her legs wrapped around me simply pulled and squeezed on me, giving me no choice but to continue forward. Her face winced for just a moment but the look was quickly replaced by one of awe.

""Oh my God, Jay. That is so fucking amazing,"" she said as her eyes snapped open and she looked up at me. ""If I'd known this is what it felt like I wouldn't have waited. I'd have jumped your bones that first night. Fuck me that's good,"" she said. She bucked her hips up against me, kissing me on the lips as she used all of her muscles to urge me on.

""Maybe I should punish you for making me wait,"" I said as I slowly slid out.

""Nooo,"" she wailed before locking her ankles behind me and humping back into me desperately. ""Please no. Fuck me... fuck me... It felt so right inside me,"" she said and I slammed back into her, forcing a scream from her lips. ""Why would you ever share this you dumb slant eyed chink,"" she said to Carly.

""I was bred to serve white cock and Master's god like shaft is the only thing that matters. He wants lots of pussy so he should have lots of pussy. That's all that matters to me,"" Carly said as I slowly fucked Louise.

""Besides, you're going to share, right?"" I asked.

Louise's lips pouted as she looked up at me, ""Only if you make me,"" she said before sticking her tongue out at me.

My only response was to slam into her again, causing her mouth to open in a silent 'O'' of pleasure. ""I'm going to make you. Carly's shown me I'm not a one woman man. I'll fuck anyone I want,"" I said and kissed her.

""Fuck yes... can I watch? Can I help?"" she said with a smile. I simply smiled back and began hammering into her with increased speed and depth. My cock felt like it was made of steel as I slid in and out of her, fucking her harder and harder. ""Fuck yes... I'm gonna love being your slutty little fuck toy... show me... teach me... train me... use me... fuckfuckfuck,"" she said as I hammered into her over and over. I continued to pound her as my hands roamed across her body. I played with her tits as I fucked her over and over, testing to see what she liked. I tweaked her nipples, pinched them, twisted them and flicked them. She liked it all. I grabbed her waist and pounded into her even harder. All I felt was her cunt clench my cock tighter. No matter what I did, she seemed to love it more.

I grabbed her ankles and held her wide apart as I pounded her even harder. When I saw her eyes roll into her head I knew she was beyond thought. Her babbling descended into beautiful incoherence as my cock fucked her harder and harder. Her hands were clenched into little balls as I pummeled her small frame. I took one of her hands and brought it to her clit and she started working herself over with a sigh of relief as I resumed my own fucking. I started hammering her with long hard strokes then fast ones, switching it up and judging her reaction. Eventually, we fell into a rhythm and before I knew it, she shot off. ""I'm cummingggg!"" she screamed as her whole body shook. I kept fucking her through her first orgasm and she had a second, smaller one before it proved to be too much for me. ""Cum for me... fill me up... cum for me, lover,"" she whispered.

I roared as I slammed into her with three long strokes, shooting what felt like a gallon of my seed into her. I leaned down and kissed the smaller girl, looming over her in a way that made me feel very powerful. She looked up at me, eyes wide as she stretched her neck to kiss me with every bit of the same passion she showed before our fucking. I felt Carly move beneath me and felt her tongue stroke the bottom of my softening cock right at the junction of my union with Louise.

I looked down, ""Eager little cunt, aren't you?""

""Yes, Master,"" Carly said with a smile before resuming her ministrations. As I pulled out of Louise, she sighed a small sound of disappointment. But then she gasped and smiled as Carly's eager tongue found Louise's abused hole. She gently licked and sucked all of the cum out of my new girlfriend that she could and Louise loved it. I cuddled with Louise as Carly continued working her over, eventually giving her one last little orgasm before she pushed Carly away from her oversensitive clit.

Carly crawled up to the other side of me and laid her head down next to me. Again, I was reminded of that hotel visit in Orlando. This time remembering the aftermath of all the hot fucking with these two beautiful gorgeous women on either arm. Although that time was Kyrsten instead of Louise.

""I miss Kyrsten,"" I said before immediately regretting it. ""I mean... not that you weren't amazing Louise I was just..."" I fumbled awkwardly.

Louise giggled and gave me a sweet kiss to shut me up. ""It's okay, Mr. S. I know what you mean. I can't wait to get to know her better too.""

""I just wish she could have been here for this is all.""

""I watched the whole thing, Master,"" came Kyrsten's voice inexplicably. For the briefest of moments, I thought I might have been imagining things. Surely going crazy would explain the last two months of my life well, right?

""Kyrsten?"" I asked tentatively.

""On your laptop, Master,"" came Kyrsten's voice again. I glanced around and there, in the corner of the room was my laptop adorned by Kyrsten's beautiful, smiling face. Despite talking to her frequently, we hadn't had time to do much video chatting and it made me realize how much I missed just seeing her. ""Carly set this up so I could watch. She said she thought Louise might be special.""

I felt Louise hug me tightly at that as I wondered what Carly and Kyrsten had discussed. I turned my head and gave Carly a well earned kis. ""This was very thoughtful of you, Carly.""

""Thank you, Master. I know Kyrsten has been missing out on things. I thought this would be a nice thing to do for her. I hope you're not mad?""

""Mad? Of course not,"" I said and kissed her forehead.

She frowned slightly before smirking, ""I was hoping you'd be a LITTLE mad, Master. Maybe just mad enough to punish me?""

I laughed, ""Is that what you want, slut? For me to punish you?""

""If it pleases you, Master,"" she said coquettishly.

""You want me to whip your tits and ass?"" I asked her. She gasped slightly at the thought and spread her legs. ""To tie you up and whip your clit? Pinch your nipples hard?"" I asked as my fingers found her hard nubs. I circled around the big nipples before pinching them and causing her to buck her hips up with wanton eagerness. ""To turn your worthless little titties red and put pretty stripes across your pathetic ass. Is that what my dumb chink fiance breeding bitch wants?""

""P... P... please, Master?""

""No,"" I said and her response was as if I'd slammed my cock into her just with the word. She moaned a loud, forlorn wail as if something awful had happened. But her whole body was shaking. ""Tonight isn't your night, whore. It's Louise's night. So she can whip you until you're red and then you can lick her clit while I fuck her last hole.""

Louise licked my ear and whispered, ""So fucking hot, Mr. S. Do all your girls become well trained fuck toys?""

""Pretty much,"" I said as I continued to tease Carly, playing her body like a musical instrument. ""Hope that's okay with you?""

""Only if you turn me into one too. In bed at least.""

""Absolutely, babe,"" I said and kissed Carly then Louise.

""I'm so jealous,"" Kyrsten's voice came from across the room. The three of us laughed and I looked over to see Kyrsten leaning back in her chair. She was obviously naked and playing with herself. I really wish she'd been there with us.

""Jealous of Carly getting whipped or Louise getting all her holes fucked?"" I asked.

""Yes!"" Kyrsten shouted causing all of us to laugh again.

I moved over to Carly and gently took her wrists, kissing her tenderly as I bound them with a scarf. I worked my lips down her body, circling her nipples and then her cunt, offering her no relief. She was shaking and moaning by the time I got to her feet. I pulled out the spreader bar we kept at the foot of the bed and buckled the cuffs to her ankles. ""OOoohh... you guys are really kinky,"" Louise said from behind me. I turned and looked at her, watching her play with her cunt that was still leaking my cum. She looked so cute standing there, vulnerable and eager. I finished locking Carly in place, legs spread and exposed. She obediently hooked her bound wrists into our headboard, exactly as she was trained. Her breathing was heavy as she watched me take out all of the various implements we'd collected. Carly's eyes watched each item as I placed it on the bed beside her. There were the collection of household items we'd started out with. A belt. The rod from a set of venetian blinds. A wooden ping pong paddle. Then came the items we'd purchased. A riding crop. A flogger. A wicked looking wooden rattan. I laid them each out and gestured for Louise to come closer.

""It's important to start out carefully. We don't want to hurt our toy, right?"" I asked Louise while watching Carly's reaction.

Louise bit her lip and nodded, ""Wh... which one should I use, Mr. S?""

""The belt to start,"" I said as I handed it to her.

Her eyes widened, ""The belt? Really?""

I smiled, glad that she'd listened to my admonition to start carefully. ""The belt will hurt if you use it as a whip. Or if you use the buckle which I never use, by the way."" I looked at Carly who was still just staring at us in awe. ""But if you double it over like this,"" I said as I guided the leather strap in her hands and showed her what I meant, ""Then you can almost hit her as hard as you want.""

Louise smiled and nodded. Then she put her knee up on the bed and positioned herself next to Carly. She ran her fingers along my fiance's exposed breasts, just barely grazing the hard nipples before trailing her fingers down to Carly's cunt. ""I'm going to turn your whole body red, okay?""

Carly nodded and bit her lip, ""P... please,"" she whispered. Louise tested the belt against her hand once or twice, feeling the sensation before glancing up at me. I nodded and she brought the belt down on Carly's thigh. ""Thank you, Mistress,"" Carly said with a sigh.

""Mistress? I think I like that... Is that okay, Mr. S?"" she asked with a smile.

I thought about it, ""Who do you belong to, Carly?""

""Only you, Master... nobody else... I promise.""

""Then you may call Louise Mistress when we're playing.""

""Thank you, Master,"" both girls said simultaneously before giggling again. Louise ended Carly's laughing abruptly with another blow, this time to my fiance's left tit. Then her right one. Then her left one again. The smack of leather on flesh was only slightly louder than Carly's increasing moans. I knew from experience that Louise wasn't coming close to her limit. It truly was hard to do with the belt.

""More please, Mistress. Turn my worthless yellow skin red, please. Hurt me! Make me beg! Make me cry.""

""Wow... she really gets off on this?"" Louise asked.",,2025-08-15T19:12:16.904290,3643,3.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/hot-husband-baby-maker,Hot Husband - Baby Maker,Unknown Author,,,,,"Angela and Steve are just a regular couple. Married 11 years with two kids they are nothing out of the ordinary. For the first 10 years of their marriage, Angela and Steve's love life suffered due to Angela's incredibly low libido. However, Angela discovered that making her husband Steve a hot husband had sent her libido into overdrive! They have subsequently had many hot-husband adventures, and this is the continuation of those adventures. you can find the rest of the series at https://www.literotica.com/series/se/hot-husband-adventures.

Hot Husband- Baby Maker

Angela had received quite a few requests on the hot husband email for her husband to breed other women. This always caused her to get aroused. The thought of Steve making a baby with someone else really got her going and she usually stopped looking at her emails to go find Steve for relief!

Steve knew that after the kids went to bed Angela would look at their Reddit Hot Husband page. The comments people left about their videos would get her motor started. Sometimes she would rewatch one of their encounters, which would really rev her up. Other times she would ask Steve to watch with her and that always led to hot loving. Most of the time however she would go from their page to their hot husband email.

This never ceased to get her excited. Angela knew that it was the power to find other lovers for Steve that excited her. She loved to watch Steve fuck them and was proud of what a great lover he was. He had never left an encounter without completely satisfying the other woman or women. That and the act of reclaiming Steve afterward had cured her low libido and taken their marriage to the next level of awesome.

This whole idea of Steve getting someone else pregnant, although appealing to Angela also had the potential to be problematic. Angela had made rules concerning their hot husband adventures to ensure it didn't go sideways. One was no repeat encounters. The exception to this rule was her sister Sophia but that was a whole other story that will be discussed further later. Obviously getting someone pregnant would require multiple meetings.

Another rule was Angela was always present for their encounters. She either was openly in the room operating the camera and video or she was hidden and watching the action. Again, given work and kids and the most fertile time for the other woman this rule was probably going to be broken. The most obvious way around this was for Angela to watch the video later, as all encounters were taped but Angela wasn't sure she liked that.

Lastly, there was the fear that Steve and this other woman would start to have feelings for one another in the process of making a baby. Now Steve had never broken any of their hot husband rules. He had always been a great husband and father. Steve had gone out of his way to allay any of her fears usually before she even articulated them. Yet it still nagged at Angela so single women were off the table. If they did this, it would be with a married woman who was having trouble conceiving.

Not surprisingly given the cost of artificial insemination Angela had received quite a few requests of this nature. Angela had decided on one couple in particular and decided it was time to talk to Steve about it. It had been a month since they had ""worked"" the Bachelorette party and they were due for another adventure. Angela decided tonight she would broach the subject with Steve.

Later that night

""Steve, I have been thinking about our next hot husband adventure. I was looking for another Black woman for us, I know you like them and so do I. I found one whose name is Jada, and she is a little younger that us. She has maybe B-cup tits but a nice booty, she is really interested in you. She is especially interested in you knocking her up.""

""Whoa, wait a second, did you say knock her up?""

""Yes, I did. It seems there a quite a few women out there who think you have good genes, and I can't blame them, we have 2 wonderful kids. You aren't hard to look at and have no hereditary medical problems.""

Steve was pretty surprised with the way this conversation was going. He was starting to feel like a stud horse, and it was making him hard.

""Are you sure you are okay with this Angela? It is a pretty intimate act getting someone pregnant. It might even break some of our rules. I don't want anything to jeopardize our great marriage.""

Once again Steve was making Angela love him all the more. He was always thinking of her!

""Jada is pretty desperate. Her husband is infertile, and they have tried other means but have run out of money and hope. They believe this will work; her husband is white so they can pretend it's his. He is fully on board but doesn't want to know the details. Also, Jada wants me to be part of the process, that way we both will be part of it so less chance of any complications. Of course, there will be a legal agreement so they can not come after us later for support or anything. What do you think?

""It sounds pretty hot to me; my cock votes we go ahead.""

Angela had noticed the bulge forming in his pants and quickly moved in for the kill. Before Steve knew it his rock-hard cock was down Angela's' throat. Literally down her throat. In what Steve now thought of as pre--Hot Husband Angela would give him blow jobs because it was an easy way to get him off. She wasn't particularly skilled, and it was mostly a hand job with the tip of his cock in her mouth. It didn't matter however because Steve was always so sexually frustrated that he came pretty quickly.

Now that it was post Hot Husband Angela had amazing blow job skills. She could deep-throat him as she was doing now. This was no small feat as Steve had a large cock. Kalisha and Maria had done it to Steve so Angela had worked at it until she could too. Angela had learned many other tricks and treats, including vibrating her throat, which she also was doing right now. Angela would often draw out the blow job to extend Steve's pleasure. She was so horny now and had to make up for the lost years. She was trying hard to make him cum quick this time so the deep throat, vibrations, and her tongue on his balls had him shooting his load directly into her stomach in no time.

All her practice was certainly paying off for Steve. Steve had received some amazing blow jobs from other women since their hot husband adventures had started. Each time Angela had felt that those women, like Maria, were better than her she had worked to improve. Let's just say Steve was a very happy man.

Angela put Steve's cock away for later and quickly rushed to the computer to send a message to Jada. Jada was online and it was soon decided that in 2 weeks Jada would be at her most fertile and she would come over to stay at their house for 2 days. It would be a Sunday and Monday so Steve and Angela would take Monday off. Angela could not believe it was really going to happen. She had arranged for her husband to make another woman pregnant. Her panties were soaked and the power she felt had her desperate for release. She went back to the bedroom.

2 weeks later

The kids were with Aunt Sophia on Sunday afternoon when Jada arrived at Steve and Angela's house. Steve went to answer the door when Jada rang the bell.

When he opened it there stood a very pretty Black woman. She was wearing a tight knitted dress that accentuated her small breasts and ample ass. Steve could feel his cock twitch as he eagerly anticipated seeing her naked and breeding her.

Steve didn't know if he should shake her hand, hug her, or do nothing. This initial part often was awkward, but Jada wanted a kiss. Steve said hello and offered to take her bag but Jada moved in for a kiss. She tasted like fresh strawberries as their lips met. Jada teased him with the tip of her tongue as the kiss deepened. Steve's tongue responded in kind and soon they were locked in a passionate embrace kissing like lovers. It seemed to last forever until Steve pulled away with her bag and introduced Jada to Angela.

Angela had been busy filming and was very turned on by Steve and Jada's kiss. Jada and Angela exchanged pleasantries and then Jada moved in to kiss Angela. Now Steve was wondering how this was going to go. Angela and Kalisha had shared a sensual kiss but normally Angela wasn't into the women. Angela just wanted Steve to enjoy the women Angela arranged for him. Yet this time Angela had said Jada wanted Angela to be part of the process. This had not been discussed with Steve so he was wondering not only about the kiss but what else might happen. Thinking about his wife doing things with Jada was making his cock hard in his pants.

Jada slipped her arms around Angela's neck and pulled her in for a deep kiss. There was nothing tentative here. From Steve's vantage point, it was dueling tongues from the outset. Angela put her hands on Jada's fine booty and pulled her in closer. Their breasts mashed together as they were about the same height. The kiss deepened and the two women started to grind their hips into each other. Steve's cock was now fully hard and although he wanted in on the action, he just stood in awe as the two women were locked in a passionate kiss and embrace.

Jada broke the kiss with a giggle and then had to catch her breath,

""Angela, I think you are really glad to meet me, I know I am glad to meet you. Steve and you are so gracious to welcome me into your home and do this for us, I can't begin to thank you enough.""

""I sure hope it works and then you can really thank us. Right now, I think we need to get started, Steve hasn't cum in 48 hours, so he has a big load of baby makers to share with you.""

With that, Angela led Jada into the spare bedroom that would be Jada's home and insemination room for the two days.

Steve followed them in. Angela then finally explained what was going to happen.

""Ok, Steve I am going to get both of you ready. I am going to make sure Jada's vagina is nice and lubricated for your beautiful cock. At the same time, I'm going to make sure your cock is rock hard and ready to breed her hard. So how about us three all get naked and started!""

Jada was trying to watch both Angela and Steve undress at the same time while Steve and Angela were both watching Jada. Steve liked how firm her tits were and her pointy little nipples. Angela loved the landing strip above her pussy and her bright pink engorged labia. Soon Jada was lying back on the bed and Angela was kissing her way up her left leg. Jada loved the sensations and couldn't help but let out a moan as Angela moved closer to her pussy. Steve couldn't believe Angela was going to lick Jada's creamy hole. Angela reached her goal by giving Jada's vulva a big lick from her rosebud to her clit. Jada reacted by grabbing Angela's head and moaning loudly.

Angela could not believe how turned-on she was! She didn't think she was bi, but her clit was throbbing, and she could hardly think straight. Angela knew that the idea of having Steve impregnate Jada turned her on. It was the power to do this that was the aphrodisiac she craved to keep her libido on fire. She and Steve were having such great sex and the two of them had never been happier. Angela figured she should just enjoy it and not try to overthink it. Meanwhile, Steve was so intent on watching what was going on he at first didn't hear Jada talking to him.

""Steve, are you going to warm up that sweet piece of meat or what? Slide that big cock into Angela's pussy and get it ready for me. Don't worry if she's ready, her pussy is drooling all over my leg.""

No further encouragement was required for Steve to get behind Angela and slowly enter her hot wet pussy. Steve could hear Angela moan into Jada's sex as he bottomed out. This in turn made Jada even more excited as she wiggled her hips and ground her pussy into Angela's face. Pleasure coursed through her body and Jada almost felt guilty about how much she was enjoying this. Yet she stayed focused on the goal of getting pregnant, no one said she couldn't enjoy the experience. Her husband was pretending she was visiting her sister but knew what she was really doing. This fact and Angela's amazing skills made Jada feel her toes curl. Angela then inserted a finger into Jada's vagina and reached for her G-spot. As soon as Angela made contact Jada's world exploded in a kaleidoscope of ecstasy. She found herself squirting for the first time in her life. Angela was pinned in place and got a face wash in Jada's ejaculation.

Steve heard and saw what had happened so as Jada let go of Angela's head and Angela moved out of the way Steve moved forward. Before Steve could enter Jada's dripping hole however Angela flipped the script. Although Angela always saved her orgasms for Steve she was just too revved up and needed release now. She told Steve to wait a second and positioned herself over Jada's face. Her pussy was weeping juices into Jada's mouth as Angela leaned forward and grabbed Jada's legs. Pulling them up and out she opened Jada up for her breeding. At the same time, she positioned herself so Jada could start to feast on her quivering slit.

Steve couldn't believe the lewd display in front of him and drove his cock into Jada's sopping hole. Jada screamed into Angela's pussy and Steve stopped for a moment thinking he had hurt her.

""No don't stop, I just never came before on the first stroke."" Gasping for breath Jada continued, ""It feels so amazing Steve fuck me hard!""

Steve obliged and started to pound Jada's pleasure center. Jada responded by moaning into Angela's pussy. Jada found Angela's clit and could not believe how hard it was. When she gave that engorged clit a little lick and suck Angela's building orgasm detonated, and her eye's rolled back in her head. All of this was too much for Steve and he sent his baby makers deep into Jada.

Everyone had to stop for a breather. Steve crawled up beside Jada and Angela flopped down on the other side of her. Steve put his arm around each of them and they snuggled in close.

""That was so amazing you too. I have never been with a woman and always wondered what it would be like. Angela for someone who has never eaten pussy before you are a natural. Steve your cock is magical, it is so long and hard I'm sure your sperm got to my egg.""

Jada could hardly contain herself she felt so much emotion from the great sex and the possibility she might finally get pregnant that she started to cry.

""Jada, are you alright?""

Steve was worried that maybe Jada was feeling guilty or something.

""Yes, everything is great, I am with two great people and hopefully I am getting pregnant.""

They continued to lay there on the bed and had a little nap. Steve awoke to a mouth on his cock.

""Come on wake up sleepy head you have more breeding to do before the kids get home.""

Angela made sure he was nice and hard and then left to go put some footage from their initial tryst with Jada on the internet.

Jada meanwhile had been watching Angela suck Steve's cock. She was excited to feel it inside her again. Her husband was a great lover, but Steve could reach places her husband could not. Jada wanted Steve to go as deep as possible this time, so she bent over with her ass up high and proud and her head down on the bed. Steve was admiring the beautiful black booty and started teasing Jada with just the tip of his cock. He loved the contrasting colors and really wanted to fuck Jada's ass, but that was not in the cards right now, so he continued to tease Jada with his cock head. Jada was getting impatient,

""Steve your bastard shove that big baby maker into my pussy, I want you to go as deep as possible! I want you right in my womb, come on breed this Black pussy!""

Steve then slowly moved into her until he could get no further, then he slowly withdrew. After a few minutes of this, Jada begged him to go faster. Steve obliged and soon had a steady rhythm going. Jada was moaning, ""harder"" as he pulled back and ""deeper"" as he drove in. When Steve hit her cervix, she would moan out an ""ahhhhh."" He reached around at the same time grabbed her perky b-cups with his hands and made sure to capture her prominent nipples with his thumb and index finger. As he stroked into her wet hole, he would squeeze her tits but when he hit bottom he would pinch her nipples. Jada's response was intoxicating to Steve, her moan became ""harderrrrr-deeeeeperrrr-ouuuuuh-yesssssssssssss!"" Steve could feel her vagina clench his penis as he pinched her nipples, and she had a mini orgasm. Steve increased the pace and Jada's moans became incoherent as the waves of pleasure washed over her.

Meanwhile, Angela was watching the live feed in their computer room/office. She had finished posting a little bit of their first breeding as a teaser for the longer videos she would edit later. Angela noticed however that people were starting to make comments about her teaser. This made Angela so excited she switched to live feed. Jada had on a little cat mask and Steve was wearing his Zorro style mask so they would remain anonymous. The comments began to increase in volume. Angela could understand it though because what she was watching was crazy hot sex! Steve was hammering away at Jada from behind while squeezing her tits and pinching her nipples. Jada was a quivering mass of orgasming flesh.

Jada was so consumed with pleasure she couldn't even make sounds anymore; she just had her mouth open panting for breath. Angela's clit was throbbing so hard it hurt so she just let the feed run and raced back to the bedroom.

Steve was now pounding so hard into Jada that Angela figured he would break the bed and Jada's pussy at the same time. Then with a huge bellow, Steve started to cum. The whole thing had him so worked up he almost passed out as his baby makers blasted into Jada's womb. Angela pushed him back onto his haunches and quickly gobbled up his cock right to the root. He was still pretty hard, and his cock never had a chance to soften as Angela licked and sucked it like a woman possessed. She then pushed Steve back onto his back so she could impale herself on his steel shaft. Angela's scream of ecstasy as her clit hit his pubic bone was so loud it succeeded in rousing Jada from her blissful comatose state.

Jada slowly moved herself until she was seated in between Steve's legs behind Angela who continued to bounce up and down on Steve's cock. Jada moved her hands around to grasp Angela's big breasts and capture her nipples just as Steve had captured hers. As Jada soon picked up the rhythm of their fucking and was squeezing Angela's tits until Angela was down and then pinched her nipples. The effect on Angela was similar to that of Jada. Soon Angela was making unintelligible noises as she rode the pleasure train of continuous orgasm.

Steve was starting to come out of his post-orgasm fog and moved his right hand so he could rub Angela's clit. He hardly touched it when Angela let out a squeal and squirted all over Steve. Jada let go of Angela's tits and Angela slumped onto Steve's chest. Jada wasn't sure if Angela had passed out or not, but she wasn't moving so she just snuggled up to the couple.

The exhausted trio awoke to the sound of the door slamming open and Steve and Anglela's children screaming hello. Steve was dressed first and went downstairs to greet his children and Sophia. The kids didn't pick up on what had been happening while they were gone but Sophia did. She grinned at Steve and asked him in a low voice how his stud duties were going. Angela soon joined the rest of them in the living room and as Jada stayed behind in the guest room to hopefully let the baby makers do their job.

There was plenty of excitement as the kids told Angela and Steve all about the fun they had with their aunt. After the kids ran out of things to say Steve told them to get ready for bed and followed them upstairs. The kids thought it was cool that they had a visitor, as their dad introduced them to Jada, who was going to spend the night. Jada looked at Angela and Steve's children and started to cry. Between the amazing sex and her longing for her own children, she was an emotional mess. When the kids asked her what was wrong, she said they were tears of joy at meeting such wonderful children.",,2025-08-15T19:12:48.350902,3728,
https://www.literotica.com/s/sweet-anticipation-pt-05,Sweet Anticipation Pt. 05,Unknown Author,,,,,"Erica's mind raced, wondering if her Master meant he wanted her to please him now, or if he wanted Nicole to do it. Or maybe he wanted both of them to please him. She squirmed as he kept his firm grip in her hair, their eyes locked as she waited breathlessly to find out.

He leaned in to kiss her lips before he guided her head down into his lap, her lips pressing to the head of his cock. She moaned and parted her lips, taking him within the wet heat of her mouth, the salty taste of his precum instantly filling her senses. Erica sucked voraciously on his rigid length, losing herself in her hunger for him, almost forgetting Nicole's presence next to them until she felt the other woman's fingers brushing against her nipples. A shiver of longing travelled down her spine as the touch reawakened her own burning need, and she moaned around her Master's cock.

""Lay back on the couch, Nicole, and spread your legs for me,"" her Master said, and Erica squirmed, turning to watch the beautiful Goddess even as she kept sucking with an urgent hunger.

Nicole laid back, with her head resting on the arm of the couch, and she spread her legs wide in their direction, displaying the soft pussy lips that Erica had just worshipped so reverently. Droplets of her pleasure were still visible around Nicole's delicate pink folds, and Erica whimpered, remembering the way the Goddess had tasted. She heard her Master groan as he watched the other woman too.

""May I touch you, Nicole?"" he asked.

""Yes, Paul. Please do,"" Nicole responded, pulling her thighs wider as an invitation.

Erica moaned and pulled off her Master's cock, her lips making a wet popping sound as she did so. She watched as he reached out to Nicole, his thick fingers running along the silken petals before one digit disappeared inside the Goddess, causing her to moan and arch her back.

""Don't forget about my cock, little kitten. You may use your hand if you wish to watch what we are doing.""

With a quiet whimper, Erica nodded her head and reached out to wrap her small hand around his shaft, stroking him. The wetness of her saliva that coated him helped her fist to glide up and down his throbbing length. She couldn't look away as her Master touched Nicole, watching as he dipped a second finger into the other woman's molten core and slid them in and out. Each time his fingers almost pulled all the way out, Erica could see how much they glistened with Nicole's nectar, and the sight made her squirm.

God, she was so needy. But she did not know what she craved the most. The feel of her Master's cock throbbing within her grip made her want to suck him off until he was moaning and feeding her his cum. The sight of Nicole's wetness coating his fingers made Erica crave to lean in and pleasure the Goddess with her tongue all over again. And seeing the way he touched Nicole made her desperate to feel his touch too, wanting to experience the pleasure that he was giving to her at this moment. But Erica had always put the pleasure of others first, and the thought of being here to focus on pleasing both of them while her own need was barely thought of was something that caused an uncontrollable ache between her thighs. She was her Master's pleasure slave, and that was what she needed more than anything.

With renewed focus, Erica pumped her fist faster up and down his slick shaft, whimpering every time it throbbed in her hand. His moans joined with Nicole's as his fingers continued to thrust in and out of her. Erica could hear how wet the other woman was each time that he drove his fingers deep into her sex. The sounds of pleasure were driving Erica wild with need, and she turned back to her Master, taking his cock back into her mouth to suck. She gagged on him, saliva leaking from her lips to slide down the shaft as she took him as deep as possible in her throat. His loud moans were all the reward she needed as she concentrated on making him feel as good as she could.

Nicole's moans were growing louder and the sloppy sounds coming from her pussy told Erica that her Master was pounding his fingers hard into their guest. All of a sudden, Nicole cried out with pleasure, and Erica lifted her head to watch the beautiful brunette in the throes of passion. Her back arched, and she threw her head back, her body shuddering with the force of her release.

Erica watched with awe until her Master leaned to growl against her ear.

""Move closer to Nicole, kitten. I want you kissing her and showering her with attention while I fuck her.""

She froze for a moment, shocked by her Master's words. He was going to fuck Nicole? Again, there was that nagging voice in the back of her mind, telling her she should hate the idea of the man she loves fucking another woman. But, in reality, the thought of watching them together made her drip with desire.

Erica moved onto her hands and knees and crawled closer to where Nicole laid with her head on the arm of the couch. The other woman reached out to cup her face, drawing her closer until their lips met. Erica whimpered into the kiss and she felt her Master's weight shift on the couch as he laid himself on top of Nicole. The Goddess moaned then, as he filled her with his cock, and Erica deepened the kiss, eager to devour those sounds of pleasure.

As she felt their bodies move against one another, Erica couldn't help but pull back from the kiss, needing to watch her Master taking the beautiful woman laid beneath him. She moaned, and her core clenched with her own desperate desire, feeling her own emptiness as her Master thrust deep into Nicole over and over. Erica had seen nothing as beautiful or arousing as the sight in front of her, Nicole clinging to her Master as they took their own pleasure from one another.

""Touch yourself, kitten,"" her Master growled. ""Fuck yourself with your fingers while you watch us.""

Without hesitation, Erica reached down between her thighs and slipped two fingers deep into her sex. She was soaked, her juices coating her fingers as she fucked herself with the digits, moaning with the pleasure of being filled, even if it was only with her own fingers.

No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't stop staring at the two people on the couch, watching as their bodies moved faster, their hips slamming together at a frantic pace as her Master fucked Nicole with breath-taking force. God, Erica would have done anything to feel him inside her, stretching her deliciously as he used her. But this... this just felt right. Nicole was a fucking Goddess, and she deserved every bit of pleasure that he could give to her.

Erica thrust her fingers harder, and her moans joined the chorus that Nicole and her Master had created. It wasn't long before Nicole cried out with pleasure as she reached her climax on his cock, and moments later, Erica watched as her Master shuddered with his release, filling the Goddess with his cum. Before she could stop herself, Erica tumbled over the edge with them, her pussy clamping tight around her own fingers as the orgasm washed over her. Their breathless moans filled the room as the three of them reached their peak together.

With some disappointment, Erica watched as her Master slipped out of Nicole and sat between her thighs. For some reason that she couldn't name, she didn't want this to end. She craved to stay here and watch her Master fuck Nicole again. She wanted to hear their moans and see their pleasure.

Erica whimpered as she noticed her Master motioning for her to come closer, and she crawled back to him, settling on her knees at his feet. He cupped her face in his large hands and he leaned to brush his lips against hers, kissing her with a tenderness that warmed her heart and caused a tear to form in her eye.

""You've been such a good girl, Erica, and you deserve a treat,"" he said, smiling at her, his eyes shining with love.

His words of praise filled her with happiness, and she smiled. ""Thank you, Master. And thank you for bringing Miss Nicole home today. I loved every minute.""

Erica turned her gaze towards the Goddess still laid on the couch and smiled, wanting Nicole to see how truly happy she was feeling. She was rewarded with a dazzling smile from Nicole in return.

""You're very welcome, kitten,"" her Master said, and she turned back to look at him. ""Now, for your reward..."" His words trailed off, and he gestured between Nicole's parted thighs, where creamy drops of his cum oozed out of her.

Erica moaned, and she squirmed on her knees. ""Is this my reward, Master? Please may I clean Miss now?""

Her Master nodded and settled back into the couch to watch as Erica leaned in between the other woman's thighs. With a hunger unlike anything else she had ever felt, she licked at Nicole's sex, tasting the Goddess' pleasure mixing with her Master's. Erica plunged her tongue deep into the other woman, feasting on her in an effort to lap up every drop of her Master's cum. Nicole moaned and writhed, pressing her sex against Erica's mouth so that Erica could clean her more easily.

After a few minutes, Erica felt Nicole's hand in her hair, pulling her away from her reward. ""That's enough, pretty pet. Otherwise, you'll have me wanting a second round with your Master.""

Nicole laughed, and Erica thought she might have been joking, but she squirmed at the suggestion of a second round, anyway.

""Okay, kitten, it's time to put your belt back on now.""

Erica let out a pitiful whine at her Master's words, but she didn't argue. She went to fetch her chastity belt and brought it back to her Master, standing quietly as he put it back on her and locked it into place. She couldn't deny that she wished she'd been able to feel her Master inside her during her brief freedom from the belt, but the denial only made her ache for him even more.

Once he was finished, Master pulled Erica into his lap to hold her close, and Nicole moved closer to them both, resting a head on his shoulder as he draped an arm around her. As Erica snuggled into her Master's embrace, and reached out to hold Nicole's hand, she let out a happy little sigh and hoped that this would not be the last time the three of them enjoyed one another.",,2025-08-15T19:12:56.104357,1840,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-millers-ch-04,The Millers Ch. 04,Unknown Author,,,,,"It's been forever since I had a weekend off from the restaurant but I was happy to have it so I was really looking forward to my free time. Unfortunately, when you are in a contract which you have signed your freedom away for six months you don't really have free time. I was reminded of this when I walked in the door Thursday night and saw my bag packed waiting for me by the door.

Robby was still at work so Kayla saw me off and reminded me that her and Robby would be making love all weekend and with any luck he would impregnate her as she was ovulating and had been off the pill for months now. She looked me directly in the eye and spit into mine as a going away present.

""Hey on the bright side you may get to orgasm this weekend, that will be up to your On loan Mistress."" Kayla joked as she opened the front door to welcome my ""on loan Mistress.""

I recognized the voice and in walked my Mom.

""Hi honey"" she said and gave me a big hug. ""It's your dad's birthday this weekend and Robby and I decided that he was due something special for his 50th birthday."" ""You are that something special!""

""What the fuck?"" I blurted out.

""It will be good honey"" mom tried to re-assure me.

""I have a busy weekend away with William my latest lover but felt bad for your cucky father."" . . ""he tries so hard to please me that he deserves something nice so You are it.""

I just shook my head, not knowing what else to say and knowing that I really had no choice in the matter. I picked up my bag and followed Mom out the door to the car.

The two hour drive was awkward and not much was said between mother and daughter. Protocol required that the sub not make small talk with the Domme so I just tried to mentally prepare myself for a weekend with my sissy cuckolded father wondering what the hell was going to be required of me over the next 48 hours.

As we got closer to their house Mom decided to go over the rules. She said that Dad was going to be in charge and that I would do WHATEVER he decided and of course my safe word still was in play if necessary but she never knew of me actually using the word.

She didn't even come in but instead dropped me off at the curb and told me to behave myself but to have a good time and off she went headed to Chicago for the weekend.

I walked in the door and Dad welcomed me with a big hug. He was not dressed in his usual sissy outfit but instead he was dressed as more of a Dom and told me to get him a beer and meet him in the living room. I set down my bag and did as I was told. On the kitchen counter was a note that explained what our scene was going to look like for the rest of the evening. I read it carefully and quickly tried to prepare myself mentally for what was about to happen.

I walked into the living room and Dad was sitting back on the couch. I gave him his beer and then walked to the center of the room and slowly stripped my clothes off as the note stated. In a couple of minutes I was stark naked standing before my father. He had never seen me completely naked before and he motioned for me to come closer which I did compliantly.

Dad's eyes looked me up and down for several minutes and I saw his tongue lick his lips before he spoke.

""You miss your brother don't you Sis?""

Sis was his nickname for me when I was growing up.

""Yes Daddy"" I said.

He motioned me to sit on his lap which I did feeling his rock hard cock fighting the containment his pants were providing. He adjusted me so that my pussy was directly resting on his manhood as he pulled me in closer and kissed me directly on the mouth.

He whispered in my ear as he brushed my hair back as he explained that he wanted to be in Robby's place but by the time I was 18 my mother had already cuckolded him so it was too late and Robby got me instead. Now that I was 21 I guess he felt that he had a chance to see what it would be like to be lovers with his young hot daughter.

He then stuck his tongue back into my mouth as he began to grope and feel me up with his 50 year old man hands. He picked me up and carried me into the bedroom and gently laid me down on the bed and stripped himself.

He joined me in bed and proceeded to make vanilla love to me, spending close to an hour between my legs sending me into multiple orgasmic convulsions as he showed off how utterly unbelievably talented he was with his tongue.

Although he did not have a cock nearly as large as my brother he really knew how to use it as he fucked me every which way but loose. I was truly spent when he got done with me and he offered to clean his sperm out of my pussy but I said no because, at that moment in time, I wanted his baby makers to fight the good fight and put a baby in my belly. We fell asleep in each others arms.

The next morning we continued where we left off and although we were covered in sweat, cum and other stickiness we went for several more hours. Maybe it was because I hadn't been allowed to orgasm by my Master and Mistress for nearly a month or maybe I was just that taken by my father's mad lovemaking skills.

After a shower of us both pleasing each other yet again we went out for a nice birthday dinner and returned for yet another night of unbridled love making.

I heard the front door early and Mom was standing at the edge of the bed looking at her husband and her daughter sleeping together locked in a spoon position.

""Alright you two horn dogs"" ""Time to go""

""Hope you had fun cucky"" she sneered at him, ""back to your regular gig now.""

She grabbed me and pulled me out of the bed and told me to hurry because my ride was leaving.

Turns out William was taking me home as he drove to Detroit and saved Mom four hours worth of driving. ""Make sure you are nice to William, Ciara"" said Mom. ""He is being nice driving you home for me."" She said.

Great I thought to myself as I rushed out the door, barely getting to say goodbye to my new favorite lover. I drove with William and he pulled into the drive way and carried my bag into the house for me. Figured he was being a gentleman but yet what was I thinking? He wanted to fuck me and he quickly made it obvious that he was not leaving until I offered myself to him like my mother had spent the weekend doing to him.

Not even trying to fight him off I just did what he wanted and he threw me around on the couch like a rag doll which is what I felt like. He had the largest cock I had ever seen and spent the next hour fucking all of my holes with it, gagging me and choking me like I had not done since I could remember. Rarely would a cock be too much for me to handle. The fucker had the balls to face time my Mom while I was choking on his massive cock. What the fuck? Forced her to watch as he finally blew his nut down my throat made me swallow his cum. Nice guy my Mom has there. She must have known what was in store for me. Thanks for the force sex Mom. Thanks for the ride William, next time I'll take the train.

Til next time. . .",,2025-08-15T19:13:03.112774,1397,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-loving-husband-ch-21,The Loving Husband Ch. 21,Unknown Author,,,,,"The short synopsis of this story to date is included below, but reading the previous chapters may help. Also, in this chapter, I explore something that was recommended by a reviewer.

*****

This is the continuing story of a cuckquean, my wife, Ann. She had been reading cuckold stories on line and decided that she was a cuckquean, a kind of female cuckold. This was based on how enthralled and excited she became by imagining me having sex with other women. I was shocked, but she pursued it. She didn't show any tendencies toward the humiliation or denial part, but loved knowing I was having sex with other women. Apparently, this started with some voyeuristic tendencies about watching someone she was involved with have sex with another woman when she was in college and now she got off on thinking I was having sex with other women. I didn't understand it, but she pursued it and I started doing so.

In the last chapter, the now pregnant Anita, who was just showing, and Violet and Don came over. Violet had found out that her husband liked her being a hot wife and discovered that he had been reading a lot of the Loving Wives stories on Literotica. She decided to come back and Anita came along. I had fun fucking them both and she teased her husband both physically and mentally as we did. She got him to agree to some rules and let him watch as I filled her pussy from behind, my cock and balls pulsating as I filled her up.

---

For the next couple of weeks, Ann and I enjoyed some relaxing time, if you can call it that when you have two kids, with all the prerequisite activities. It was a Friday and I had just gotten home from work when Ann came up to the bedroom as I changed.

""The kids are finishing their homework and dinner will be ready soon. You need to dress for going out tonight.""

""We're going out?"" I was confused. Didn't she just say that dinner would be ready soon?

""Not us. You. Violet called with a request and I said that you'd love to show her.""

I grinned. This had to be good, right? ""Show her what?""

""She's never been to a strip club, but her sister-in-law told her she went to one last week and it was fun, even though it was a bunch of women stripping. Of course, her sister doesn't know that Violet likes women, too.""

""Okay. That sounds interesting. What should I wear?""

My wife walked over and picked up the dress pants I had just taken off. ""These are perfect. They are a bit light and flimsy enough to feel your nice cock when it gets hard.""

""When it gets hard?""

""You don't think you'll get an erection in a strip club with Violet?""

""Okay, okay, you're right.""

""Now wear these without underwear and a nice polo that let's Violet or the dancers run their hands over your upper body.""

""I'm not exactly a body-builder.""

""No, but I'm sure they will love to run their hands over you.""

""Okay, I got it. Now let's get back to dinner. I don't think I want to go to a strip club and drink on an empty stomach.""

Ann turned to leave and tossed her last statement over her shoulder. ""I don't think the status of your stomach will matter, just your balls.""

I grinned and did as she said. I went downstairs and had dinner with my family. The kids were growing up and being wonderful. They were so well-behaved. Amy, my little princess, loved telling me stories about her day. She seemed to love being the one telling stories and making people laugh.

Ann told me that Violet was coming over at 10, so we got the kids ready for bed and let them stay up and watch one of their favorite movies, Finding Nemo.

They were watching when Violet arrived, so I gave them a hug and kiss and said good night. Not sure they even noticed, as engrossed as they were in the movie.

I greeted Violet at the door and gave her a quick ""Wow!"" She was dressed in a tight slinky dress like the young 20-somethings wear when going out clubbing. It was pretty short, tight as hell around her large tits and nice hips. Her ass was a vision as she led me to her car. I gave it a good smack and she giggled and shook it.

""You look good enough to eat in that dress.""

""Thank you."" She went to the passenger side. ""You're driving. You know where it is.""

I opened her door and watched her get in. She spread her legs as she did and grinned as she made it known that she was not wearing panties.

""Scrumptious.""

Violet grinned. ""Hope so.""

I went around and got behind the wheel of her car. ""I haven't been to this place, either.""

""I thought you had been to all the strip clubs around here. I thought all the men went.""

I chuckled. ""I don't really like to go to them because they are just a long tease. And besides, I'm getting plenty of attention with all the ladies I'm seeing.""

""You mean all the ladies you're fucking?"" She gave me a sly grin. ""Well, according to my sister-in-law, she and my brother went with another couple and it wasn't just a long tease. My brother didn't do anything, but the other guy confided in him that you could negotiate a nice little blowjob or fuck for the right price in the 30 minute private dance areas.""

""Really?""

""That's what my brother eventually told Shari, my sister-in-law. She told me when we got drunk together last weekend while the boys were playing golf.""

""And what is her position on all this extraneous sex?""

""Well, I probed her delicately, and found that she isn't getting enough cock from my brother, but is unsure what to do about it. I loaned her a vibrator and she blushed just looking at it. But I think eventually, I'll be able to get her to open up. I might even be able to get you a fuck with her.""

I turned in the seat to fully face Violet. ""Who are you and what did you do with that shy, quiet woman who was unsure about this a few weeks ago.""

Violet grinned. ""Well, I'm now a full-fledged hot wife. I can fuck and suck whichever cock interests me and then run home and tell my husband, who gets very excited about it. I wouldn't do any of this if he didn't get so damn excited about it. That just makes it even better for me. I get to enjoy other men, which I didn't when I was young, and my husband is insatiable when I talk about it. I'm getting it all the time now. And now that we are doing this he wants some pictures and maybe even short video clips from my phone.""

""Whoa. What a change."" I turned and started the car. ""Now, let's see if we can find that strip club and see some women take their clothes off and rub their delicious bodies up against us.""

""Amen.""

We drove for about 45 minutes to get to the one that Violet was referred to by her sister-in-law. It looked like most of them I had seen. No windows, flashy neon sign, a large solid door behind which the pounding of the music could be heard as we approached. We entered and found ourselves at a counter where I was expected to pay a $10 cover charge. Women were free. Great. I paid and we entered the club.

When we walked into the club, there were two stages. There was one directly in front of where we entered that was a large rectangular raised area with two poles on it. The stage was about 20 feet wide and 8 feet deep. It had a foot wide counter running around it about a foot below the level of the stage. There were about a dozen chairs pulled up to that counter all around it, half of them occupied.

The second stage was over to the right and was about half the size of the main one. It was also about 50% occupied. There was a scattering of about 30 tables and chairs around the rest of the room and they were scarcely occupied.

We went to a table, sat down, and a waitress came to our table. She was dressed in a skirt that barely cupped the cheeks of her ass and thigh highs that were black fishnet. Her top was a size too small and partially unbuttoned so that her bra covered tits were bursting out of it. We both ordered a light beer to keep from getting too drunk.

I then noticed an area off to the left of the main stage that had an opening that led to a dark hallway. There was a bouncer or monitor at a counter at the entrance. I figured this was where the private dance area was.

Violet was sitting right next to me and she leaned over and pointed at the woman on the main stage. She was a petite brunette with b-cup tits and upwards pointing nipples. She was taking off her little G-string. The music was changing to a new song and she started shaking to the tune. She was playing up to one of the guys sitting there and turned around and looked at him from between her legs. He stared up at her and her pussy, which she ran her hand over.

She then squatted with her legs spread, giving him a good look at her shaved pussy as she pulled back on a garter that was around her left thigh. The guy put a couple of bucks in there and she then moved towards the next one. She worked her way around the stage as far as she could during what turned out to be her last song. When it ended the DJ called for the next dancer and the brunette gathered up her stuff and put her G-string and flashy top back on. She also put a light, gauzy jacket on.

When she left the stage she headed out into the crowd and seemed to be asking about table dances. The first two tables of guys said no, but when she looked our way, I made eye contact and gave her a little come to us move with my left hand. She grinned and scampered over, well as much as a woman can scamper in those ridiculously high stripper heels.

When she got to us, she just walked up and sat on my lap. I asked her name and she said Jasmine. Typical fake name. She asked about the two of us. I just grinned and told her I wanted her to give Violet a table dance. She said it was $20 so I pulled it out. Violet couldn't hear us over the music, but we both smiled at her and talked until the song ended. I ran my hands over her hip and ass while she was sitting there. Her skin was very smooth. I could also tell that she was very young.

When the song was ending, Jasmine got up and went over to Violet. She removed her gauzy top and put it on the other chair at the table. She approached Violet and pushed her legs apart as the song started. Violet looked over at me and mouthed thank you.

Jasmine proceeded to give Violet a table dance. First she rubbed up against her and slowly slid down her body, making sure to drag herself across Violet's tits and the rest of her. Then she turned around and sat on Violet's lap, between her legs, and leaned back. They said something to each other and Jasmine glanced my way. Then she stood up and removed her bra-like top. She rubbed up against Violet, who tried to capture a nipple in her mouth. Jasmine jerked away with a grin and shook her finger at Violet. She leaned over and said something to her, probably explaining what the no-touching rule was. Then she pointed over to where the private dance area was and they talked.

After that, Jasmine kept rubbing her tits against Violet's body, up and down. When the song ended, Violet leaned over toward me to talk loud enough for us to hear. ""I don't want to wait to check out any other girls. I want to take this one in the back.""

""Okay. What's the deal?""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean what does it cost? What do we get? What will she do?""

""It's $250 for 30 minutes. I guess she'll dance and let us play a little.""

I waved to Jasmine and patted my lap. She sat down. I put my left hand on her hip, loving the feel of the bare skin. She was definitely a nice piece of ass.

""So what's the deal with the private area?""

""It's $250 for thirty minutes. It's completely private.""

""And what are we going to do back there.""

She grinned. ""Well, I really like your wife."" She reached down and grabbed my left hand and pointed to the ring. ""So I think maybe we can play a little.""

""You're going to have to be more specific. Will you eat her pussy? Will you suck my cock? What?""

Jasmine looked at me closely and grinned. ""Well, I think I'd love to play with your wife. Will she eat my pussy?""

""Of course. She loves pussy. What about me?""

""We can play, too. I have a condom to make sure you and I can play.""

I looked at her. It's not like a stripper to be coy. ""You mean you'll suck me or fuck me?""

She grinned. ""Okay, you want me to say it. I usually don't out here. I like to talk in there.""

""It's too late in there. I want to make sure we know what to expect before I fork over some money.""

""Yeah, I can see that.""

""And I also want you to know that I tip well.""

Jasmine grinned. ""Then let's go. I'll suck and fuck you and let your wife eat my pussy."" She started to get up and then stopped for a second. ""It will be best if you tip the guy out front who leads us to the room, too.""

I motioned to Violet and we all stood up and headed for the private area. She joined hands with both of us and led us back to the beginning of the private area. She spoke to the monitor who nodded. He led us back to a long hallway that had small rooms on either side with couches. The hallway was painted dark, grey or black. The small rooms were also dark grey or black. The curtains were definitely grey and the couches a dark brown.

He showed us to one of the larger ones with full couches and curtains in front. I turned and handed him a $20 and he nodded thanks. We moved into the room and he turned to pull the curtains closed. He said to Jasmine, ""30 minutes"".

The music was more subdued in here and we could actually hear enough to talk to each other. Violet sat down on the one side of the couch and I on her left as we were sitting. Jasmine smiled at us and took off all but her G-string and heels. She turned to Violet first and grinned. ""Do you and your husband do this often?""

Violet looked at me and grinned. ""He's not my husband. He and I are married, but not to each other. We're just fuck buddies.""

Jasmine looked back and forth between us, questions appearing to her as she looked at us, but she said nothing. She just shrugged and turned to Violet. She pushed Violet's legs apart and started dancing. She leaned against her and slowly slipped down Violet's front until she was on her knees between Violet's legs. She reached up and ran her hand over Violet's tits. Violet immediately put her hands on the straps of her dress and pulled them down over her shoulders. Jasmine grinned and helped Violet pull her dress down over her tits, leaving the large, beautiful mounds exposed to both of us. Jasmine leaned forward slowly and Violet put her hands on Jasmine's head, guiding her to the nipple of her right tit. Jasmine sucked and Violet let out a deep sigh. I leaned over and sucked on her left.

Violet put one hand on each of our heads and just enjoyed our sucking. I put my hand on her thigh and ran it up as far as I could to, dragging her dress with it. Jasmine turned to me and grinned. We pulled back and she grabbed Violet by her legs just above the knees and pulled. Violet understood what she was doing and lifted up, sliding down into a slouch against the couch. This also had the effect of sliding her dress up further.

Jasmine looked up at Violet, who was staring down at her, and slowly ran a single finger up her slit and over her clit. Violet just leaned back and moaned.

I leaned forward closer to Jasmine. ""She's a horny little bitch who will do anything once you get her motor running.""

Jasmine grinned. ""Me, too.""

I smiled at that. ""Then let's do this.""

Jasmine then stood and kicked off her shoes and pulled her G-string off. She leaned over to me. ""Get your cock out.""

That sounded easier than it was. I didn't want to take my pants off, but I had to open them up and slide them down a little so my cock would be free enough to be available. When I got it out and it reached to the sky, it was already nice and hard.

Jasmine was now running two fingers into Violet while she sucked on a nipple. When I sat back down with my cock sticking up, she pulled off Violet's tit and looked at my cock. ""Oh, good, a nice cock. The last guy had barely four inches.""

""Yeah, but he paid to get off and he did, right?""

""Oh, yeah. My customers never leave unhappy.""

Jasmine stopped what she was doing to Violet and turned to her small purse. She opened it and extracted a condom. She pulled it out and turned to me. ""I'll put it on.""

She grabbed my cock by the base and positioned the condom over the top. I had heard that there were women who would take the condom into their mouths and put it on by running their mouth down your cock. But Jasmine didn't do that. She used the conventional method. When she got it on, she grinned up at me. ""It's very hard. I like them very hard.""

I smiled, not really knowing if that was the truth or she was just playing to me to get me off and get a decent tip. Anyway, she then abandoned my cock and leaned over to whisper something in Violet's ear. Violet looked at me with a funny grin and nodded. Jasmine came over to me and knelt between my legs. She grabbed my cock and started blowing me.

I'm not sure how it must feel to the woman to blow a guy wearing a condom, but it felt very strange to me, even though the condom was very thin. Violet knelt next to me and lifted a tit to my lips. I suckled and just reveled in the action I was getting for a couple of minutes. I pulled back and looked up at Violet.

""You enjoying this?""

She grinned a funny grin again. ""Yes, but it will get much better.""

""Yeah? Better than having a women with great big tits feed them to me while another woman blows me?""

""Oh, yes."" She giggled and patted Jasmine on the shoulder. Jasmine grinned and stood up. So did Violet.

Now what?

Well, the girls got into a great position. Jasmine turned around and sat on my lap, her back to me, trapping my cock against my stomach. Violet moved around in front of the two of us and knelt between Jasmine's legs. Jasmine leaned back against me and put her head on my shoulder. We both watched as Violet moved to eat her pussy. Violet didn't waste time and immediately started eating Jasmine's pussy. Jasmine moaned.

Jasmine then turned to me. ""I'm now going to sit on your cock and Violet is going to eat my pussy. Ready?""

""Always!""

Jasmine leaned forward and Violet sat back. Jasmine lifted herself up and lined her pussy up with my cock. She slowly worked it into her pussy and finally got all the way down. She sat with her back straight up and started slowly moving on my cock. She said something to Violet that I didn't hear, but suddenly she moaned and started jerking back and forth as I figured Violet made contact with her pussy.

I then felt Violet's tongue on my balls. Jasmine turned toward me. ""You're right. She is a horny bitch, isn't she?""

""Yes, she is.""

Violet licked and sucked on my balls and Jasmine's pussy for a few minutes, then stood up. Jasmine leaned forward and starting sucking on her left nipple. Violet had a sharp intake of breath and then pulled away. ""I need to get fucked. Lay down Jasmine so that I can eat your pussy while John fucks me.""

Jasmine slowly pushed up off my cock. She moaned. ""I was just getting into it. I don't normally get too excited with all the traffic I see in here, but you two had me getting there.""

Violet helped her up and then grabbed both her nipples. ""Relax, you stripper slut. I'll work on getting you off while John fucks me. I really need him to fuck me."" I stood up to make room.

Jasmine lay back against one arm of the couch, her right knee on the couch and her left foot on the floor, and Violet knelt between her legs. Violet lifted her ass up in the air as she dove into Jasmine's pussy.

I had a great target and I figured I would leave the condom on, in case I got another chance at Jasmine. I moved forward and slid into the hot pussy of Violet. Her hips are perfectly sized for looking good and for grabbing onto as you fuck her. I grabbed them and started fucking her with gusto. Once she gets going, she loves to cum.

For the next couple of weeks, Ann and I enjoyed some relaxing time, if you can call it that when you have two kids, with all the prerequisite activities. It was a Friday and I had just gotten home from work when Ann came up to the bedroom as I changed.

""The kids are finishing their homework and dinner will be ready soon. You need to dress for going out tonight.""

""We're going out?"" I was confused. Didn't she just say that dinner would be ready soon?

""Not us. You. Violet called with a request and I said that you'd love to show her.""

I grinned. This had to be good, right? ""Show her what?""

""She's never been to a strip club, but her sister-in-law told her she went to one last week and it was fun, even though it was a bunch of women stripping. Of course, her sister doesn't know that Violet likes women, too.""

""Okay. That sounds interesting. What should I wear?""

My wife walked over and picked up the dress pants I had just taken off. ""These are perfect. They are a bit light and flimsy enough to feel your nice cock when it gets hard.""

""When it gets hard?""

""You don't think you'll get an erection in a strip club with Violet?""

""Okay, okay, you're right.""

""Now wear these without underwear and a nice polo that let's Violet or the dancers run their hands over your upper body.""

""I'm not exactly a body-builder.""

""No, but I'm sure they will love to run their hands over you.""

""Okay, I got it. Now let's get back to dinner. I don't think I want to go to a strip club and drink on an empty stomach.""

Ann turned to leave and tossed her last statement over her shoulder. ""I don't think the status of your stomach will matter, just your balls.""

I grinned and did as she said. I went downstairs and had dinner with my family. The kids were growing up and being wonderful. They were so well-behaved. Amy, my little princess, loved telling me stories about her day. She seemed to love being the one telling stories and making people laugh.

Ann told me that Violet was coming over at 10, so we got the kids ready for bed and let them stay up and watch one of their favorite movies, Finding Nemo.

They were watching when Violet arrived, so I gave them a hug and kiss and said good night. Not sure they even noticed, as engrossed as they were in the movie.

I greeted Violet at the door and gave her a quick ""Wow!"" She was dressed in a tight slinky dress like the young 20-somethings wear when going out clubbing. It was pretty short, tight as hell around her large tits and nice hips. Her ass was a vision as she led me to her car. I gave it a good smack and she giggled and shook it.

""You look good enough to eat in that dress.""

""Thank you."" She went to the passenger side. ""You're driving. You know where it is.""

I opened her door and watched her get in. She spread her legs as she did and grinned as she made it known that she was not wearing panties.

""Scrumptious.""

Violet grinned. ""Hope so.""

I went around and got behind the wheel of her car. ""I haven't been to this place, either.""

""I thought you had been to all the strip clubs around here. I thought all the men went.""

I chuckled. ""I don't really like to go to them because they are just a long tease. And besides, I'm getting plenty of attention with all the ladies I'm seeing.""

""You mean all the ladies you're fucking?"" She gave me a sly grin. ""Well, according to my sister-in-law, she and my brother went with another couple and it wasn't just a long tease. My brother didn't do anything, but the other guy confided in him that you could negotiate a nice little blowjob or fuck for the right price in the 30 minute private dance areas.""

""Really?""

""That's what my brother eventually told Shari, my sister-in-law. She told me when we got drunk together last weekend while the boys were playing golf.""

""And what is her position on all this extraneous sex?""

""Well, I probed her delicately, and found that she isn't getting enough cock from my brother, but is unsure what to do about it. I loaned her a vibrator and she blushed just looking at it. But I think eventually, I'll be able to get her to open up. I might even be able to get you a fuck with her.""

I turned in the seat to fully face Violet. ""Who are you and what did you do with that shy, quiet woman who was unsure about this a few weeks ago.""

Violet grinned. ""Well, I'm now a full-fledged hot wife. I can fuck and suck whichever cock interests me and then run home and tell my husband, who gets very excited about it. I wouldn't do any of this if he didn't get so damn excited about it. That just makes it even better for me. I get to enjoy other men, which I didn't when I was young, and my husband is insatiable when I talk about it. I'm getting it all the time now. And now that we are doing this he wants some pictures and maybe even short video clips from my phone.""

""Whoa. What a change."" I turned and started the car. ""Now, let's see if we can find that strip club and see some women take their clothes off and rub their delicious bodies up against us.""

""Amen.""

We drove for about 45 minutes to get to the one that Violet was referred to by her sister-in-law. It looked like most of them I had seen. No windows, flashy neon sign, a large solid door behind which the pounding of the music could be heard as we approached. We entered and found ourselves at a counter where I was expected to pay a $10 cover charge. Women were free. Great. I paid and we entered the club.

When we walked into the club, there were two stages. There was one directly in front of where we entered that was a large rectangular raised area with two poles on it. The stage was about 20 feet wide and 8 feet deep. It had a foot wide counter running around it about a foot below the level of the stage. There were about a dozen chairs pulled up to that counter all around it, half of them occupied.

The second stage was over to the right and was about half the size of the main one. It was also about 50% occupied. There was a scattering of about 30 tables and chairs around the rest of the room and they were scarcely occupied.

We went to a table, sat down, and a waitress came to our table. She was dressed in a skirt that barely cupped the cheeks of her ass and thigh highs that were black fishnet. Her top was a size too small and partially unbuttoned so that her bra covered tits were bursting out of it. We both ordered a light beer to keep from getting too drunk.

I then noticed an area off to the left of the main stage that had an opening that led to a dark hallway. There was a bouncer or monitor at a counter at the entrance. I figured this was where the private dance area was.

Violet was sitting right next to me and she leaned over and pointed at the woman on the main stage. She was a petite brunette with b-cup tits and upwards pointing nipples. She was taking off her little G-string. The music was changing to a new song and she started shaking to the tune. She was playing up to one of the guys sitting there and turned around and looked at him from between her legs. He stared up at her and her pussy, which she ran her hand over.

She then squatted with her legs spread, giving him a good look at her shaved pussy as she pulled back on a garter that was around her left thigh. The guy put a couple of bucks in there and she then moved towards the next one. She worked her way around the stage as far as she could during what turned out to be her last song. When it ended the DJ called for the next dancer and the brunette gathered up her stuff and put her G-string and flashy top back on. She also put a light, gauzy jacket on.

When she left the stage she headed out into the crowd and seemed to be asking about table dances. The first two tables of guys said no, but when she looked our way, I made eye contact and gave her a little come to us move with my left hand. She grinned and scampered over, well as much as a woman can scamper in those ridiculously high stripper heels.

When she got to us, she just walked up and sat on my lap. I asked her name and she said Jasmine. Typical fake name. She asked about the two of us. I just grinned and told her I wanted her to give Violet a table dance. She said it was $20 so I pulled it out. Violet couldn't hear us over the music, but we both smiled at her and talked until the song ended. I ran my hands over her hip and ass while she was sitting there. Her skin was very smooth. I could also tell that she was very young.

When the song was ending, Jasmine got up and went over to Violet. She removed her gauzy top and put it on the other chair at the table. She approached Violet and pushed her legs apart as the song started. Violet looked over at me and mouthed thank you.

Jasmine proceeded to give Violet a table dance. First she rubbed up against her and slowly slid down her body, making sure to drag herself across Violet's tits and the rest of her. Then she turned around and sat on Violet's lap, between her legs, and leaned back. They said something to each other and Jasmine glanced my way. Then she stood up and removed her bra-like top. She rubbed up against Violet, who tried to capture a nipple in her mouth. Jasmine jerked away with a grin and shook her finger at Violet. She leaned over and said something to her, probably explaining what the no-touching rule was. Then she pointed over to where the private dance area was and they talked.

After that, Jasmine kept rubbing her tits against Violet's body, up and down. When the song ended, Violet leaned over toward me to talk loud enough for us to hear. ""I don't want to wait to check out any other girls. I want to take this one in the back.""

""Okay. What's the deal?""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean what does it cost? What do we get? What will she do?""

""It's $250 for 30 minutes. I guess she'll dance and let us play a little.""

I waved to Jasmine and patted my lap. She sat down. I put my left hand on her hip, loving the feel of the bare skin. She was definitely a nice piece of ass.

""So what's the deal with the private area?""

""It's $250 for thirty minutes. It's completely private.""

""And what are we going to do back there.""

She grinned. ""Well, I really like your wife."" She reached down and grabbed my left hand and pointed to the ring. ""So I think maybe we can play a little.""

""You're going to have to be more specific. Will you eat her pussy? Will you suck my cock? What?""

Jasmine looked at me closely and grinned. ""Well, I think I'd love to play with your wife. Will she eat my pussy?""

""Of course. She loves pussy. What about me?""

""We can play, too. I have a condom to make sure you and I can play.""

I looked at her. It's not like a stripper to be coy. ""You mean you'll suck me or fuck me?""

She grinned. ""Okay, you want me to say it. I usually don't out here. I like to talk in there.""

""It's too late in there. I want to make sure we know what to expect before I fork over some money.""

""Yeah, I can see that.""

""And I also want you to know that I tip well.""

Jasmine grinned. ""Then let's go. I'll suck and fuck you and let your wife eat my pussy."" She started to get up and then stopped for a second. ""It will be best if you tip the guy out front who leads us to the room, too.""

I motioned to Violet and we all stood up and headed for the private area. She joined hands with both of us and led us back to the beginning of the private area. She spoke to the monitor who nodded. He led us back to a long hallway that had small rooms on either side with couches. The hallway was painted dark, grey or black. The small rooms were also dark grey or black. The curtains were definitely grey and the couches a dark brown.

He showed us to one of the larger ones with full couches and curtains in front. I turned and handed him a $20 and he nodded thanks. We moved into the room and he turned to pull the curtains closed. He said to Jasmine, ""30 minutes"".

The music was more subdued in here and we could actually hear enough to talk to each other. Violet sat down on the one side of the couch and I on her left as we were sitting. Jasmine smiled at us and took off all but her G-string and heels. She turned to Violet first and grinned. ""Do you and your husband do this often?""

Violet looked at me and grinned. ""He's not my husband. He and I are married, but not to each other. We're just fuck buddies.""

Jasmine looked back and forth between us, questions appearing to her as she looked at us, but she said nothing. She just shrugged and turned to Violet. She pushed Violet's legs apart and started dancing. She leaned against her and slowly slipped down Violet's front until she was on her knees between Violet's legs. She reached up and ran her hand over Violet's tits. Violet immediately put her hands on the straps of her dress and pulled them down over her shoulders. Jasmine grinned and helped Violet pull her dress down over her tits, leaving the large, beautiful mounds exposed to both of us. Jasmine leaned forward slowly and Violet put her hands on Jasmine's head, guiding her to the nipple of her right tit. Jasmine sucked and Violet let out a deep sigh. I leaned over and sucked on her left.

Violet put one hand on each of our heads and just enjoyed our sucking. I put my hand on her thigh and ran it up as far as I could to, dragging her dress with it. Jasmine turned to me and grinned. We pulled back and she grabbed Violet by her legs just above the knees and pulled. Violet understood what she was doing and lifted up, sliding down into a slouch against the couch. This also had the effect of sliding her dress up further.

Jasmine looked up at Violet, who was staring down at her, and slowly ran a single finger up her slit and over her clit. Violet just leaned back and moaned.

I leaned forward closer to Jasmine. ""She's a horny little bitch who will do anything once you get her motor running.""

Jasmine grinned. ""Me, too.""

I smiled at that. ""Then let's do this.""

Jasmine then stood and kicked off her shoes and pulled her G-string off. She leaned over to me. ""Get your cock out.""

That sounded easier than it was. I didn't want to take my pants off, but I had to open them up and slide them down a little so my cock would be free enough to be available. When I got it out and it reached to the sky, it was already nice and hard.

Jasmine was now running two fingers into Violet while she sucked on a nipple. When I sat back down with my cock sticking up, she pulled off Violet's tit and looked at my cock. ""Oh, good, a nice cock. The last guy had barely four inches.""

""Yeah, but he paid to get off and he did, right?""

""Oh, yeah. My customers never leave unhappy.""

Jasmine stopped what she was doing to Violet and turned to her small purse. She opened it and extracted a condom. She pulled it out and turned to me. ""I'll put it on.""

She grabbed my cock by the base and positioned the condom over the top. I had heard that there were women who would take the condom into their mouths and put it on by running their mouth down your cock. But Jasmine didn't do that. She used the conventional method. When she got it on, she grinned up at me. ""It's very hard. I like them very hard.""

I smiled, not really knowing if that was the truth or she was just playing to me to get me off and get a decent tip. Anyway, she then abandoned my cock and leaned over to whisper something in Violet's ear. Violet looked at me with a funny grin and nodded. Jasmine came over to me and knelt between my legs. She grabbed my cock and started blowing me.

I'm not sure how it must feel to the woman to blow a guy wearing a condom, but it felt very strange to me, even though the condom was very thin. Violet knelt next to me and lifted a tit to my lips. I suckled and just reveled in the action I was getting for a couple of minutes. I pulled back and looked up at Violet.

""You enjoying this?""

She grinned a funny grin again. ""Yes, but it will get much better.""

""Yeah? Better than having a women with great big tits feed them to me while another woman blows me?""

""Oh, yes."" She giggled and patted Jasmine on the shoulder. Jasmine grinned and stood up. So did Violet.

Now what?

Well, the girls got into a great position. Jasmine turned around and sat on my lap, her back to me, trapping my cock against my stomach. Violet moved around in front of the two of us and knelt between Jasmine's legs. Jasmine leaned back against me and put her head on my shoulder. We both watched as Violet moved to eat her pussy. Violet didn't waste time and immediately started eating Jasmine's pussy. Jasmine moaned.

Jasmine then turned to me. ""I'm now going to sit on your cock and Violet is going to eat my pussy. Ready?""

""Always!""

Jasmine leaned forward and Violet sat back. Jasmine lifted herself up and lined her pussy up with my cock. She slowly worked it into her pussy and finally got all the way down. She sat with her back straight up and started slowly moving on my cock. She said something to Violet that I didn't hear, but suddenly she moaned and started jerking back and forth as I figured Violet made contact with her pussy.

I then felt Violet's tongue on my balls. Jasmine turned toward me. ""You're right. She is a horny bitch, isn't she?""

""Yes, she is.""

Violet licked and sucked on my balls and Jasmine's pussy for a few minutes, then stood up. Jasmine leaned forward and starting sucking on her left nipple. Violet had a sharp intake of breath and then pulled away. ""I need to get fucked. Lay down Jasmine so that I can eat your pussy while John fucks me.""

Jasmine slowly pushed up off my cock. She moaned. ""I was just getting into it. I don't normally get too excited with all the traffic I see in here, but you two had me getting there.""

Violet helped her up and then grabbed both her nipples. ""Relax, you stripper slut. I'll work on getting you off while John fucks me. I really need him to fuck me."" I stood up to make room.

Jasmine lay back against one arm of the couch, her right knee on the couch and her left foot on the floor, and Violet knelt between her legs. Violet lifted her ass up in the air as she dove into Jasmine's pussy.

I had a great target and I figured I would leave the condom on, in case I got another chance at Jasmine. I moved forward and slid into the hot pussy of Violet. Her hips are perfectly sized for looking good and for grabbing onto as you fuck her. I grabbed them and started fucking her with gusto. Once she gets going, she loves to cum.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

I was fucking her hard, my cock making squishing sounds and my hips slapping up against her ass. She was doing a good job on Jasmine, too. Jasmine was squirming under Violet's attention to her pussy.

I was thrusting hard when suddenly Jasmine looked directly at me and her eyes got big. She put her hand on Violet's head and pulled it tighter to her pussy. She then slowly closed her eyes and started jerking, her body going through spasms and her legs tightening on Violet's head. She had a major orgasm.

I had slowed to allow Violet to finish off Jasmine and now, after making Jasmine cum, Violet moved forward, dislodging my cock. She stood up and turned to me.

""Sit down!""

I immediately sat. I figured Violet wanted to get off. I was wrong.

Violet knelt between my legs and reached up to grab my cock. Jasmine sat up beside me as Violet then pulled the condom of my cock.

I turned toward Jasmine. ""You looked like you enjoyed that.""

Jasmine grinned. ""I rarely get to cum with anyone back here, but she was good and the idea that I had two married folks who were fuck buddies doing that really got to me."" She reached down and put her hand on Violet's head as Violet leaned over to start sucking my cock. ""You two are nice and uninhibited. I really enjoy that.""

Then Jasmine just assisted Violet as she started sucking my cock. Violet started by licking and slurping, but I didn't need any help getting there. I was close from all of this activity. Jasmine leaned close to me. She watched as Violet was sucking my cock.

Jasmine started talking, probably figuring that it would help me get off. She was right. ""Look at that slut suck your cock. Show us your wedding ring on his cock while you suck it."" Violet did, but didn't let up. ""Suck that cock you married slut. Get that cum. I can tell that he is going to fill up that dirty mouth of yours."" She turned back to me. ""Go ahead and cum in her mouth. She is a cum-guzzling, sex-loving, married woman in a strip club sucking off a man who is not her husband after eating the pussy of a nasty, little stripper."" Jasmine looked at me. ""Oh yeah, you're close. Cum in that mouth. Do it. I want to see you jerk as she sucks on that big, fucking cock.""

That was all it took. I put my left hand on Violet's head and had a big spasm as all my muscles contracted and I spurted into her mouth. Violet kept sucking as I jerked and spurted several times into her mouth. I finally stopped and she finished getting all she could and came up off my cock with a pop.

""Yum. You should try some of this cum, Jasmine. He tastes good for man cum.""

Jasmine smiled. ""Maybe next time.""

I looked at my watch. ""It's been 25 minutes. I guess we'd better get straightened up.""

We put ourselves back together and prepared to leave. Violet then asked Jasmine about something and I saw them exchange phone numbers. Then we left.

As we headed down the hallway, I reached into my pocket and grabbed another $50. I turned to Jasmine.

""It was quite a pleasure, Jasmine. Here's a little tip.""

""Thank you."" She pressed that $50 into her little purse with a bunch of other wadded up bills. ""I can go easy the rest of the night."" She leaned up and kissed me on the cheek. ""Hope to see you again.""

She then kissed Violet on the lips briefly and headed toward the stripper dressing room.

Violet and I left and when we got outside Violet gave out a little whoop. ""That was outstanding! I've never been in a strip club before and now I have and we had sex with a stripper and I sucked you off in one of their little dance rooms.""

I grinned. ""Okay, calm down. You keep that up and I'll get another boner.""

Violet grinned. ""And that's a bad thing?""

We got in the car and drove home. I didn't say anything about her getting Jasmine's phone number, but I was hoping that I might see her again.

When I got home, Violet left and I went inside. Ann demanded to see some pics, but I told her that cell phone pics were not allowed in strip clubs. She pouted for a few minutes and then dragged me upstairs.

She tore my pants off and started sucking my cock. She looked up at me. ""I don't really taste any pussy on there. What the fuck?""

I explained about the condom and she grinned. We had sex anyway, but I could tell she really wanted some kind of proof about everything.

Over the next couple of weeks, things calmed down, but every once in a while I would come home and find Ann horny as hell. She was usually watching one of the movies she had of me, but I could tell that each time she did, she needed a little more boost.

I came home one Friday and found the kids gone and Ann sitting on the couch in nothing but a sexy bra and panty set. She grinned and me and hooked her finger in the come hither movement. I grinned back and advanced on her. She was still breathtaking in my eyes and she had me excited immediately.

I got to her and she rose to kiss and hug me, but before I could too far, she pushed me back. ""Just a minute, buster. You have to earn your time with me tonight.""

I looked at her quizzically. ""What do you mean?""

She pointed to the couch. ""Sit down here and all will be revealed, so to speak.""

I sat and Ann grinned again and waved to someone behind me. I turned to look and there, advancing on me from the kitchen were Violet and Jasmine. My cock twitched.

Ann pulled all her clothes off as she instructed us all to reenact our strip club encounter. She then pulled out the hand held movie camera and turned it on. She reached over and turned on some music.

So we started doing that, except this time without a condom. Jasmine danced and played with Violet in the same manner as she did before. Then she told me to get my cock out and I did. Then she sat on my cock as Jasmine licked us. We were proceeding just as before and Ann was zooming in and out and moving around to get all the angles. Then Jasmine got off me and we got into the position where Violet was eating Jasmine and I was fucking Violet from behind.

Jasmine had an orgasm more easily this time and I was lasting pretty well. When we got to the part where Violet was blowing me and Jasmine was up against my side, Ann got more involved. She moved closer and started doing the talking.

""Did you tell Don that you went to a strip joint and picked up a common stripper to fuck?"" She grabbed the back of Violet's head. ""C'mon now. You've been eating a stripper's pussy and now I want you to properly suck my husband's cock. Do it, you slut! I'm filming this to show your husband what a fucking slut you are."" Violet kept sucking and moving her eyes amongst the three of us, when possible.

Ann kept berating her. ""Look at how you suck that cock. C'mon, honey, give her what she wants. She wants your cock spurting into her cheating, cock-sucking mouth.""

I kept thrusting up into Violet's mouth and holding Jasmine's ass as she was snuggled up against me.

""C'mon John, give this slut what she wants. Let's show her husband what a fucking whore she really is. Fill her mouth with cum. I want to see her swallow your seed while the slutty stripper watches.""

I was getting close now. I had three naked women around me and one was sucking my cock really well.

""Oh, yeah. I'm going to cum and fill her slutty belly up with cum.""

""Stand up!"" Ann yelled.

We were all momentarily stunned, but then I stood up.

Ann directed us. ""John, stand with one foot on the floor and one on the couch. Spread your legs."" I did that, my hard cock swinging back and forth. ""Violet, you slut, get on your knees and suck his cock. Jasmine, get behind Violet and finger fuck her pussy.""

Violet started sucking my cock and Jasmine grinned as she started fingering Violet.

""Now suck that cock you big-tit cock-slut. I want to see you pull that cum out of my husband's balls like a good cock-sucker and swallow it all.""

Violet was bobbing on my cock and I felt Ann get on the floor behind me. I looked at her and she was laying down with the camera aimed up at where Violet was sucking me.

""C'mon, honey, giver her that cum. I want to see how your balls and cock pulse and shoot it deep into her throat.""

I felt it coming. ""Oh, yeah. I'm going to cum in this fucking slut's mouth.""

""Do it!"" Ann was excited now. ""Show Don what a cum-guzzling slut she is.""

""Fuck!"" I started spurting. Violet started sucking and swallowing and bobbing to get me off as Jasmine put hands on my hips to stop them from moving. ""Oh, fuck!"" I just kept cumming and cumming, filling Violet's sweet sucking mouth with my seed.

""Swallow that load, you slut!"" Ann was still filming from below. ""I can see his balls and cock pulse as the spurt into your cheating, slut mouth. And I can see you swallowing as fast as you can to keep up with all that cum. My husband cums a lot more than yours, so make sure you don't spill any.""

I finally stopped cumming and Violet seemed to suck a little longer and then let up on my sensitive cock. She pulled back and grinned up at me. ""Nice load, John.""

Ann stood up and came around to my front. The video was still rolling. ""Show me your mouth, slut.""

Violet opened her mouth, showing it was empty, and then closed it, grinning.

""Tell your husband what a cum slut you are.""

Violet looked directly into the camera. ""Don, I have become a real cum slut. I always enjoyed sucking your cock, but now I crave the variety of cocks that I can have."" She turned toward me. ""And I really like sucking John's cock. His cum is delicious.""

Ann grinned and then panned over to Jasmine, who was sitting on the floor in front of the couch. ""Tell me, Jasmine, is she good at eating pussy, too?""

Jasmine smiled for the camera and nodded. ""She is very good at eating pussy. I think she's just a fucking nympho for any sex.""

""Thank you."" Ann turned the camera back to me, where I had sat down on the couch. ""Violet, get that last bit of cum seeping out of my husband's cock.""

Violet did, then smacked her lips. ""Yum.""

Ann shut off the camera and put it down. ""Nice job, John, Jasmine, and Slut."" She patted Violet on the head like a pet. ""Now get dressed and get your sleazy asses out of my house."" Ann said it with a grin.

Jasmine and Violet got dressed and we discussed the sex until they left. I noticed that Ann was not around and when I went upstairs I got hard again. Ann was lying on the bed with the video playing on the TV while she buried a dildo in her pussy. I walked over, turned her to the side so she could still see the TV and removed the dildo. I fucked her hard until we both came.",,2025-08-15T19:13:08.411938,3813,3.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/chivalry-is-on-life-support-ch-43,Chivalry is on Life Support Ch. 43,Unknown Author,,,,,"I set the alarm app on my iPhone for 6:30 AM Saturday morning so Brooke and I could get an early start. We had a lot of prepping and cooking to do in order to be ready to serve as many as twelve guests later that day: hors d'oeuvres and cocktails were scheduled for 6 PM and dinner was to be served at 7:30.

However, we were awoken not by the obnoxious ringing noise on my phone at 6 AM, but rather by repeated rings of our doorbell an hour earlier. I was lying next to Brooke in bed, startled out of a deep sleep by the insistent sound. Brooke was a deeper sleeper than I was, so I was the first one to get up out of bed. As was typical, I was sleeping in an old T-shirt and a pair of panties, so I quickly put on my bathrobe and hurried downstairs to answer the door. It was still completely dark outside. Standing on our porch was Luke's brother, Kevin.

""Took you long enough,"" he said, rudely.

""Hi, Kevin,"" I replied, drowsily. ""I'm sorry. We weren't expecting you. Did you tell one of us you planned on coming by this morning?""

Behind me, I heard Brooke say, ""Who's there, Walter?""

""It's okay, darling. It's just Kevin""

""'Just Kevin.' I'm not sure that's a smart way to talk about your new boss, Wally. I sure hope you've been studying up on those DIY plumbing videos on YouTube, like I told you to in December,"" Kevin said, walking boldly past me into our house.

""You've gotta be kidding me,"" said Brooke, sleepy and annoyed. She was too groggy to be polite. I'm fairly certain that had she been alert, she would've been more careful in her choice of words and in her attitude.

""Nice to see you, too, Brooke. Also not a very respectful way to talk to your future babysitter. That's okay, there'll be plenty of time to teach you both to mind your manners later. I'm here to drop off Luke's stuff. Put some clothes on Wally, and help me bring in the boxes. They're in back of my truck.""

""Sure, Kevin. I'll be right back,"" I said, turning to go upstairs to change.

Kevin interrupted me, ""You're going to have to get back into the habit of calling me 'sir', son. Since I'm going to be both your boss and your babysitter from now on,"" the brash teenager said to me, chuckling.

""This is ridiculous. Walter is not your son, Kevin,"" said Brooke.

It was, indeed, completely ridiculous for an 18-year-old plumber to be calling a 40-year-old literature professor ""son."" Nevertheless, Kevin was in the midst of his ""I told you so"" visit, clearly in a position of power now. Though we then had no idea of the depth and extent of it, Brooke and I were in a position of weakness, what was to become our new normal. It certainly was not a good idea to antagonize him.

""Be careful, Brooke,"" I warned.

""You better listen to your little hubbie, Brooke, if you know what's good for you. You're going to be calling me 'sir' soon enough yourself,"" Kevin said, with an arrogant smirk very similar to that of his big brother.

Brooke glared at him, but at least didn't say anything else to challenge him.

As I started to go back up the stairs, Kevin interrupted me, ""Wait a minute, son. What are you wearing under that robe? Turn around and take it off.""

""Um...yes, sir,"" I said, reluctantly removing my robe. I saw Brooke roll her eyes.

Brooke had told me that she planned to lock me back in my chastity cage that afternoon before we went over to Luke's house. But at that moment, I was still free. Like many men, I nearly always woke up with a hard-on -- the morning wood, I believe it is called -- and I was probably harder than on most mornings given this humiliating encounter with Kevin (the usual collusion between my treacherous cock and my submissive brain). He stared down at my cock, tenting out my panties.

""Ha ha. Just like I thought. You're pathetic, Wally. It's no wonder why Brooke begged Luke to start banging her again. She needs a real man's cock, not your pansy pin dick. You too, Brooke. Let's see what -- If anything, ha ha -- you've got on under your robe.""

Brooke continued to regard Kevin with a death glare, but, while she didn't completely remove her robe as I had, she did open it up momentarily, giving him a glimpse of her body, naked except for her panties. Whereas I had on a fuller pair of navy blue boyshorts panties (trying to hide from Brooke the lingering effects of Paul's strapping, as my ass was still quite red when we went to bed last night), Brooke was wearing a pair of maroon, cheeky panties (quite skimpy). Her nipples were rock hard, a fact which did not escape Kevin's attention. We both saw him look directly at her breasts and smile, before she closed her robe.

""You must be cold, Brooke. Or, maybe, you're actually hot. Ha ha. It is pretty warm in here. You two really should start wearing matching panties. Get your ass upstairs and get dressed, Wally. My first job is across town in 45 minutes. I don't have all fucking day. How about a cup of coffee, Brooke?"" he said, more an order than a request.

""I was just about to make some anyhow,"" Brooke said, testily, before walking towards the kitchen. I ran upstairs and slipped on a pair of sweatpants.

Probably because he was in a hurry, Kevin helped me bring the boxes into the house. However, he didn't help to bring them upstairs into the bedroom (still more work for me and Brooke to do later). There seemed to be about a third fewer boxes than he took away in December.

As if reading my my mind, he said to me as we carried in a particularly heavy one together (no doubt, containing some of Luke's extensive footwear collection), ""You probably notice that there's not as many boxes now. That's because Luke wants you and Brooke spending more time at his house, especially when it's warmer out. I can't wait. I'm sick of this shitty, cold weather."" It was 22 degrees that late February day, and I shared Kevin's fatigue with the cold weather.

After we finished with the boxes, Kevin walked into the kitchen and said to Brooke, ""Put my coffee in a thermos or something. I've got to get going.""

Eager to be rid of him, Brooke filled up one of our Hydro Flasks with coffee and asked, ""Do you take milk or sugar?""

""Now that's more like it. Milk, two teaspoons of sugar. Both of you will know all of my and Kaylee's preferences real well before long. Which reminds me, Luke wanted me to tell you both to be at his house by noon.""

As Brooke poured the milk into the Hydro Flask, she said, ""He said the guests will start arriving at 6 PM. We won't need anywhere near that long to get ready. We weren't planning on getting there until 3.""

""Change of plans,"" Kevin said with another smirk. ""Luke's cleaning lady called in sick yesterday, so he wants you there early to give the place a good cleaning, especially the bathrooms and the kitchen. He said you should bring another set of clothes to clean in and then you can take a shower afterwards before you change into what you're gonna wear when you serve everyone snacks and dinner.""

""Great,"" said Brooke.

""You don't sound that happy, Brooke,"" Kevin said, smirk intact.

""It's just a lot of work, is all. Tell Luke we'll be there. Thanks for bringing his stuff,"" Brooke said.

""Good girl,"" Kevin replied, as he took his coffee and walked out of the side door that led to our driveway. ""Don't worry, we'll be seeing a lot more of each other real soon,"" he added with a wink, before the door closed behind him.

""Good morning, darling,"" I said with a smile, trying to make light of Kevin's most unpleasant, surprise visit.

""I hate that bratty, fucking little snitch. He makes my skin crawl,"" Brooke said.

""Mine, too. Unfortunately, he's part of the package with Luke.""

""Yes, Kevin and apparently his skanky girlfriend, Kaylee, too. Not to mention Luke's cunt of a girlfriend, whatever her name is. I guess we're going to be everyone's little bitches.""

""We'll find out her name soon enough, I guess. Do you think she'll be there tonight? You know, as his date for the dinner?"" I asked, with trepidation. I hesitated to bring up this subject with Brooke, but it was certainly weighing on my mind. I knew meeting Luke's girlfriend was going to be incredibly difficult for her.

""No, I asked him point-blank and he said that she's traveling. Thank god for small favors, at least. Tonight's going to be humiliating enough as it is without me having to meet this bitch on top of it.""

""Do you think his leadership team will know who we are? Maybe they'll just assume we're the caterers?""

""Are you kidding? Of course, they'll know exactly who we are. I told you about Luke's reputation -- how he publicly cuckolded and totally emasculated his first boss. And how he's done that with several others since, including other co-workers and employees of his. Maybe not to the same extent as his old boss. But he's slept with their wives and rubbed their noses in it. This is his brand, Walter: big swingin dick, Luke Hanover. He revels in it. You can be quite certain that everyone there is going to know that his ex-wife and her English professor husband are the ones waiting on them all like Luke's little lackeys. Luke will be in all his glory tonight, and having us there as his servants will be icing on the cake.""

""Well maybe people will think that we have a catering business on the side?"" I ventured.

""Yeah, and maybe they'll also think we're from outer space. Get real.""

""Ok, I get it. It's going to be humiliating. Are you really sure you're up for all of this, Brooke?"" I asked.

She looked me in the eyes and touched my arm. ""Walter, I know you mean well, but you have to stop asking me that. This is the price I have to pay to have Luke back. I'm going in with eyes wide open. That doesn't mean that I'm always going to be happy about what's going on or that I'm not going to complain about it. Sometimes, I'm probably even going to cry about it or rage about it. But that doesn't change fact that I'm all in, 100%, for this next crazy chapter in our lives. Come what may.""

""The newest twist in the game,"" I said.

""That's right. But what about you, my loyal knight? I'm the one who should be asking you: are you sure YOU'RE up for all this? Especially tonight, being a waiter for all of these corporate blowhards? I know the type well. I mean, I wait on these types of people all the time at the restaurant. I've been a waitress for a long time now, so I'm used to the humiliations service workers are routinely subjected to -- although, admittedly, it's going to be on a whole different level tonight. But you're not. It's a lot different being in charge of a classroom than being a waiter or a waitress.""

Brooke, of course, did not know about the all of humiliation I suffered after I lost control of my class last year following the Ren fair. She did not know that I was now under the control of a few of my former students, compelled each week to cook for them, and to serve as serve as their maid. She was not aware that I had become the coffee boy and foot masseuse of my fellow professor and friend. All of the above, byproducts of Luke's domination, of course. Except for those few occasions that Brooke was present when I was humiliated in front of a wider group of people -- such as when I served as a waiter when Neil and Laura came over for dinner, or when she and I cheered Luke on at his football games, or at the Ren faire itself -- she was really only aware of my submission to her, and to Luke, of course. Still, she certainly knew that I was no stranger to humiliation.

However, I had a strong suspicion that the impending humiliation we were facing with Luke's return was going to be far more challenging for Brooke to endure than for me -- that, in fact, it was going to be far more challenging for her to endure than she realized. Because, whereas I am fundamentally a beta, Brooke is fundamentally an alpha. I can hear some of those reading this say, ""Yeah, sure. She's an alpha just like she's a feminist -- allowing Luke to dominate her and degrade her in the sack. She's a real alpha, all right."" But, as I have explained before, Brooke is turned on by being sexually dominated and degraded by a certain type of alpha male -- in fact, it seems as though Luke is the only one who truly fits that bill for her (so far, at least). And even with Luke, she long resisted submitting to him outside of the bedroom; that's why she divorced him in the first place. She was now agreeing to this new, broader level of submission because she has accepted the fact that she is sexually addicted to him -- and, realizing the intensity of her addiction, Luke set these conditions for her to continue to have access to her drug. It is either submit or do without the drug. As we have seen, the withdrawal pains for her were not sustainable.

But in virtually every other aspect of her life, Brooke is generally the one in control. She is obviously completely in control of me. Even at the restaurant, although a waitress, she is generally looked up to by the younger waitresses such as Laura and even by the more seasoned waitstaff and other restaurant staff. Her bosses (even her sexist manager) know that she possesses intellectual capability well beyond her job, and respect her competence, judgement and work ethic. And, over the years, there have been many lecherous male patrons of the restaurant, and rude customers of both sexes, who have been put in their place by Brooke. In her friendships, too -- such as with Laura and her estranged friend Michelle -- Brooke is the one who is generally deferred to. She is confident, strong willed, a natural leader. She is also fiercely competitive, someone who likes to win (whether a tennis match, a board game, or an argument) and who usually does. For those who can't see how it is possible for someone to have an alpha personality and also be sexually submissive -- to be, in essence, a feminist but still allow herself to be sexually degraded -- I'm sorry for you that you see things only in black and white, and are incapable of understanding how two opposing things can be true at the same time.

As Brooke's devoted knight (her chivalrous cuckold, as Anna put it), it was my job -- indeed, my sacred duty -- to stand by her side during what I knew would be an incredibly trying period for her. It was my job to console her if she wanted to cry on my shoulder, to be her punching bag if she needed someone to take her frustrations out on, to absorb as much of the humiliation directed her way as possible so as to lighten her burden. Why, you may ask? Because that's what knights do for their ladies, that's why. Because I love her more than I have ever loved anyone, or anything, in my life.

So I answered her question by dropping to my knees, and saying to her, ""I would gladly suffer any and all humiliations for you, my lady."" I then removed her slipper and reverently kissed her bare right foot. I was completely serious, but levity also has its place at times like these. So, I next looked up at her and smiled, ""When we get to Luke's, I'm going to say to him, 'Little bitch Walter reporting for duty, sir!'""

Brooke looked down on me, grabbed my head with her hands and pulled me towards her body. She smiled somewhat sadly and said, ""I love you. You're really too good for me, you know that?"" And then she smiled more fully and said, ""And I'll stand right beside you and say to him: ""Little bitch Brooke reporting for duty, sir!""

I stood up and said, laughing, ""Use and abuse to your heart's content, sir!""

Still smiling, now more wistfully, she said, ""He really will, you know. But maybe after the dinner party, he'll use and abuse us in a good way, at least. Well, I guess we'd better get to work.""

""Wait, if Luke isn't bringing anyone to his dinner, we'll only have eleven people to feed,"" I said.

""That's right. Good.""

""I bought enough for twelve portions.""

""That's okay. Maybe he'll allow the help eat the leftovers,"" she laughed. ""It IS going to be a pretty awesome meal.""

""It's certainly going to be an expensive meal. Do you think he'll reimburse us for all the groceries?""

""He said he would. Just not for our slave labor, obviously.""

""Obviously,"" I said.

An hour before we left for Luke's, Brooke locked me back in my chastity cage.

""Your little cock has been free for so long, at least for the most part. But you're all out of get of jail free cards now, I'm afraid,"" she said, smiling, as she pulled my panties down with one hand and held my cage with the other. I got immediately hard.

""Oh my, I think it's excited to be locked up again. Go get a bag of ice.""

After she iced me down she was able to get the cage over my momentarily flaccid cock and pulled my balls through the base ring. I had just gotten a full body waxing two days earlier, so my cock and balls were completely hairless. As soon as I was locked up, my cock started to inflate again, pushing up against the cold metal rings of the DOMINIX Deluxe chastity cage Brooke had bought me for Christmas.

""I think it likes its new prison. I'm going to keep one key on my anklet and give the other one to Luke, of course. That way, he'll have a key to both of your cock cages.""

""Of course. I just wish you could wait till after dinner to put it on me. Those pants that he wants me to wear are so tight, I'm afraid everyone will be able to see the bulk beneath them.""

""I doubt it. Your black waiter pants will hide it a lot better than yoga pants at least; I'm surprised he's not making you wear those. Too informal, I suppose. Besides, maybe Luke will let you wear the apron Michelle bought you last year. It''s effeminate, but at least it will hide any bulk. I really like the looks of this chastity cage -- the curve, the rings. Look how shiny it is!"" she said as she flicked my cage with her finger nail. ""Now you really are my knight in shining armor.""

""I don't really feel prepared to go to battle in this armor, my lady. I feel very...very weak.""

""Your weakness is your strength, my knight.""

""If that's really true, I'm invincible,"" I said, with a slight laugh.

Luke greeted us at the door when we got to his house at 12 noon sharp. Brooke and I were dressed in sweatpants and T-shirts, ready to clean, and brought our serving uniforms along in a bag. We had also brought along several bags and trays of food, a mixture of hors d'oeuvres and dishes we had already prepared that just need to be heated up, and the ingredients to make several more dishes.

""Good. You're on time. My cleaning lady -- ex cleaning lady, I should say -- called in sick yesterday. Seems like she's always calling in sick, but for her to do it right before my big dinner really pisses me off. She's done. You'll find all the cleaning supplies in the basement. I want this place to really sparkle tonight,"" Luke said, by way of greeting.

""No kiss or anything?"" Brooke said to him, with a faint smile.

""There's no time for that now. Do a great job tonight -- which you'd better -- and there might be a reward later. But, for now, you two have way too much work to do to be worried about anything other than getting it done. I left some things for you to wear tonight on the kitchen table.""

""We brought what we're wearing with us. Just what you told us to bring. I'm wearing my waitress uniform and Walter's wearing exactly what he did the first time he cooked you dinner,"" Brooke said.

""Good. Yes, that's what I told you to do, but I got you a couple of little things to add or substitute. I told you how important this dinner is to me. Remember, I just hired my CMO -- that's chief marketing officer, prof -- as the last member of my executive team. So, my CMO is the guest of honor. But this is really a celebration of the fact that I've finally got my whole leadership team in place. I expect you both to address everyone as sir and ma'am throughout the evening. Every time you take a drink order. Every time you offer them something to eat. Every time you interact with them in any way. Treat them all with respect, especially the guest of honor. Got it?""",,2025-08-15T19:13:44.462591,3710,

Joel was in a bad way. He'd vomited twice now. The first time was moments after dashing off the tube. He'd run to the corner of the platform and blown chunks of hot bile all over the concrete. He'd been embarrassed at first; but moments later realised that everyone in London was in too much of a hurry to notice or care even if they did. He was shaky and chilled, shuddering and teeth chattering. Delirious, he'd made his way above ground with the intent of finding his way home. He'd found his way to a park bench when his stomach turned again and he heaved into a rubbish bin.

He sat there still, wondering how to get home. His work as an estate agent rep had brought him almost all the way across London for a viewing. Home was a considerable distance away and he would need a few more changes on the tube over the course of probably an hour before making it back. In his current state he doubted he would last the journey without vomiting again. So the tube was no longer an option. Nor was a cab or an Uber. He took out his phone and googled the nearest hospital. Nothing close.

What the fuck was wrong with him? He couldn't even remember the last time he'd been ill. Something he ate maybe? Nothing weird recently came to mind. Looking at his phone he saw that he'd not vomited for twenty minutes. Progress he supposed, but it didn't feel that way. He risked five minutes in a nearby Tesco express and bought a bottle of water then went back to the bench, just because he couldn't think what else to do. He sat for a few moments and then his phone pinged.

Emily: Hey babe. Thinking about you. Miss your cock.

Joel: Awful morning. Threw up on the tube.

E: Oh no! Hunny! What's wrong?

J: Dunno. Just feel terrible. Keep feeling sick.

E: Where are you?

J: Watford somewhere.

E: Can you get home?

J: Too rough to get back on train.

E: Hang on a sec.

A few minutes passed. Joel finished off the bottle of water and wrapped his arms tight around the suit jacket to try and keep the shivers at bay. After what felt like an eternity, the phone pinged again. Another text from Emily. An address.

E: Do you think you can make it here?

He copied the address into google maps. Ten minute walk. All things considered, it was his best option.

Carrie hurried around her bedroom tidying up a few loose ends: all dirty laundry in the hamper and out of sight and shoes and coats back in the wardrobe. She gave the bed sheets a little straighten and thought herself lucky for taking the initiative to change them earlier that morning. Then she gave herself a quick spray on the wrists with perfume. She was about to walk back to the small office she had setup in her guest bedroom when the doorbell rang finally. Pressing the intercom she said, ""Hello?""

""Hi, this is Joel? Emily said to come here,"" came the voice over the line. It was feeble sounding and shaken.

""Yes, Hi, Joel! Come on up,"" she said and buzzed him in.

A few moments later she was opening the front door to her flat and welcoming him in. Before him stood a late twenties looking black woman with large curly dark hair as wide as her shoulders with a streak of electric blue at the front. She was tall-a couple of inches bigger than his average 5'10"" frame-and full figured. She wore white jeans that held thick thighs and a big ass and on top a pale denim shirt that showed off all of her curves and stopped just a little above the waist of the jeans; revealing just a tease of the chocolate of her belly. She wore thick rimmed glasses that gave her a professional look and a smile that was all brilliant white teeth, friendly and welcoming. If he wasn't feeling so rough he'd take more time to think about the fact that she was gorgeous.

""Hi, I'm really sorry about this,"" he began.

Carrie looked him over and was surprised. His otherwise well cropped hair was messy from stress and he wore a decent black business suit with vomit stains on the shirt. He was pale and sweaty and wore a pained expression. She thought how he'd be well turned out if it wasn't for his unfortunate state.

""No, it's fine. Emily said you're not well. Come through, you can have a lie down.""

She led him into the bedroom. It only took a few seconds but long enough to think how it had been a while since she'd brought a man into this room, for any reason. This man had been in her home less than a minute and here she was giving him access to the most sacred of any woman's spaces. Once in the room Joel immediately noticed a door to the side.

""Is that a bathroom?"" he asked hopefully.

Carrie answered in the affirmative and without another word Joel rushed through the door and closed it behind him. She heard a tap start running and the toilet seat slam against the cistern. She tapped on the door.

""So, listen, Joel...I have a few meetings, so I'll be in the room next door for a few hours. So, like, there's a towel if you wanna shower and, just... try and get some rest, I guess. Ok?""

He gave a pained ""uh-huh"" and she left the room satisfied that she'd done as she'd promised Emily.

She went back to the office, parked herself in the chair and signed on for her zoom meetings which were due to start any minute. She had a few seconds to quickly text Emily.

C: He's here. Poor lamb, looks terribly unwell. He's in the bathroom. Told him to shower and get some rest. I've got meetings now but I'll check in on him over the next few hours. Xxx

E: Thank you so much! I'm sorry to land this on you but I can't get away today and he needed help. I know someone where he works. I'll call and let them know. Can I rely on you to take care of him?

C: Yes, of course. Happy to help.

So this was Emily's boyfriend. Rumours had gone around for a while that Emily was semi-committed to a man but Carrie herself had never seen or been told anything concrete. She didn't get to see Emily as often as she secretly wanted. They'd been sleeping together on and off since meeting a few months ago. Emily made no secret that she had many girlfriends like Carrie; a collection, she called it. Carrie had never imagined being in such a casual relationship with a woman before now. She'd started sleeping with girls after breaking up with Shaun nearly a year ago and generally found them to be less trouble than trying to keep some douchebag guy happy. But Emily was different to most girls. For one: she seemed to have a sixth sense in exactly how to pleasure Carrie physically. But more than that; there was something about the way Emily looked in her eyes that cut through to the bones of her. She felt seen, understood and soothed all at once. And all Emily asked in return was obedience: obedience between the sheets and outside. Emily wanted to own you and your body when she fucked you. She wanted to be your daddy. So far it was an arrangement that worked.

When she'd first heard that Emily was besotted with some guy, everything she knew about her made it seem unlikely. This was the woman with a cuck-husband who paid for everything but was never allowed to lay a finger on her. She enjoyed a unique sexual appeal and even an emotional hold over a handful of girls; which Carrie presumed was an addictive power. What on earth did she get from some guy?

Carrie, a graphic designer, enjoyed working from home. Her meetings today were non-eventful, yet necessary. After nearly an hour she realised Joel was showering when she heard the familiar creek of the hot water pipes. In the bathroom, Joel had spent forty odd minutes crouched by the toilet retching endlessly before deciding to shower. Carrie's shower was strong, warm and pleasurable. The warmth washed the chill away and the steam cleansed his lungs in a satisfying manner. He took the liberty of washing his hair and body with some of her many toiletries. They all smelt feminine and amazing.

When the shower was done he felt better for it, his stomach calmer than it had been in hours. He towelled off and stretched then used mouthwash to clean his mouth. He felt utterly exhausted and made sure he was as dry as possible before heading back to the bedroom. Carrie was not there. Remembering what she'd said through the door, he just climbed into bed and closed his eyes. Sleep took him in minutes.

Some time later Carrie checked in on him. She creeped into the room quietly and found him fast asleep in the bed. Watching him sleep, he seemed much more content. He'd cleaned up, his hair now clean and a little frizzy, his jawline stubbly. He was kinda cute, she thought, as she watched him. She didn't know for sure but guessed he was a little closer to her age than Emily who was in her mid-thirties. She sat beside him and heard him breathing - slow and steady. She gently placed a palm on his forehead and it didn't seem too bad. On the floor she noticed a pile of his clothes; every last stitch, down to his underwear. So, Emily's boyfriend. Naked in her bed. What a strange day this was turning out to be. She grabbed the stained shirt from his pile of clothes and left it to soak in the kitchen sink with some detergent.

Back in the office she signed in for her next meeting which she hoped would be quicker. She was able to text off screen while somebody else spoke at length.

C: Just checked on him and he's ok. Sleeping soundly, out like a light.

E: That's good news. I need to talk to you about something. I'm upset that I can't be there for him when he needs me. It's really important to me that he's taken care of properly. I need you to promise me you'll do whatever it takes to make him comfortable and happy. Whatever it takes.

Carrie was always excited when Emily told her what to do; whether it was to undress, bend over or eat her out. The last time they'd had an encounter, Emily had told her to meet her in a bar and given her exact instructions on what to wear, down to the panties which were to be omitted and gifted to her on arrival. But this was the first time an instruction had involved another person. Carrie surprised herself by finding it exciting.

C: Yes, of course

E:?

C: Yes, Emily.

The meeting was blissfully brief; after which Carrie concocted some excuse and signed off for the rest of the day, removing her glasses. In the bedroom she grabbed a few things as Joel stirred.

""How are you feeling?"" she asked gently.

He nodded silently in response with his eyes still closed to confirm that he was still alive. Carrie closed the curtains before going into the bathroom to prepare. She emerged about twenty minutes later wearing a long kimono style black silk robe which draped all the way down to her ankles. She'd done her face and hair and now looked utterly stunning. Not that Joel saw as he was rolled over away from her on his right side, presumably asleep. The robe was more for her. She felt very sexy in it; like a princess, like Cleopatra. She walked round to her dresser and replaced her stud earrings with half-moon pendants. Then she found a necklace in one of the drawers. It was a long plunge made from decorative square jewels. A gift from Emily, she remembered the night she'd given it to her as they'd sat drinking wine in the living room of this very flat.

""...from now on, you'll wear this whenever we're together,"" Emily had informed her matter of factly before sipping wine. ""Starting tonight.""

""Yes, Emily.""

Carrie looped it once around her neck so it held like a choker and allowed the rest to hang down her torso. She sprayed perfume again, over doing it deliberately. Then she stood at the foot of the bed and watched herself in a long mirrored wardrobe door as she slowly removed the robe; first parting it in the centre with a stroke of a finger then letting it fall down from her shoulders before letting it drop to the floor. She stood naked, her curved Caribbean body a collection of circles that cut a sexy silhouette. Emily had made something of a habit of having Carrie stand before her and strip slowly before they fucked. There was something sexy about how she'd made it seem ceremonial. Sacrificial almost. She performed this ritual now, despite Joel being barely conscious. Her skin goosebumped at the slightly colder air and the excitement of what was to come, her nipples tightening slightly. She walked slowly round to the side of the bed and lifted the duvet revealing Joel naked underneath. She leaned in to kiss his shoulder then crept under the duvet and lay down beside him, nestling her body in next to his little white-boy ass. He was sleep-warm and smelled of her favourite shower gel. A clean, warm, naked man ready for her in her bed. He gave a small moan as he felt her body come into contact. She spooned against his behind, reaching her left arm round to stroke his downy belly as she brought her mouth against the side of his face, her big beautiful lips smacking quietly against his cheek.

She shushed him affectionately. ""How you doing, baby?"" He responded with slight muffled moans, tired and feeble. ""I'm gonna take care of you,"" she declared softly with more shushes. She lay with him for a time, holding him close as she rocked her palm back and forth on his belly and kissed his neck tenderly. After a while he turned towards her, coming to rest on his back. Carrie wasted no time at all in pressing her body against him, the necklace caught between them. Now she brushed her fingers through his hair whilst still caressing his belly. His eyes remained closed and he muttered nonsense noises through a closed mouth. She repeated the shushing: ""I'm gonna take care of you. I'm gonna take care of you."" Barely a whisper now.

Under the duvet her hand found it's way to his cock and down to his balls which she held her palm against. He reacted with a shuffle. She shushed him again, leaning into him to kiss his chest lightly as she held his groin. Her touch was delicate, a well honed talent and she felt the blood begin to pump into his twitching cock. Her lips made there way slowly down his torso, lingering around the belly. As she kissed lightly she moved her hand from his balls to grasp his cock now that he was properly hard. The feel of it in her hand got her juices flowing and she herself let out a low grumble of a gasp in sync with Joel at the sensation. He was a normal length, which was all she looked for. Big dicks were not necessarily tender dicks and she craved tenderness. She quickly pushed back the duvet to give herself proper access to his body. Laid out in front of her he was a sexy sight - all skin and life, goosebumps and breath. She manoeuvred herself down so that she was lying on her front in between his legs. Face to face with his cock now, she was overwhelmed by the excitement it stoked inside her. Pre-cum covered the tip and his hips had begun to writhe in a fairly limp yet encouraging manner. Carrie allowed herself a few seconds to debate whether she'd misinterpreted Emily's instructions. If she had, it could be disastrous for the future of whatever their relationship was. Well, fuck it, she thought; she was here already; naked in bed with him and his cock in her hands.

Joel let out a loud gasp of pleasure as she started to suck his cock. Carrie kept her eyes on his face as she massaged his cock with her tongue, occasionally taking it all the way to the back of her mouth. Her rhythm was casual and sensual at first, her left hand toying with the necklace like they had all the time in the world to enjoy the act. His eyes were shut still and he seemed more delirious than ever. His cock throbbed in her mouth, fully alive with excitement and pleasure. An old feeling stirred within her - the power of a man in your mouth. All this pussy of late and she'd completely forgotten the thrill of turning a man to mush with just the palm of your hand and your tongue - every woman's superpower. In her younger years she'd been amazed that men even allowed women to suck their cocks. It occurred to Carrie that it wouldn't take much to do some serious damage to any man, if one so desired; or even if one did not. She'd slathered her fair share of dick in her time and it seemed there was always a fine line between working it like a filthy little bitch and biting down hard and vampiric-ally ripping a man's pride from his body. Here with Joel she felt comfortably on the right side of such cannibalistic tendencies. She worked his dick good, using her big lips to smother her spit all the way from the bottom of the shaft to the pulsating purple helmet, then descending her wide mouth down upon it until it prodded the back of her throat. Joel may have not been fully conscious but his body reacted accordingly regardless. He started to whine uncontrollably. At first Carrie thought it sounded pathetic but then she felt the pleasure of knowing that her skills were capable of reducing a man to such a state.

Joel started to mutter more, desperate to try and form coherent words. ""...uh, uhh...uh...yeh...Em..."" Carrie sucked harder when she heard Emily's name. She didn't even stop to consider before making a ""Mmmmm Hmmmm!"" sound encouragingly without breaking pace on her head bobbing. ""Em, fuck, yeah...baby.""

She could be Emily for the night, if that's what he wanted. She remembered a night about a month ago on this very bed with Emily spread eagle and her on top and between Emily's legs with two drenched wet fingers inside her vagina. Just when she thought she couldn't get any deeper inside her, Emily had pulled her knees up and Carrie was gifted with just the right angle to delve ever so deeper and gently massage her cervix. She remembered strongly the feeling of their bodies and minds combining into one as she watched the orgasm signal in Emily's eyes and then sealing her wide mouth on top of hers as she'd frigged her over the line. So the thrill of inhabiting Emily's presence was not something she was unaccustomed or un-attracted to. Again, whether this was something Emily would approve of she couldn't be a hundred percent sure; but it was happening now.

""That's it, baby. I've got you,"" she said to Joel.

Suddenly Joel reached down and grabbed her by the hair, using it to hold her head in place as his hips started to thrust upwards towards her mouth. He whined louder and she moaned through his cock all at the same time. She relinquished control and opened her mouth wide, allowing herself to be used. His resolve only lasted a few seconds before he gave up. Immediately she took back over, bobbing her hot mouth up and down over the helmet of his cock. She wanted him to wake up and witness this wonderful moment properly - his white hard cock disappearing inside her pretty black mouth; her pink tongue contrasting erotically with the skin of his wet dick. She chose, however, to leave him in whatever state he was in.

Carrie felt her own stimulation heighten despite only the act of pleasuring this man to progress it. She took his cock from her mouth and jerked it roughly as she planted her big wet tongue against his ballsack and circled it around luridly. At this Joel's whine turned into a loud moan of what sounded like anguish. Carrie knew that he loved it and made a perverted moan herself as she wrapped her tongue around every last inch of his soft skin and felt his balls tumble around her mouth. It was that moment when she decided she needed to fuck this man. It was time.

She abandoned the cock and threw herself onto her back beside him. Her legs wide open, she immediately began to massage her clit. Her pussy lips were swollen red and hungry for punishment. She knew she was full of wetness but without an engaged partner to coax it from her depths she would need to do a little work to get herself ready. She used two fingers from her left hand to separate her lips; then with her right hand she licked two fingers and quickly dipped them into her raging vagina. Ten seconds work was all it took and her wetness was seeping forth and spread out around her entire groin area, her pussy lips now as wet as her mouth. She sprung back up to her knees and threw a leg over Joel's mid region, straddling him finally.",,2025-08-15T19:13:49.483303,3710,
https://www.literotica.com/s/lesbian-seductress-ch-06-the-history-teacher-pt-04,Lesbian Seductress Ch. 06: The History Teacher Pt. 04,Unknown Author,,,,,"*I have to thank one of my followers for the advice she gave me for parts of this story. She remains anonymous and is a valued cyber friend.

*The possible return of Lynn Bowman, the irresistible teen seductress who seduced history teacher Mary Collins. But the appearance of a beautiful college student observer tempting said teacher is what this story is about.

It was the beginning of the second semester. Mindy and Tammy were no longer in my classes. I hadn't had the opportunity to have another sexual escapade with either at that point, but it didn't matter. My goddess, the seductive teen that introduced me to the pleasures of girl on girl lovemaking, was returning after two years. She would be arriving in five days and staying with me while back in town. She was all I could think about, all I wanted, no, all I needed. That beautiful face, those captivating eyes and cherry lips, her ample, firm breasts, long shapely legs and, of course, her sweet, shaved, pear-shaped pussy I loved so much. All that would be mine soon.

This semester the local college was sending another student to observe my classes, another possible secondary teacher. Most of the observers in the past were men and a few girls, none of which were the least bit attractive. It's funny how, now that I think of it in the sexual situation I am in, I look back and am so judgmental! I was not concerned by what they were there for, only their looks. I read the note from the college that an Eve Martin was coming to observe for four weeks. She would be sitting in on my last period AP class. I surmised she would be another generic, average looking bookworm. I mean, who wants to teach today? Plus, I had Lynn on my mind, counting the days to her arrival. I couldn't care less about this observer. I'd soon find out that I was mistaken.

Monday came. It was the first day of the second semester. I had two morning classes, then lunch and a free block, and last period AP History. After finishing lunch, which I sometimes spent in my classroom, I scanned my AP roster and developed a seating chart for twelve students. Just then there was a knock on the door.

""Come in, the door is unlocked.""

The door opened and a very attractive young girl entered. She was average height, cute, but in a sexy way, with wavy chestnut hair, dark brown eyes and full lips. I loved that she wore black rimmed glasses. There is just something for me about a girl in glasses that just makes her more appealing. She wore pretty flowered dress that ended just above the knees. Her legs were shapely, and I could see that she had ample breasts. I immediately locked in on her as she approached my desk.

""Hi, Mrs. Collins. I'm Eve Martin. I'll be observing your AP class for four weeks. It's a pleasure to meet you.""

I got up from my chair to shake her hand. I thought to myself, 'Here we go! What if...' I caught myself and shook her hand.

""It's a pleasure to meet you, Eve. I must say thank you to the college for sending such a beautiful girl. I hope your ambition matches your appearance. Oh, and you can call me Ms. Collins.""

I thought my statement to be slightly awkward, but I wanted her to know that I noticed and appreciated her beauty.

""Why thank you, Ms. Collins. You are incredibly beautiful yourself. Now I know what other faculty members told me about you is true, besides being an excellent teacher. I am so excited to work with you.""

I thought, 'And hopefully very closely!'

""Thank you, Eve. Why don't you pull up a chair and I'll show you what I have planned for us. Little did she know what I was thinking.

She grabbed a chair and sat beside me. I noticed that she allowed her dress to ride up high, giving me a view of her silky thighs. When she crossed her legs, it rode even higher, almost exposing her panties. The smell of her perfume was intoxicating. My nipples grew hard and were now visible through my blouse. As I explained my plans, her hand moved down to the tops of her thighs and began to gently massage them, then running her hand between them. I couldn't help but look. I wasn't sure if she was teasing me or just acting naturally, but either way she was turning me on.

As I explained my grading system to her, she leaned into me so that she could see the fine print in my gradebook, her left breast pressed against my arm. It was so firm and full. She stayed in that position for maybe twenty seconds as she scanned my notes. Then she surprised me with a question. Her face was inches from mine. She looked directly into my eyes.

""Ms. Collins, sorry to interrupt, but may I ask what fragrance you are wearing today?""

It brought back memories of the day Lynn Bowman seduced me.

""Chanel. It's a little on the pricey side but I think it's worth it.""

""It's intoxicating. I will have to buy some.""

""For your boyfriend?"", I probed.

""Oh, I don't have a boyfriend, Ms. Collins"", she said, again looking deep into my eyes.

And she left it at that. Did she mean at that moment, or did she mean she prefers girls? My mind was running in all directions trying to figure out what was going on. Was she sending me clues? Had she heard the rumors about me and coming on to me? Was it just my imagination? Either way, she was getting me mildly aroused.

""So, Eve, are you ready to begin your journey?""

""Yes, Ms. Collins. I'm so looking forward to working closely with you"", she said as she squeezed my hand. It sent chills up my spine. I felt a twinge in my pussy. My nipples were now very noticeable as were hers. This was getting very hot. I wanted to take her right then and there, tear that dress off and ravage her. But my professional self took over. Oh, and the class would be starting in ten minutes!

As the class entered, Eve took a seat off to the right of the room a little behind the students but still in my view. After giving the class their assigned seats, I introduced Eve and told them that she would be observing and assisting me for the next four weeks. Most of the time the first day was getting to know the students, explaining the course, handing out materials, and, for the last twenty minutes, working in groups of four on the first assignment. I walked over to Eve and asked her to accompany me as I checked on each group. She was going to work out just fine based on her interaction with the students. I was also hoping she would 'work out' even finer with me.

The final bell rang, and the students filed out. I was seated at my desk when Eve approached. She leaned back against the edge, her dress now well above her knees, one leg over the other, her tempting thighs exposed. I couldn't help but stare and didn't care if she noticed.

""Today was wonderful, Ms. Collins"", she said, my eyes still focused on her beautiful legs. My tongue instinctively licked my lips as I raised my head to thank her for her help.

""Thank you for coming today, Eve. I'm sure we are going to get along very well together, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.""

""Why wait until tomorrow, Ms. Collins? How about I treat you to dinner at a little bistro I frequent.""

""I...""

""Don't worry, it's very reasonable and I can afford it. What do you say, Ms. Collins?""

Her hand slid down to her left thigh and ran up the side lifting her dress even more there so that for an instant I caught a glimpse of her blue laced panties. Was she just excited and this was an innocent reaction to her inviting me or was she teasing me. I would soon find out.

""Well, since you put it that way. How can I refuse a free meal and date from such a beautiful young lady? OK, I'm in?"", I laughed and stood up.

""Great! I'll meet you at Luca's Bistro at 6. Do you know it?""

""No, but I will find it.""

""How about I pick you up! After all, you said that this was a date. It would be rude to make you drive to meet me. What do you say, Ms. Collins?""

""You are persistent! Fine. I'll give you my address. When do you want to come for me (I was really thinking 'cum for me')?""

""I'll come by at 5:45.""

""Very well. I'll be outside waiting for you.""

""Perfect. Look for the white BMW. See you tonight, Ms. Collins.""

Then, to my surprise, she moved on and gave me a hug, paused and looked at me.

""Please wear that perfume tonight, Ms. Collins.""

She smiled, broke the hug and left the room. When I arrived home, you all know what I did. That's right, I masturbated imagining what might be ahead with this young beauty.

After taking a well-deserved hot shower, I took a short nap. I decided to show off my body, so I chose my tightest fitting, shortest and lowest cut dress. My breasts are still firm, so I decided to go braless. A pair of heels and thigh high nylons completed my look. I figured that if she was coming for me, I might as well display what was waiting for her.

5:45 and a white BMW approached. I opened the door and slid in and looked over to see a stunning young girl. Tonight, she left her glasses at home, and she was even more beautiful without them. She wore a short skirt, short enough to see the tops of her nylons when driving, and a lacy, dark blue sheer top clear enough to see her breasts sitting high, nipples barely covered by strategically placed material. She finished it off with heels. I wanted to devour her right there!

""Wow!"", she said. ""You look ravishing!"" She leaned into me. ""Mmmmm. Thank you for wearing that beautiful fragrance, Ms. Collins.""

""It's what you wanted, Eve. I wouldn't want to let my pretty date down, now would I. And I must say, if I look ravishing, you look even more ravishing! The guys at school must die when they see you.""

""Yes, but I just ignore them.""

That was the second time she seemed to hint she wasn't interested in boys. I thought I would pursue it at dinner.

We arrived at Luca's and were shown to our table by a very attractive young girl who seemed to know Eve. They gave each other a hug and a peck on the cheek and a look I recognized. Things were beginning to make sense to me. I was going to pursue the 'Yes, but I just ignore them' comment at some point.

""Well, Ms. Collins. What do you think of Luca's?""

""It's very nice and I love Italian. It's a little out of the way. How did you ever find it?""

""The girl who saw us to our table and I were roommates. She started working here about two years ago and I've been coming ever since.""

""She is quite beautiful, like you, Eve.""

""Yes, and Julie is even more beautiful in lingerie"", she giggled.

""I'll bet she is. And such long legs! The boys must have loved the two of you"", I said, probing.

""I'm sure they did but we paid no attention to them. And by the way, she not only has beautiful legs, Ms. Collins.""

""Please, you can call me Mary outside of school, Eve. Yes, I can see that"", I said as Julie approached the table. She also had what appeared to be ample breasts.

""Don't the two of you look lovely this evening. Who is your friend, Eve?""

""This is Ms. Mary Collins, the history teacher whose class I am observing for the next four weeks.""

""So nice to meet you, Mary. I'm Julie.""

""Yes, Eve just filled me in about you.""

""How much did she tell you?"", she said with a sly smile.

""That you were roommates and that you ignored the boys.""

""True and true, Mary. Welcome to Luca's. Can I get the two of you something to drink?""

""Go ahead, Mary"", Eve said. ""It's on me.""

I thought, 'I'd love to be on you!'

We ordered drinks and looked at the menu. Both of us ordered pasta and the chat began.

""Eve, it's so nice of you to treat me like this!""

""It's very nice of you to take me in as an observer. A lot of teachers can't be bothered.""

""That's true, Eve. Most of the student observers I get are very competent but, I hope I don't embarrass you, none of them were as beautiful as you. When you walked in, I was stunned by your beauty. My male students are going to love you!""

""Thank you, Mary, but I'm sure they feel the same way about you. I had heard you were not only a great teacher, but that you were gorgeous. That was an understatement!""

""Thank you. Why don't come sit next to me. I never like it when I have to talk across the table at my date.""

""Ah, so you like the idea of a date?""

""With you, yes, Eve. Very much. This is very sweet of you to treat me."" She came around and sat beside me. I leaned in and whispered, ""You will have to let me know what I can do to repay you.""

She looked me in the eye. ""Be careful what you ask for, Mary"", she said placing her hand on my thigh.

""Sounds delicious, just like that incredible top you are wearing. I don't think you could wear that anywhere else but here. I can think of a few things I could do with you seeing what is underneath. Your breasts are breathtaking. Maybe we can talk about it at my home after dinner.""

Her hand moved up my thigh, inches from my wet panties.

""I'd love that, Mary"", she said moving closer to me. She leaned in and whispered in my ear as her hand reached my pussy. ""You know I want you, don't you?""

Her fingers began slowly tracing my pussy.

""Yes, Eve. And you will have me.""

Just then Julie, who had been watching us, came with our food.

""Here you go, girls. Hope you enjoy the meal as much as you will enjoy each other."" She smiled slyly, turned and walked away. I could only imagine she and Eve together and wondered if they wouldn't mind a third!

When dinner ended, we made our way through a dark parking lot to her car. As I approached the passenger door, she grabbed me from behind, turned me, and pressed her body onto mine.

""I wanted you the moment I saw you, Mary.""

She closed in. Our lips met, mouths opened, and we kissed. She was so tender, and I was so eager. Her hand slid up between my thighs and reached my now wet panties. As we kissed, she began stroking me with a touch that was so gentle until one finger pulled my panties aside allowing it to enter me. Our kisses became more passionate as her finger slowly penetrated deeper. Then there were two, my legs opened wider to let her in.

""God, Eve. You are so beautiful. I have to confess; I was yours as soon as you walked in. All I needed to know was if you wanted me.""

We continued kissing as my hand moved to her breasts, lifting and squeezing, running my fingers over her nipples. They were so full and firm. I could feel her nipples getting hard under my touch. Her hand continued working my pussy and I wanted her to take me right there,

but this was not the place.

""Let's get back to my house, Eve, before we do each other right here!""

We jumped into the car and headed home. After parking her car in the garage, we entered the house and again fell into each other's arms, like two teenagers with raging hormones. I let her take the lead. She guided me to the couch.

Eve began kissing my neck and ear, her hand caressing my breasts. She was so gentle. Then we kissed. She was so tender. Her tongue danced with mine as her hand reached down my dress and released my breasts. We kissed like that for I don't know how long. I loved kissing her. I lost track of time as her hands kneaded my breasts and sometimes ran up my thighs to lightly touch and stroke my silk panties covering my slightly wet pussy.

""They are amazing, Mary, so perfect. I want to kiss them. Do you want me to kiss them, Mary?""

""Oh, yes, Eve. Please!""

""I'm going to make you climax over and over, Mary.""

She leaned in and lifted my breast to her pretty lips, first softly kissing it all over, going from one to the other as I leaned back pushing them out to her.

""Mmmmmm. Oh, Eve. That's so gooood.""

Then she began teasing my hard nipples, first with her tongue, then her lips as she drew them in, softly sucking at first, then gently biting. She continued pleasuring them for several minutes. I placed my hands on her head. I wanted her to devour them! She was making me wait, which only increased my arousal.

""Please, Eve. Suck harder!""

She wasted no time sucking them, popping them in and out of her hungry mouth, licking, lapping and sucking again. I felt myself close to climax and a few seconds later, I did!

""Oh Eve!!! OOOOOOOHHHHHHH, FUCK!!!'

""That's so good, Mary, but I'm not finished.""

Before I knew it, she had removed my dress and it dropped to the floor. She began kissing and stroking my nylon clad legs, working her way up to my wet pussy. She kissed my inner thighs and all around my opening. First she placed a kiss on me through my panties.

""Mmmmmm. You smell so sweet, Mary. So sweet!""

Then she pulled them down and threw them aside. I felt her hot breath on me. She wasted no time and began slowly licking, up and down the opening. I was moaning and moving on her, thrusting my hips out to her as her tongue began penetrating my burning pussy. She found my clit and licked it. I began moaning and talking to her.

""Mmmmmm. Oh...Oh...Don't stop....Oh my God!""

The gentle, rhythmic flicking of her tongue and the light touch of her fingers was taking me to a place where I wanted to be.

""Yes, Eve, just like that....Yes, right there....Ooohhhh....Mmmmmm...Please...Oh, Please!""

The tender slow licking and playing with my clit was so incredible. Then she took it up a notch.

""Mmmmm, Mary, you are so delicious!"", she said lapping my pussy while using two fingers to penetrate me, first slowly and then, as she felt me tensing up, more rapidly. I moved in rhythm with here pace, getting closer and closer to an orgasm that I would long remember. She was driving me crazy! I was delirious. This incredibly beautiful young thing was bringing me to another amazing climax. I felt the spasms and then the explosion! An ocean of sheer ecstasy engulfed me!

""Eve!!!! Eve!!!! OH GOD!!!! I'm cumming again! AAAAHHHHHH!""

She licked me clean, every ounce! I was completely spent and, believe it or not, half asleep. The next thing I knew, Eve had left. She destroyed me sexually and I couldn't reciprocate, but my opportunity would come.

Tuesday came and as I prepared for my AP class during my free period, Eve walked in. She was as radiant as the day before. Glasses back on, she was dressed in a pretty blue dress. There was no hint of the vixen she was. She looked like a typical teacher, but I knew better.

""Good morning, Eve.""

""Good morning, Mary...I mean Ms. Collins"", she laughed.

""You were spectacular last night, Eve. I'm so sorry I passed out.""

""It's OK. That usually happens when I first seduce a beautiful girl.""

There was an hour left in my free period and I wanted her right there and then. I have a small storage closet in the far corner of my room that was just installed. It was the perfect place for the two of us. I stood up, walked to the door and locked it. Eve knew where this was leading and played along.

""Why, Ms. Collins, are you going to take advantage of me?""

""No, Eve. I would never do anything you didn't want me to do"", continuing the role play. ""Why don't you help me with my inventory. Come with me.""

I took her hand and led her to storage, closed the door a backed her up against the wall.

""I would love to take inventory of your spectacular body first. Do you mind, Eve?""

""Please do, Ms. Collins. I'm an open book.""

""Hmmmm. I think I'll page through.""

I moved in and kissed those cherry lips as my hand ran up her thigh. Our tongues met, seeking, darting as I felt the wetness that had already appeared on her panties. My hand played with her pussy, gently stroking. I moved from her lips to the gentle curve of her neck as she leaned her head back accepting my kisses and gentle biting.

""I want your breasts, Eve. I want to devour them!""

I stepped back and unbuttoned her dress until her ample bosom was visible. I lifted them out.

""God, you are so beautiful, Eve"", I said as my hands caressed them. I could hear her sighs as I leaned in and kissed the soft skin around her now hard nipples. I teased her for a while until she begged me to suck them, which I did without hesitation. God, they were so delicious! I bit her hard nipples, gently pulling on them. She thrusted them out to me, hands over her head. They were incredible!",,2025-08-15T19:13:56.453947,3757,

It made me sick to see how happy Daddy was to have his little Arab fuck slave back. I wasn't there to see it in person, thank God, but when I watched the footage, I counted roughly 12 seconds elapsing between them hugging at the door and his cock pounding her pussy in the bedroom. Daddy just dragged her through the house, tore her clothes off and threw her to the bed. She didn't say a word in objection or even try to resist. She let Daddy have her any way he wanted. She let him cum in her pussy and begged him for more because she wasn't sure he'd gotten her pregnant yet.

God, I hate that Whore. I didn't think I would ever hate anything more than The Bitch, but she managed to surprise even me. In a way, it's almost funny. I'll be sure to have a good laugh about it someday . . . after I beat her face in with a shovel.

Her time

was

coming. Even as I sat in my Control Room, watching the surveillance monitors and cameras I had installed across every inch of my home, I had plans. I'd make sure the little slut knew what happened when you crossed

me

.

-EILEEN-

David was so happy to see Katy again. I don't think I'd ever seen him smile like that . . . not since the day I said 'Yes' as he slipped the ring on my finger or when he found out I was pregnant with our first child. I knew he liked Katy, but this went beyond just personal fondness. He didn't treat her like the other girls. He didn't even treat her like Ronnie or me—he was obsessive over Katy . . . controlling. He treated her like a servant more than a lover . . . and Katy was just happy to please him. It would have been really cute . . . if this weren't

my

husband I were seeing.

Fortunately, David eventually stopped fucking her in our . . .

my

. . . bedroom. Unfortunately, he converted his reading room into a second bedroom for her. I wondered how Ronnie felt about that, since the house was technically hers, but she never seemed to care. Whenever I saw Ronnie, it was business as usual: fucking David at any opportunity and ignoring me as much as possible.

Thinking about all this, I sighed and checked my pregnancy test again. Nothing.

I was still only 45, and as far as I knew, my biological clock was ticking fine. My doctors said that I was still probably a few years away from menopause, and I would be able to conceive.

If

I ever conceived. Unfortunately, all my life, I've had what doctors referred to as ""poor egg quality"". David and I had tried for 13 months straight before I got pregnant with Rhonda, and it took almost a full year before we had William. Worse yet, my medical condition only worsened with age. I had no idea when . . . or if . . . I would ever get pregnant again . . . but David wanted me to. It was risky for a woman at my age, and my doctors had urged me to get my tubes tied . . . but David wanted a baby from me.

Why did I even want one? I don't know . . . I guess I just wanted to please ""my"" David. Well . . . he's not ""mine"", really. Not anymore. Seven weeks ago, David got Ronnie pregnant again. Two weeks after that, it was the Thai girl, Papao. Then the East Indian girl, Poojintha. After that, the Czech girl, Ivana. And, of course, he was really,

really

trying hard to put another one in Katy. And it's gotten even worse since he lost his job. This

was

his job now. David was putting babies in sexy young women like he was some sort of pregnancy vending machine.

I still didn't understand—where did Ronnie find all of these girls? Where had they all come from, and why were they all foreigners? Why did they want David's babies so badly? Some of them didn't even speak a word of English! I had the feeling that there was something

terrible

going on . . . that we were all party to something horrible. Like everything about Ronnie, though, I couldn't prove any of it . . . so I just kept it to myself. Every night, though, I prayed that God would keep us safe.

Everything about my ""new life"" left me so conflicted. The new David . . . I hated him, but I wanted him so much. When David would fuck me, I never wanted it to end. It was so rough, so physical and so passionate. I wanted him to keep using me. David would tear my clothes off of me. He would bend me over whenever he felt like and fuck me there. He would push me on my back and put my legs on his shoulders. He would fuck me strongly, and bite my tits like an animal. He spanked me until my ass was burning with his handprint. He pulled my hair until the roots almost felt like they would tear. He would keep pounding into me the whole time, fucking me like I'd never been fucked before. Fucking me with the strength and energy of a man half his age.

But eventually, it would be over. And when nighttime came, I slept in my bed alone. David was a better lover than I'd ever known, but I had to

share

him now.

God help me, I don't know how to fix this. I want to have my husband back . . . but I don't want to give up this incredible feeling. It's a selfish contradiction, but I can't help myself. The other girls make me feel so weak and stupid and helpless and ugly . . . but David makes me feel amazing. I don't know how to give up one without the other! And Ronnie would never let me divorce David—she would never risk letting me go! No matter how much I worried or thought or prayed, I just didn't see a way out.

And every day, I slipped closer toward just giving up.

One night, Katy came out of ""her"" room dressed in nothing but one of David's t-shirts. Sweat covered her whole body from head-to-toe, making the fabric stick to her shapely body whenever she moved. I could even see her perky, healthy nipples poking through the front. She was practically

floating

as she meandered through my home, heading to the kitchen for what I could only assume was a mid-fuck-snack. She didn't notice me at all, even though I was less than twenty feet away, burning into her with my eyes.

I could hear her in the kitchen for several minutes, moving things, rustling through my neat cabinets for God-knows-what. Whatever she was doing was making an ugly racket, so I lifted myself from my seat and stalked her into the kitchen.

""Um . . . can I help you?""

She finally broke from her daze and her head whipped around to look at me. Even with her heavy makeup smudged and weathered from sweat, she was still crazy gorgeous. I hated that. Why was every girl having sex with my husband so much younger and prettier than me?! I was sure, in my earlier years, I could have given them a run for their money—but 24 years and four kids later . . . I didn't stand a chance.

""Oh, hello,"" she said sweetly. ""I'm sorry. I was just looking for some sort of beer. David said that he would like one.""

She turned back around and bent over to look deeper into the fridge. David's shirt pushed up on her thighs just slightly, and I was able to get a glimpse of his thick, silvery seed seeping down her thighs.

Globs

of it. It was absolutely obscene . . . there was so much of it leaking from the girl's pussy that there was no doubt what David was trying to do with her.

Well, it wasn't like I didn't know that anyway. Straight from the horse's mouth, David had told me. The only thing he cared about now was making babies . . . and using young womens' bodies for that purpose had become his passion—his obsession.

Did this girl even know who David was now? Did she know that Rhonda was just using her as a means to an end? She was just a tool to keep my husband brainwashed. To keep his mind so addicted to pleasure that he would never even

think

of questioning our daughter.

""Oh, I've found it!"" she exclaimed, removing herself from the fridge and producing a tall can of Miller. ""Thank you so much for your help!""

I was stunned. There wasn't a hint of sarcasm in her voice. ""Thanks? For what? I didn't do anything.""

She smiled and began to sashay closer to me, kicking the fridge closed behind her. ""Oh, I think you being here made me think a little clearer. I came here a bit light-headed after . . . well . . . after such a busy afternoon.""

I guess she stopped herself from saying, 'After fucking your husband for four and a half hours straight.' Somehow, the attempt to spare my feelings only made me feel even worse.

""Well, now you've got what you wanted. So I guess you can go back to trying to fuck David to death,"" I said, heated.

She smiled at me. But not in the way I expected. Not in triumph or in contempt. Not with the malicious intent to destroy what was left of my marriage.

Instead, she only smiled at me with genuine joy and then said, ""That would be selfish, wouldn't it?""

Then, she disappeared into the bedroom again and the door shut behind her. Roughly ten minutes later, the bed began creaking. Two minutes after that, the moaning started.

******

""She's going to destroy us, you know.""

Startled, I spun and saw Rhonda standing in the doorway, wearing her favorite robe.

""R-Ronnie . . .?"" I stammered. ""What . . . what are you . . .?""

""I spent thirteen years planning everything to the letter. I had it all so perfect. I knew how to make Daddy happy. I knew how I could finally win the man of my dreams. And I knew how I could finally punish you. To make you pay penance for your colossally misguided mistakes.""

I couldn't look her in the eyes. Once again, the shame washed over me. I knew what she was talking about—the moment which still haunted me to this day. She knew how much it hurt to be reminded of it. She knew how much pain it had caused me over the years and how desperate I'd always been to make up for it.

Everything Rhonda was doing to me now . . . Everything that had happened to my family . . . I'd caused from my own actions.

""We were all happy, weren't we? Daddy was so happy—you could see it in his eyes. I was so happy . . . .""

She touched her belly. Even though it didn't show much now, David's child was growing there as we spoke.

""And you were happy, too, weren't you? You find this as kinky as Daddy and I do, don't you?""

Despite myself, I felt a twinge of lust at the thought. No matter how much I tried to fight it, I had to admit that seeing our daughter pregnant with my husband's child turned me on. Rhonda's body was immaculate—she was a perfect hourglass, with as wide and curvaceous as her amazing bust. Her tummy was toned and fit, with nary a hint of ugly fat. Her legs were long, lithe and slender—just as David liked them, and she always wore the same heeled slippers to show them off.

I still couldn't believe she had ever come out of

my

body.

What happened that made

me

get shafted by the genetics in this family? My mother, David's mother, and Ronnie were all still gorgeous to this day. Why was I the only one struggling with her weight, or using makeup to hide her crows' feet? Why did the ""hotness"" gene skip me and go straight to Rhonda? It wasn't fair!

Still, Rhonda was a sight to behold. I no longer had any compulsions about admitting it. In fact, I could even admit that Rhonda had finally helped me realize my bi-curiosity. Even now, the only reason I was disappointed to see Ronnie was because she didn't have her studded dildo with her. God, she always knew how to fuck me with it until I hollered and screamed like a banshee.

But when I looked down at her crotch, she was bare. Ronnie, of course, picked up on it. She smiled at me. Slowly, Rhonda's nubile body existed the door way. Slowly, her hip swayed and her heels clicked on the floor as she stepped closer. Eventually, she stood next to me . . . so close that I could feel her heat. The folds of her robe had fallen aside, letting me get a view of my daughter's breasts. They were ripening so well . . . slowly swelling with milk for my grandchild.

Ronnie gently reached up and slipped her finger into my mouth. I suckled on it gently, instinctively licking and coating it with my own saliva. In the meantime, Ronnie's other hand had pushed away my tight leggings, making them fall down to my knees, leaving me in my bright, soaked panties. Ronnie's nails scratched roughly against the soft cheeks of my rear, and traveled slowly up my spine. It felt like lightning shoot up from the small of my back.

I was already under her spell. My eyes were closed, and my arms had fallen limp. I let my daughter do whatever she wished with me. It hurt, but in a good way. I knew Ronnie hated me, but she knew how to perfectly blend pleasure with the pain. My nipples were hard, and my breasts perky . They reached out from my chest as if drawn to my daughter's rack. I wanted to press my tits against hers. I wanted to feel her body against mine.

Ronnie slipped her finger out, letting a trail of shimmering spit fall from my lips. Her hand slowly rolled down my belly, both tickling my tummy and making my heart race with excitement.

Finally, I felt two of Rhonda's fingers gently slip into her mother's pussy.

""I assume that you're hoping I'll fuck you again,"" she said as she gently fingered my pussy.

Embarrassed, I didn't answer. I only moaned as my hips ground against my daughter's fingers, gushing loads of cum all over them.

Then, just as quickly as it started, Rhonda pulled away. Her fingers were still gooey with my juices, and my pussy was aching to be played with.

""No . . .! Please, Ronnie! Don't stop!""

""Well, blame

her

,"" she said, indicating the next room, filled by the ecstatic screams of the youthful Katy. ""If she doesn't go, we may never have an opportunity like this again.""

I swallowed. ""What . . . what do you mean, Ronnie?""

She gave me a familiar look. The 'Are-You-Stupid?' Look. She had been using it on me ever since she was

four.

""In case you haven't forgotten, the three of us: you, me, and Daddy, are all committing a felony. The three of us are all related by blood."" She again nodded toward the bedroom. ""But her? She's different. This is all fun to her. It's just a game. She can have as much fun as she wants with us. She can destroy our entire family and walk away unscathed. Then everyone loses—you, me, Daddy—and all of our children.""

My heart paced wildly. I hadn't considered it—I had just become so used to Ronnie being in control that I thought that there was no way we could get caught. Ronnie was so smart . . . so brilliant. She had planned everything so perfectly. She, David and I could fuck as much as we wanted and no one would ever find out.

But now, with this girl around . . .

Ronnie saw that I was starting to understand. She smiled at me, knowingly. I think, just for that instant, she didn't think of me as an idiot.

""I made a mistake bringing her around. She's more trouble than she's worth, and now I have to get rid of her without being conspicuous.""

I swallowed. ""G-get r-rid of her?""

Ronnie's expression remained blank. She simply looked me in the eye and asked me:

""If you had to . . . could you kill her?""

""K-Kill . . .?!"" I nearly fainted. ""I don't think I could . . . I don't know how to . . .""

""I'm not telling you to do it,"" Ronnie continued. ""I'm only asking if you

could

. Even if you

hate

me, would you do it to protect your husband? Your children? Your

grandchildren?!

""

My babies . . . all of them were precious to me. Even the grandchildren David had made with Ronnie. Even the ones he had made with other women . . . they were all so innocent. I could never let anything happen to them.

""I . . . I don't know. I . . . I suppose if I had no choice . . . to . . . to save my family . . . ""

She smiled at me. The look in her eye . . . I don't think I'd seen anything like it in

years

. She waltzed up to me, her beautiful hips swaying ever so gently. Her fingers gently caressed my cheek, and then she leaned over to give me a loving kiss.

Then softly, she said: ""Thank you, Mommy. That's all I needed to know.""

******

Ronnie had given me lots to think about. I spent the rest of the night stewing it over in my mind. I was so deep in thought that I barely even heard the moans, screams and grunts in the bedroom. If I had been, I would have noticed from the sounds David was making that he'd just cum inside Katy again. That would mean it was time for another break.

She came out of the room once more. This time, much less floaty and much more sore. Her pussy lips were swollen and inflamed, and she had even more of David's juice dripping from between her legs.

I cast one look at her, frowned, and then turned back to my magazine.

"". . . So I assume you don't approve?"" I heard her ask.

Instead of brushing it off, I responded reflexively.

""What, you think I should be

supportive

of my husband screwing another woman and trying to knock her up? That she spends more time with her than she does with

me?!

""

She didn't frown at me. She didn't have any strong reaction at all. I think my response was something she had been expecting.

Waiting for

, even.

""I see. I did not know this arrangement was not to your liking. After our original meetings, I thought you were much more willing to see me with David. You enjoyed our first sessions so much.""

I had almost forgotten that the first four times David and Katy had sex, I had been involved with them. Originally, David's ""affairs"" had started as threesomes, and David and I would meet with the girls together. Ronnie was taping us together—using it as leverage. It was her ace-in-the-hole, if David and I ever betrayed her.

But then, David changed. He began seeing most of the girls on his own. Katy was his favorite, by a mile. He had grown quite fond of her, and her willingness to completely submit to him. With Rhonda, David could never be in control, and with me, David still held back a little. Katy, however, would do anything David asked her to do without any reservations. As meek and sensitive as David had once been, in his middle age, he was starting to

relish

the power. He was becoming more assertive . . . more conquering.

I had forgotten Katy wouldn't know about any of that. She wouldn't have known what our home was like before she and the other girls showed up. Or what David had been like before all of this.

She wouldn't know how much she'd taken away from me. From all of us.

""I'm sorry,"" I said, even though I truly didn't want to apologize. ""Forget I said anything. Just . . . just do what you've got to do and go back into the bedroom. David is waiting for you."" I turned back to my magazine.

******

The day that my daughter was born was the happiest day of my life. My wife Eileen and I had been hoping for a child for years, and the day she announced that she was pregnant, I ran through our entire neighborhood screaming ""I'm gonna be a Daddy!"" at the top of my lungs. That little escapade embarrassed the hell out of Eileen, but I came home and immediately fucked her brains out, so she forgave me pretty quickly.

We settled rapidly into the groove of impending parenthood, becoming more excited as we watched her belly grow day-by-day. Of course, Eileen went through the typical mood swings and physical changes that came along with child-bearing, but I was patient, loving and understanding. My baby was giving me a baby . . . and there was nothing that could break my jubilance about that!

My daughter was born on July 9th, during the biggest heat wave of the year. Our apartment didn't have working air-conditioning, and I complained to the super about it constantly, worried about my wife and unborn daughter's health—even doubly so after she went into labor. For the next eleven hours, I was beside myself, worrying if suffering through the heat had induced my wife's labor and whether or not that would affect her health or the baby's. The hospital staff did their best to calm me down, and I knew they were doing all they could, but I'm a very excitable person—especially when it comes to my family.

Fortunately, after hours and hours of pure torture, my wife finally gave birth to a beautiful and healthy baby girl. We had already picked out a name for her: Rhonda, and we took turns holding her the entire night.

We were able to afford a bigger home, and things were going remarkably well at first. Rhonda was a relatively normal baby and infant, although our first sign that she was more than she appeared was when she began crawling in four months. Eileen and I were amazed, and even more so when Rhonda was outright able to RUN at six months. Not walk. Run. Eileen and I were excited that we had given birth to a real prodigy—a wonder child that would surpass all of our greatest hopes and dreams.

If only we knew.

Rhonda soaked up knowledge like a sponge. Eileen and I tried homeschooling until she was six, but she quickly outpaced our combined education. She was doing trigonometry by that age, and the most math I could remember was algebra. I was exceptionally good at English and Literature though, so I would continue to read with my daughter, and we used to talk afterwards and compare literary critiques. Rhonda's acumen was amazing, and she was able to pick up on greater subtext and abstruse themes than I could ever dream of doing. Eventually, rather than teaching her, she was beginning to teach ME, and I was captivated at learning what insight my little girl had to share.

However, things weren't all good. A few years after her birth, Eileen began to distance herself a bit from Rhonda, and she used to stand by and just watch our little girl play on her own or with other children, such as when her cousin Teddy came to play. Teddy was three years older than Rhonda and had a reputation for being something of a bully. I didn't like the kid, but he was my brother-in-law's brat, and Eileen was close to her big brother, so I really couldn't object. Besides, they were just kids: it's not like they could really get into trouble.

Like I said, though, Eileen began to distance herself from our daughter and secretly observed her whenever Rhonda didn't know she was around. At first, I thought it was some bizarre motherly instinct, but eventually, I began to suspect different. It seemed like Eileen sensed that there was something

wrong

with our daughter, and she wanted to keep her distance. Every once in a while, I tried talking her out of her behavior, and she would make an earnest effort to get closer to Rhonda, but it would always fail a few weeks, days, or even hours later.

Don't get me wrong—Eileen was a wonderful wife and mother in every other respect, but her detachment to Rhonda just didn't feel healthy. Rhonda seemed pretty happy, though, so I decided not to press the issue. I just doubled my efforts and decided to spoil my little girl rotten. I relished the time Rhonda and I spent together reading, watching movies, and discussing them afterwards. And I mean real, in-depth adult conversations. Sometimes, it felt a little weird that my young daughter seemed to be talking down to

me,

having to reword some things so that I could understand it, but I was immensely proud of her, so it didn't matter.

******

Things were pretty good for awhile. I bought Rhonda all the books she wanted, and she finished all of them immediately. She would always come to me immediately after, saying that they had left her with even more questions. I sat down and read them with her, and found myself suddenly unable to really keep up with my little girl's conversations anymore. But since she loved to talk to me, that didn't matter.

But Eileen was less than thrilled.

""I think this is getting worse, David,"" she told me as she paced back and forth, biting her nails. ""This . . . this isn't normal for a child to be acting like. She's not supposed to be reading those types of books like what you bought her.""

Again, I found myself trying to be the voice of reason. ""Well, Rhonda ISN'T normal,"" I corrected her, ""she's an unbelievably gifted child, and I think the longer we try and hold her back, the more confused and miserable we're going to make her.""

""Then what do we do, David? I can't keep up with her anymore, and even you're starting to struggle. I think it's time we considered other options. Maybe we should start seriously discussing hiring a tutor for Rhonda . . .""

I gave in and we stretched our financial resources to look into getting Rhonda some mentorship. Eventually, we found a professor from a local college who was used to dealing with exceptionally gifted children. With his help, Rhonda gained her high school diploma at seven and completed a full college curriculum by the time she was nine. My pride in her only grew as I watched my little prodigy develop, and Rhonda beamed at me whenever she saw the love in my eyes. During this time, however, I got laid off from my job and our family began hitting horrible financial straits. The only thing that kept us going was all of the money we got from schools looking to develop our daughter's 'gifts', but I felt really guilty exploiting my only child for my own gain.

One day, when Rhonda was eleven, Teddy was sleeping over at our home again. Eileen and I left he and Rhonda to play together while we sat down and discussed our current economic crisis. Eventually, we heard a scream in the living room and came to check. When we got there, Teddy was laying in the living room, trembling and holding his stomach while Rhonda was calmly sitting a chair, playing with her Game Boy. There was a lot of blood on the carpet underneath Teddy, and his shorts were pulled around his ankles. Eileen ran to call 911 while I went to Rhonda and asked what happened.

""Teddy and I were playing,"" she told me very calmly.

""Playing!? Ronnie, what the hell kind of playing ends with a boy's stomach bleeding?""

""Teddy said he wanted to 'play doctor'. At first I didn't want to, but he kept pushing, so I just tried to do a little surgery. But all of a sudden, he started crying that it hurt, and he didn't want to play anymore. I don't think he meant the same thing I thought he did, Daddy.""

I couldn't believe that Rhonda was reacting with such cold indifference. She had nearly cut her cousin's belly open, and didn't seem to give two shits about it. It was at that moment that I finally began to think that Eileen was right about Rhonda and that there really was something wrong with her. But I felt conflicted—just what had Teddy, that little punk, been trying to do? Upset, I left the room and sat with Eileen as we waited for the paramedics.

Eileen rode with them after they arrived and told her brother she'd meet him in the Emergency Room. In the meantime, I stayed home with Rhonda and wondered just what the hell I was going to do about this mess.

""What's wrong, Daddy? Did I do something I shouldn't have?"" she asked me with a very worried tone.

How the hell was I supposed to answer that? Frankly, I felt that the little punk got just a bit of pathos for whatever he had tried to do with his cousin. Of course, she always could have just yelled for Eileen and I, but would we even have believed her? If she'd screamed, it would have been her word against Teddy's, and Eileen had a habit giving that little snot too much due because he was her brother's kid.

What bothered me most, however, was the twinkle in Rhonda's eye. She didn't even seem to care that she had just effectively MAIMED a young boy.

Rhonda could see my apprehension, and she stepped closer . . . tears beginning to well in her eyes. ""Did I do something wrong, Daddy?""

""We'll talk later, Ronnie,"" I told her. ""Daddy needs to think right now.""

""Why don't we think together, Daddy?"" she asked me. ""All my fancy certificates say I'm good at it.""

""No, not this time, Ronnie,"" I argued. ""Just go to bed and sleep.""

Her eyes narrowed, and she stared right at me and declared: ""No.""

I shot disbelief right back at her. ""What did you say?""

""I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's wrong,"" she told me. ""It's not fair!""

""I decide what's 'fair', young lady,"" I hollered. This was the first time I'd ever gotten ANGRY at my daughter, and I was a bit too miffed and excited to be patient with her. ""I told you to go to bed and you will do what I say!""

She smiled at me. ""Make me.""

That set me off. I rushed at her and picked her up into my arms, kicking and screaming. I carried her into her room and threw her onto her bed even as she hammered on my back, hollering bloody murder. When I turned to leave, she grabbed onto my shirt tail and refused to let go. When I pulled her off, she would just pounce right back and grab it again.

This was far too exhausting for me, and I was far too old to be struggling with an eleven-year-old. I unbuckled my belt and looped it. Then, grabbing her hand tight, I spanked her with my belt until she began whimpering. She was fully-clothed, so I knew it wasn't really hurting her, but I had never spanked her before in my life, and I could tell she was really upset about it. Eventually, she finally let go of me and sank back on the floor, gasping for breath and softly whining.

""Now stay in here and don't cause any more trouble!"" I yelled. I slammed her door behind me and left.

******

Eileen didn't get home until late, and she returned with my brother-in-law Steven. The three of us sat in the living room—after I'd vigorously cleaned the blood from the carpet of course—and decided to talk things out.

""And that's what Rhonda says happened,"" I told them, finishing up my story.

""Really,"" Steven said, holding his chin in contemplation as his right leg lay folded over his left. ""That's certainly different from what Teddy told me in the hospital. He said that Rhonda wouldn't leave him alone and that she stabbed him for no reason.""

""Come on, Steve. Teddy

would

say that he wasn't doing anything wrong.""

""Well, she's always been an 'odd' kid, from what my sister tells me,"" Steve retorted. ""From what I hear, she's been doing all sorts of odd things, hasn't she? Like slicing the limbs off her dolls?""

I shot a glare at Eileen. I hadn't told ANYONE else about that little incident, not even my own family. But, of course, Eileen had run off and told her big brother just like she did with every other little hiccup in our marriage.

""Don't give me that look,"" she told me. ""I tried talking to you about it, but you always dismissed me like

I

was the one that was crazy.""

Steve nodded. ""And now, my son's paid the price because you wouldn't listen.""

""Wait just a damn second,"" I said, suddenly feeling very protective of my daughter. ""YOUR boy started this!""

""David!"" my wife yelled, but I wasn't listening. Neither was Steven, whom my words had clearly upset.

""Who are we supposed to believe!? My boy, who hasn't gotten in trouble a day in his life, or your little hellspawn in the making?!""

I jumped out of my seat. ""'Hasn't gotten trouble' my ass! Your boy's ALWAYS been a bully! Everybody in town knows that!""

""Rumors,"" Steven dismissed, rising from his chair as well. ""Teddy gets picked on just like every other kid in school. I taught him to fight back if anyone ever gave him issues.""

""How many 'issues' is your boy gonna get in with kids

smaller

than he is?"" I snapped. ""You want to talk about 'not listening to warnings', how much is it gonna take for you to realize that you got a little Cobra-fucking-Kai living with you?!""

""STOP IT!!""

Eileen stepped between us and tried to push us apart, but it was almost impossible for her to move two men whose combined weight was almost three times her own. However, with her there, neither of us were inclined to take our argument to the next level, because I sure as hell didn't want to hit my wife, and Steve didn't want to hurt his sister.

""Please, both of you sit down, and let's talk like we're supposed to be the adults.""

Steve and I took our seats again, but we were shooting daggers from across the room.

Eileen then turned and looked at me. ""David, maybe it's time that we got Rhonda . . . you know . . . some help . . .?""

My anger immediately shifted toward her. ""What?! Are you SERIOUSLY going to blame

our

daughter for this!? You're going to take HIS side!?""

She took a deep breath. ""Please calm down. I've been telling you for years that there's something wrong with—""

""Fuck calming down!"" I yelled. I was becoming so upset that my wife was taking her brother's side that I had totally forgotten about my 'episode' with Rhonda earlier. Now, instead of really thinking that there might have been some issues with my daughter, I was determined to protect her honor from the asshole brother-in-law who thought his own 'perfect' brat could do no wrong.

""If you're going to take

his

side, then what the fuck am I doing talking to you!?"" I stormed out of the living room and headed toward Rhonda's room.

""David, where are you going?""

I turned to answer her. Through the corner of my eye, I subconsciously thought I saw my daughter's door close just as I turned the corner, but my mind quickly dismissed it. ""Rhonda and I will stay someplace else tonight!"" I yelled, pushing my daughter's room open. ""You two can discuss how you want to blame her all you want while we're gone. But for now, she's going with me.""

""You can't . . . you can't just take my daughter out of here!""

""The hell I can't!"" I replied. I turned to Rhonda and said, ""Come on baby, get your coat and your games and stuff. You and Daddy are going someplace alone tonight.""

She didn't question me and immediately raced to get her things. I led her out of the house, with Eileen protesting the whole time.

******

I took Rhonda to an inn for the night. After I got there, I started to feel a little guilty about what I'd done, so I called Eileen and told her where we were. Afterwards, I settled in to try and get some sleep while Rhonda laid on the other bed, reading a new book that I hadn't seen before.

""Hey, princess,"" I said softly. ""What're you reading now?""

""Jungian psychology and how it applies to social dynamics in the 21st Century,"" she replied.

I winced, sorry I asked. ""Yeah, have fun with that, sweetie.""

She put the book down for a moment and asked, ""Am I really in trouble?""

""I don't think so, baby,"" I answered, although it was mostly a lie. ""Teddy was wrong, and he sorta deserved what he got.""

I regretted those words almost immediately. I shouldn't have said that. But, I was still pretty angry.

She smiled at me. ""So you believe me, Daddy?""

""Of course I do, sweetheart,"" I said with a returning smirk. ""You're my little angel and I won't let anybody hurt you.""

She got up from her bed and walked to mine, crawling next to me and leaning her head on my arm. ""I love you, Daddy,"" she said.

As I stroked her head, I told her, ""I love you too, darling. With all my heart.""

******

At some point, we must have fallen asleep watching television, because the next thing I remember was a knock at the door startling me. The knock was loud and forceful, and I wondered just who the hell it could possibly be.

""Hang on a minute!"" I yelled as the loud knocking persisted. I figured it was probably Eileen, or most likely Steven, considering how heavy the knocking was.

However, when the door swung open, I found two uniformed cops staring me down.

""David Scott?"" one of them asked.

""Y-Yes?""

""Your wife called us and complained that you'd kidnapped your daughter. We've come to take her home and place you in temporary custody.""

All at once, my built-up rage returned.

""My daughter is legally under my custody,"" I protested. ""And I didn't kidnap her. I took her out of the house because my wife, her brother and I were having an argument and I didn't want anyone to get hurt if emotions ran high.""

The officers simply stared at me with the same expression. One of them took a step inside the room. ""Just come with us, sir. We'll return the child to her mother for now, and we'll take you to the precinct tonight until things cool off and this all gets sorted out.""

""This is ridiculous!"" I protested, disobeying the cop's order to turn around. ""I look out for my daughter's best interests and

I

come out looking like the bad guy!? I told you, she's under my custody! You can't just walk in here and take her from me!""

The cops ignored my protests and one of them went over to grab my daughter. She began to yell for me.

""Noooo! I want to stay with Daddy! Stop it! Daddyyyyy!""

My daughter's screams only agitated me further. ""Dammit, let her go! Why won't you go and check to make sure I'm her legal guardian!? Just, take your hands off her and go straighten this out

now

.""

I tried to push past one of the officers, but he grabbed my arm, trying to force it behind my back. Running on paternal instinct and high on adrenaline, I took a swing at him. My fist connected to his jaw, and my left reeled back for a second strike. The next thing I knew, my second shot missed and I was face-first on the floor, with my stomach on fire and the officer's knees in my back.

""Mr. Scott, you're under arrest for assaulting an officer,"" he said. ""Please do not resist any further or you will risk bringing further charges against yourself. Do you understand?""

I only growled in response.

""DO YOU UNDERSTAND?""

""Yes, goddammit! Ow, you're hurting me! Ease up a little!""

As the officer's partner took my daughter away, screaming for her father to help her, I was led from our room in cuffs and stuffed into a squad car. Eventually, Eileen and Steven showed up to claim our daughter, but neither of them said a word to me. I just burned holes in them with my eyes from the back seat of the patrol car until the cops returned to cart me off to jail.

******

Eileen dropped the kidnapping charge, but I got sentenced to three years for the assault, although I only did nine months. Eileen and I worked through our differences, and she stuck by me faithfully while I did my time. In the meantime, she took Rhonda for psychiatric evaluation, although they were unable to find sufficient cause to declare our daughter as anything other than a troubled youth with a few sociological problems. They mostly blamed the problems on her relationship with Eileen—they said that Eileen's distrust and borderline dislike of her own daughter was, in turn, causing Rhonda to ""act out"" in socially awkward behavior. Eileen made an effort to correct the mistake and she told me that her relationship with Rhonda really improved over those months.

-DAVID-

""I want you to talk Mom into a threesome,"" Rhonda told me one evening as she lay atop me, breathing softly into my ear, our sweaty bodies writhing together as my cock slowly and delicately sawed in and out of her extremely wet cunt.

As she fed her rubbery nipple to my mouth, allowing my juicy, salivating lips to enclose upon my own little girl's hard areola, the surprise in my eyes made her smile. ""Oh no, not with me, Daddy. Haha. Do you

really

think I'd let that diseased harlot touch me? Noooo . . . I want you and The Bitch to have a threesome with a nice friend of mine. You'll like her, I think.""

Ronnie drew my lips to hers and kissed me deeply, our tongues wrestling feverishly as she sat in my lap, he hips rising and falling with a rhythm like slow machinework. Her saliva tasted like mint, and after all this time, she still wore that same exquisite perfume that drove me crazy with lust. My hands explored my little girl's slick, naked form as we slowly ground our sex together. I could hear every sound our sloppy, slippery loins made as easily as I could hear the heavy breathing between both of us. By this point, any apprehension I'd felt about this affair, about fucking my own offspring—flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood—had been erased completely. Just as I had when she was a child, I now worshipped my daughter—only this time, it was because of her luscious body moreso than her unparalleled genius.

""Don't forget to cum inside me, Daddy,"" Rhonda told me as I licked eagerly on her buoyant breast. ""You've been slacking off in that department lately, and I would really hate to punish you. Need I remind you that this is baby-making season?""

She knew what that would do to me. I grunted, gripped her tightly in my arms until our bodies were mashed firmly together, crushing her pillowy tits onto my chest. Then, I turned and slammed her onto her bed. I just threw her down like she was a rag, and she moaned excitedly. Her eyes were glazed with pure lust as I pounced and forced her thighs apart. She yelped in feigned helplessness as I grasped her heels and pushed them as far back as I could, nearly parallel to her shoulders.

I leaned my full weight into her, bending her legs so far back that her knees touched the mattress with every downstroke. I plunged my cock into her without gentleness or compassion. I just started to fuck her mercilessly, pounding my shaft deep into her while she hung onto my neck, screaming and moaning as I took her forcefully, punishing her tight little cunt.

It was her own damn fault with that last line she spoke. If there was anything that I loved more than fucking a pussy, it was cumming inside of one. Seeding one. And Rhonda's threats of 'punishment' as she called it, only enticed me further. After years of this, I had begun to feel a perverse pleasure in my daughter's control. For years, Rhonda had coerced me into sex by threatening me and my family with bodily harm and blackmail—and I

loved

it. It made it 'okay' for me to feel release. I wasn't just fucking my daughter, I was 'saving' my wife's life. I wasn't just filling my little girl with spunk, I was 'protecting' my family. I wasn't just making a hot little bitch pregnant, I was making a 'sacrifice' for everything I loved.

And gradually, methodically, Ronnie had broken me. My little girl had turned me into her willing pet, ready to do her bidding at her command.

She had already carried two of my children to term. Only weeks earlier, Ronnie had given birth to our second child, so now I knew it was time to get to work on our third one. Even though I knew it was twisted, I couldn't help feeling excitement at that. Months before, my wife Eileen also gave birth to a couple of twins, but because their gestation and labor had taken a huge toll on her, the doctors didn't recommend that she get pregnant again. Eileen went on birth control until she'd eventually get her tubes tied. When Rhonda heard, she was jubilant beyond belief.

""No more substandard brats from The Bitch, then,"" she had told me with a massive smile on her face. ""I want you to support her on this, Daddy. I never thought I'd say this, but it's probably the smartest decision she's ever made in her pathetic life.""

I really hated when Ronnie talked about her mother like that, but I couldn't talk back to her—not during 'silent time'. It was then that I was only allowed to nod and listen or else Rhonda would punish me. Rhonda usually invoked silent time when she needed to demand sex from me without my consent (which, believe me, was occurring less and less) or when she had something to say, but silent time didn't always involve sex.

Sometimes, Rhonda just wanted to spend time with me. She loved to talk to me about what new discoveries, interests, and happenings were developing in her world as a budding microbiologist. In a twisted sense, it was just like how things had been when she was a child, when she used to teach me things that her vastly superior intellect had discovered. Rhonda had been born a genius—her IQ tested at over 140 when she was very young, but I honestly believe that she was still holding back. Ronnie was so smart, she had never really been my ""child"" in a sense—I was only able to mentor her until she was about four and from that point on, her intellect vastly eclipsed mine. Still, I took it upon myself to study with her anyway, because I loved the feeling of pride I got at having such a brilliant baby girl.

Although Rhonda was a little emotionally distant to most people, she

always

beamed at me and eagerly enjoyed spending her time with me. In those days, I thought it was just because she wanted to make her Daddy happy, but after we began fucking, I started to wonder if that had ever been the real reason. In any case, let me restate that Rhonda didn't always just use her control to enforce sex from me. She also wanted my love and my approval; to have someone to share her gifts with. Just like the old days, I didn't understand ninety-percent of what she talked about, but she simply adored my efforts to try

.

But the difference between then and now was that she wasn't just little ""Rhonda Scott"" anymore. To the world outside of our home, she was

Doctor

Rhonda Scott, brilliant virologist.

Aside from her genius, Ronnie was fit, gorgeous, charismatic and

very

successful. Every one of her scientific peers loved her, and men just couldn't stay away from her. Ronnie always put on airs that she was a slut, and she loved teasing and flirting with men of all ages and personalities. But, Ronnie wasn't actually interested in any of them. It was all part of her cover, you see, to explain why she kept finding herself knocked up with no fathers for her babies. Sometimes, she even hired men to date and claim to have fucked her, without anyone having a clue that they were just escorts.

No matter how many men—successful entrepreneurs, lawyers, scientists, and doctors—propositioned her, Ronnie would come home and slide herself down on my cock and tell me I was the only man in the world that she loved. As sick as it might sound, that never failed to make me cum

hard

. What man wouldn't want to see a sexy woman with those kinds of credentials snub every other guy that headed her way and then crawl into bed with him?

And Ronnie was still my little girl. I hated seeing the way those lechers pawed at her, treating her like some cheap bimbo. She always purred her satisfaction when she noticed my possessiveness and savored the fact that I had totally surrendered to the taboo of an illicit affair with my eldest child. She constantly reminded me how much of a dirty pervert I was for letting her make my cock hard and she called me an 'incestuous bastard' just before I loosed my streams of cum into her womb.

To her credit, Ronnie was also a fantastic mother. She adored our children—which I was forced to pretend were my

grandchildren

(which they were, now that I think of it)—and thought that they were the greatest things she'd ever made. That was saying something, considering how much she'd accomplished in the scientific community. I, of course, loved our children, but equally to the other three that I legitimately had with my wife, Eileen. All of them meant the world to me, regardless who their mother was. But Rhonda hated her siblings. She

pretended

to be a good big sister to them, but in reality, she hated them every bit as much as she hated her mother, regardless of how much I begged otherwise.

""I just can't, Daddy. I just can't see any of your magnificence in them. The Bitch's putrid womb destroyed any trace of that, and now they're nothing more than horrid abominations. Not like

our

babies, Daddy. The ones I make for you will be

pure

and

untainted.

""

It was no use. No matter how much I pleaded, Rhonda would never forgive Eileen for the mistake she'd made which had once nearly destroyed our family. Ronnie made an effort to act as a loving daughter, but only to avoid suspicion. And only to make me happy. In private, every word she spoke about her mother was slathered in malice and acrimony.

""I know that I'm bad, Daddy, and that part of you really hates me, even if you

really

like everything else we do."" As she tended to do during times like this, she just stood up and pulled her skirt down to her ankles, lifting her blouse and bending over in front of a wall. She looked so obscene: here was my beautiful daughter, the prodigious Dr. Rhonda Scott, pointing her round ass toward her father's bulging crotch.

""I'm so mean to you, Daddy. I hurt you and hurt you, and I can't stop. But, it's not my fault. I came from inside

her,

so I'm ruined, Daddy. I need you to punish me."" That's what always she claimed, but most pretense of this being 'punishment' usually faded quickly. ""Tell me what a bad girl I am. Tell me much you hate me. Come on, Daddy. Let it all out.

Hurt me.

I promise you'll feel better!""

I took my belt off and spent the next twenty minutes turning her ass cheeks rosy. Rhonda whimpered, cried and moaned, and eventually I was just too hard to continue. I dropped my own pants and fucked her against the wall until I came in her pussy, and she turned her head, gazing into my eyes with pure amorous hunger. Her hot breath tickled my lips as I pressed deep, and she kissed me deeply in appreciation. She ground her ass against me to coax out every drop of my seed that she could.

She was right. I

did

feel better.

Since the Scott family had recently expanded from three to eight in the past few years, Rhonda voluntarily bought a new place for our entire family to live in, nice and secluded from the rest of society. Though it forced me to change jobs and forced Eileen to move to a different branch of the public library, the new house made it much easier for all of us to find living space.

And much easier for Rhonda and I to fuck each other like crazy.

For the most part, I was fucking her in the ""hot rooms""—the place where no one in the family was allowed to go without Rhonda's permission. This was where she kept all of her notes, books, and materials needed for working at home. It was essentially a wing of the house which served as a combination of a workshop, rec room, lab, and extra bedroom. Ronnie had seen to it that it was equipped with extra living quarters, just in case she needed to pull some all-nighters with in her important, ground-breaking research.

""YES, FUCK ME, DADDY! POUND ME HARDER!! DESTROY MY TIGHT, WET PUSSY!! FLOOD ME WITH YOUR SPUNK AND IMPREGNATE ME!!""

. . . Or if she needed her Daddy to fuck her stupid.

And so, there we were again, with my daughter making as much noise as she dared as we fucked in the confines of the soundproof rooms Dr. Rhonda Scott had bought and paid for. I leaned into her hard and growled like a demon possessed as I put forth extra effort to get every last pint of jizz into her waiting womb. Rhonda screamed in ecstasy and cried ""Oh Yes! Oh Yes!"" as she felt my hot juices washing her insides. Not for the first time, I gave in to the pure bliss of knowing that it was my daughter's cunt I was trying to impregnate. I knew it was nasty, but I didn't care. I knew it was wrong, but I still loved it.

And God help me, I didn't want to stop.

******

-EILEEN-

My husband is cheating on me, and I can't prove it. But I

know

it's true.

My name is Eileen Scott and I'm writing this just so that I don't go utterly mad. I don't intend for anybody to really read this, and I'm not really much of a writer, so I really hope you aren't expecting too much out of this. Oh geez, I just used the word 'really' three times in one sentence didn't I? Anyway, yeah . . . there's a clear example of my profound writing ability. David is the English major in our family, not me, so forgive my limited vocabulary. But I just have to get this out of me.

It's been driving me crazy every single day, and I'm afraid that I'm going to lose my husband. I've been married to him for almost 24 years now. We have four wonderful children, and two beautiful grandchildren. Our oldest girl, Rhonda, is a doctor now, and our family's finally climbed out of the money problems we'd been drowning in for a long, long time. I work at the public library and David works in sales. Neither of us really make a whole lot of money and, hell, we've never even had savings or a 'rainy day' fund. For most our lives, we could be safely classified as ""poor white trash"".

But things are exceptionally good for us now. We've gone from upper-lower to upper-middle class, our financial future is secure, our brilliant daughter is one of the most renowned researchers in medical science, and my husband fucks me almost every night until I'm well satisfied.

So why do I feel that something is terribly,

terribly

wrong?

And worse, I'm worried that it's all my fault. I fear that I once made a horrible mistake that drove a rift into my family, and though I've tried for years to make up for it and mend that rift, I don't think I'll ever truly succeed.

I met my husband David when we were both teenagers, and I immediately knew I was going to marry him. The two of us both wanted the same things—a house, kids and old age together, and we dedicated everything in our lives to making that dream happen. We both agreed not to let our egos, hangups, or our careers get in the way of that goal. Our first and only priority was living in matrimonial harmony, and we made a

lot

of sacrifices. For example, David lost his job at a multinational corporation because they wanted to move us, and I couldn't go.

Both of suffered a lot to be together, but what we wanted more than anything was to love each other until we were both gray and wrinkled. That dream made both of us happy.

I became pregnant with our first child a few years after our wedding, and it was great to see how pleased David was as my belly grew. I felt like the luckiest woman in the world watching him fawn over me while I was carrying our firstborn. As my body started going through changes and my hormones grew unbalanced, I became quite a bitch, but David took every bit of it in stride. He loved me unconditionally, and he was there when I finally gave birth to our daughter Rhonda. The night he and I held her for the first time is still one of my favorite memories.

Rhonda was a bright child. No . . . 'bright' isn't doing it justice. Rhonda was a

genius

. And that's not an exaggeration. Her IQ was off the charts, and when most children were only learning how to spell 'd-u-c-k', Rhonda was able to recite the entire US Constitution off the top of her head. I'll be honest: it freaked me out, seeing how quickly she could grasp even the most complicated subject, and it wasn't long before her intelligence started to eclipse both my husband and myself. Ironically, despite me working in a library, David was the one with the penchant for literature, so he and Rhonda used to read together and discuss. But soon it became clear that David was only going through the motions and that Rhonda's intellect had grown far beyond his as well.

I convinced David to find some mentorship for Rhonda, despite the fact that we could barely afford it. A professor from some university used to come by four days of the week and tutor Rhonda and she earned a full college degree by the time she was eleven. David was immensely proud and would brag to everyone about our little 'prodigy'. He spoiled that girl rotten and treated her as if she was queen of the universe.

Me on the other hand? Something about Rhonda just didn't sit right.

The first time I thought something was wrong happened when she was four. During that summer, we had a problem with birds slamming into the plexiglass door leading from the kitchen to the back yard, and the constant banging was driving me nuts. Occasionally, it would even be the same damn bird slamming into it over and over. You'd think that after the first time, it'd learn its lesson, but nooooo.

One day, I happened to come across Rhonda, who heard the thump and went to go investigate. There, she found an injured bird out back that was obviously stunned after hitting its head on the plexi. Rhonda went outside and scooped the bird in her arms, cradling it gently, with motherly care. I knew that bird was probably filthy, but I decided to watch my little girl to see what she would do. Watching her care for such a timid little creature tickled my heart.

But to my immediate shock and horror, Ronnie went to the kitchen drawer and removed a pair of hefty scissors and then got ready to cut one of the wings off the bird. I immediately ran into the room and grabbed her wrist, putting the scissors back in the drawer and tossing the bird out of the back door. Rhonda just looked at me, confused and upset.

""What are you doing, Mommy!?"" she asked me in a very monotone voice. The way she asked me it was like she wasn't confused but just . . . angry.

""That's

my

line!"" I snapped at her. ""Why were you going to hurt that bird!?""

She looked at me like I was an idiot. ""I wasn't going to hurt it. I was helping it."" With my mouth hung in utter astonishment, she continued.

""You and Daddy were complaining that the birds don't learn their lesson when they fly into the glass, right? Well, if they can't fly anymore, then they don't

have

to learn! Problem solved!""

I was completely befuddled. Was this normal logic for a four-year-old?!

I decided to explain the problem with her theory, as rationally as I could. ""But hurting things doesn't really solve their problems, darling. Making mistakes and not learning from them is bad, but if you hurt someone just to teach them a lesson then you're not improving anything.""

Rhonda stared at me with a blank face. Then, a few seconds later, she said, ""That's stupid.""

For my new readers, first let me extend a hearty welcome. Second, let me explain this story a bit. This is the third installment of my Daddy's Little Psychopath series.

Chapter One can be found here

and

Chapter Two can be found here

. You can expect this story to contain the following tags: cuckquean, father-daughter incest, mother-daughter incest, rough sex, reluctance, and blackmail. If that isn't your cup of tea, you can try most of my other series, as they are quite different from this one.

This story picks up where Chapter Two left off, but backtracks a bit to explain what happened after Eileen discovered her husband's affair with their daughter. Like before, this story switches perspectives between the protagonists quite a bit.

Addendum to editors: This story does not contain any scenes of explicit sex with characters under the legal age of consent.

-EILEEN-

""Now that we understand each other, listen to me very carefully . . .""

My heart was pounding as I listened to my daughter's voice on the other end. I heard the spite and hate slathered on every word she spoke, and my memory was drawn back to everything she'd said and done over the past decade or so. It wasn't easy for me to accept, but the reality that I faced told me Rhonda had been keeping her true feelings hidden from me that entire time. Every time she smiled at me . . . every time we hugged . . . every present she bought for my birthday . . . every time we had girl talk . . . and every single time she said 'I love you' . . . it was all a lie.

The harsh truth was that Rhonda, my own daughter, considered me to be the worst scum on the planet and didn't care whether I lived or died.

""The first thing that I want you to do is go home, hug your husband, tell him how much you love him . . . and then fuck him stupid,"" she told me. ""You have no idea how much I hate telling you that. You really don't. Hell, you don't even deserve him, you know. Every night that he spends in bed with you is an absolute waste an amazing man with a fabulous cock. In fact, I bet you don't even know what to do with it. I bet you didn't even know that your husband likes having his cock and balls scratched, did you?""

When I didn't answer immediately, Ronnie spat: ""I asked you a question, Bitch.""

""N-No, Ronnie, I didn't,"" I answered sincerely, my voice trembling.

""Heh. I found that out after only fucking him for a few months. And how long have you two been married? Twenty-four years, isn't it? Two dozen years of marriage and you still don't even understand how to turn your own husband on and fully satisfy him.""

I sobbed unintentionally. I had tried not to let Rhonda understand how much her words truly hurt me, but it was almost impossible to hide. I knew what she said was true, and it made me feel so pathetic. David had always satisfied me sexually, but I'd never been the adventurous sort in bed. David never asked me about doing anything to spice up our loving, and he had never expressed any sort of dissatisfaction, so I never knew that he had these other fetishes or turn-ons. Even twenty-four years later, David and I had never so much as tried anal sex before.

Even worse, during the three years David and Rhonda had been fucking each other, my sex life with him had become more healthy than ever. David was insatiable now; even if we made love to each other until compelte exhaustion during the night, he would be ready and willing again first thing in the morning. David was a complete

beast

in bed now, and had been for the past several years. At first, I'd hoped that it was because of some sort of mid-life hormones or something, but now, the truth of it had become clear to me. The reason my husband's libido had suddenly exploded was because our younger, nubile daughter was pushing him to the absolute brink.

Was that really the power Ronnie held over him? Was she really

that much

better than me?

""So, like I said, I want you to go home and fuck your husband and tell him that you'd never even

think

of leaving his side. Tell him that our fucking doesn't bother you in the least Tell him that you love him more than life itself. Tell him that horses can fly and dinosaurs lived on the moon. Whatever. I don't care what you say to him, so long as you make it clear that you're staying. I want Daddy to be completely happy. When he realizes that he gets to fuck both his wife and his daughter without reservation, I want him to feel like the luckiest man on Earth.

""You have one hour to get home and do what I told you, Bitch, but my instructions for you don't end there. This weekend, Daddy is taking the kids to a ballgame, and you and I will have the house all to ourselves. Whatever plans you had, you're going to cancel them and report to my 'hot rooms'. You're now a part of this new life, whether you want to be or not.""

Her voice then plunged to icy, emotionless depths, and every part of my body immediately went stiff.

""And if you don't do exactly as I've told you, if you

dare

try to ruin things between Daddy and me, I will destroy your fucking life one step at a time.""

She hung up, and left me standing inside of the mall, my entire world suddenly ripped out from beneath my feet.

From just that brief conversation, I immediately understood why David had come to be dominated by her. Rhonda had a way of commanding authority; she didn't just ask you to do something, she

commanded

you. She didn't merely outline her plans to you, she told you specifically how things were going to be. She told you your very place in life. The mere tone of her voice invoked fear, and it was only after experiencing it that I realized how frozen in complete terror I had been. If this is what David had been putting up with for close to three years, then he had never stood a chance.

No longer having a reason to stick around the mall, I headed straight for my car and started the engine. Rhonda had instructed me that I had an hour to get home, and I wanted to get there as soon as possible. I didn't know how Rhonda had figured out David's plan, but it was obvious that she was monitoring me in some way. It'd be dangerous to linger or dawdle anywhere—Rhonda might very well assume that I was trying to find a way to sell her out.

As I drove home, a number of things went through my mind. First amongst them was jealousy. Parents are supposed to be proud of their children and celebrate when they accomplish more than they ever could, right? Yet I couldn't feel anything but pain and envy at the idea that my daughter was simply better at everything that mattered to me. She was the main provider for our family, she was vastly more intelligent than me, she was far more youthful and beautiful than me . . .

. . . And she satisfied my husband sexually better than I did.

Somehow, even with all of this on my mind, I kept it together and tucked it out of my head when I got home. I ran right to a shocked David and threw my arms around him. I did exactly what Rhonda had told me to do: I sold the idea that I didn't care if they were intimate, so long as he loved me and we could be together. I tried to force myself to believe every word, because otherwise I wasn't sure my lies would convince David, either. It seemed to work, though, as David quickly scooped me into his arms and carried me to our bed. He undressed me quickly and pushed me on top of the mattress.

It had been a while since David had licked or sucked my pussy, but he did it eagerly this time. He gently pushed my thighs apart with his hands and buried his lips and tongue into my mound. I was cumming in seconds as my husband's tongue rubbed animatedly against my clit, and my backed arced while I screamed in orgasm. David's lips touched my thighs, and he ran his hot, wet tongue along my legs until I was soaking the sheets with my pussy juices.

Part of me wanted to think: ""How much of this has Rhonda taught him? How many times did she make him do this until he not only became good at it, but enjoyed it?"" The thought that my husband's sexual appetite was a result of his affair with our daughter should have killed my mood, but it didn't. My mind was completely overtaken by lust, and all I could think about was how good this felt. It was hard to care about where David had learned this or who had taught him when he was so damn good at it. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and I begged him to mount me.

David did exactly as I pleaded, and within a minute, he had thrust his gorgeous cock inside me and was pressing his hard body atop mine while he ground away. My arms held him close, and my hands explored his back, noticing for the first time the scratches and claw marks that had undoubtedly been put there by our daughter's rough fingernails. A few of the wounds still seemed fresh, and David often groaned savagely and lustfully as I stroked one. It was hurting him, but it made him fuck me harder. The process was automatic, almost like instinct. The more physical pain I caused him, the much more intense the fucking was.

Rhonda, you magnificent bitch,

I thought.

David pressed his lips to mine and our tongues wrestled as his cock stayed inside me, the erect girth sliding against my moist tunnel. I had lost count of the number of times David had made me cum, and I begged him not to stop. David kept up a vigorous pace for well over half an hour before either of us even began to tire.

His body began to shudder, and I knew his orgasm was coming. I held him close and yelled, ""Do it, baby! Cum in my pussy! I want to feel you! Please, honey!""

On command, David came inside me, and I felt his potent cum rushing inside, filling me and searching for a way to make me pregnant. Unfortunately, I had been using birth control for quite some time, and my doctor wanted me to get tied. I'd already had four children—twins most recently—and my body wasn't capable of delivering anymore without health concerns. It would simply be too risky for both myself and a child if I got pregnant again, so I would never be able to bear my husband another child.

But that's okay, because our daughter can take care of that for him.

That stray thought made me gasp. Why did I just think that? How could I possibly get myself to think that my husband impregnating our daughter was 'okay'?

Jesus, what was wrong with me?

******

-DAVID-

The night before, my wife and I made love until neither of us could move. We lay in each others' arms the entire night, and I'd never felt more loved or secure.

Then, the following morning, my daughter slipped into the bathroom while I showered, and I fucked her against the shower wall until I came deep in her pussy. But even after we 'cleaned ourselves', the two of us were only more turned on, so my baby girl told me to follow her to her bedroom, where pounded her pussy long and hard for over an hour until my cum flooded inside her once again.

Afterward, I came out to find my wife fixing breakfast, so I walked up to her and kissed her on the cheek as we summoned our entire family for their meal.

So, to recap, I spent the night making love to my devoted wife, woke the next day and fucked my daughter, and then sat down to eat breakfast with them and all of our children.

Would I be a bad guy if I admitted to

loving

this arrangement?

It had been about a week since I confessed to my wife about my affair with my daughter, and to my utter surprise, Eileen decided to stay with me. I gave her the opportunity to leave—to free herself from Rhondas trap—but she chose to stay. Because she loves me, she said. And as long as I loved her, she could share me with Rhonda. That I could have both of them, if I wished to.

Dear Lord, I was in Heaven. Just what have I ever done to earn this?

Until that day, I had been wracked by guilt whenever I looked into my wife's eyes and lied to her. But now that she knew the truth, I felt more compelled to prove my love to her than ever. I understood the sacrifice she was making, and I wanted to show my appreciation with all of my heart. With Rhonda, there was sex, but no true romance. Oh sure, I loved Rhonda in a sense. She was my brilliant daughter, my gorgeous and sexy lover, and the mother of half of my children. My mind went blank whenever she stripped and showed off her luscious tits, her perfect hips, and her heart-shaped ass. Rhonda was the vision of feminine perfection, and she never fails to drive me crazy with lust . . .

. . . But she could never,

ever

, replace Eileen in my heart.

Being in the situation I had been in for the past three years really changed the way I thought. Until recently, I'd never really thought of the differences between lust and love . . . between sex and love-making. I'd always thought that they were just words that meant roughly the same thing . . . but now, with two lovers to look after, I was beginning to form a different outlook. Looking between the two of them, I could understand the difference.

I loved them both, in different ways. And I lusted after them both, for different reasons.

The thing that worried me most was that, without me, the two of them were completely incompatible. By now, it was no secret that Rhonda absolutely hated her mother, and there was no mistaking the mix of fear and resentment on Eileen's face whenever she glanced at our daughter. I was living in a house with two tigresses who wanted to claw each others' eyes out, and the only thing that held them both back was their mutual desire for me.

It didn't take a genius to see how this was a ticking time bomb.

Now, unless you've in this situation yourself, this may simply sound petty and selfish, but . . . I knew I could never give up either one of them. Both of them completed me in different ways, and the loss of either would be devastating. It was far too late for things to go back to what they once had been—and I wouldn't have wanted them to even if it were possible. I wanted things to move

forward

, not backward. I wanted progress, not regress.

But what could I do?

How could I keep two feuding lovers happy without choosing between either of them?

In the end, I concluded that the key was

Ronnie.

Eileen, for whatever reason, had chosen to stay with me, and she was doing her best to put up with what our daughter and I did. Eileen was making an incredible sacrifice—not just for me, but for our entire family—so I knew it wouldn't be fair to ask anything more of her.

Rhonda, on the other hand . . .

-EILEEN-

The rest of the week was somewhat uneventful, other than the big lie that permeated through our household.

I knew about Rhonda's affair with David, but

he

didn't know that Rhonda was aware that he'd told me. Rhonda had then instructed me to keep secret about that knowledge to David. So, I had to lie to my husband while at the same time he and I lied to Rhonda. If you're having trouble following, don't worry about it—it was an utter nightmare for me to keep straight as well. All you need to understand was that Rhonda was the puppet-master behind everything. And, genius that she was, she never seemed to have trouble keeping it all straight herself. So, for the most part, I just tried to follow her lead.

But, I'll be honest: that first week—when David and Rhonda would disappear for hours at a time . . . when Rhonda would walk by in her slutty outfit and David would unconsciously turn his eyes to leer at her . . . when Rhonda would cast me triumphant, knowing smirks every time our eyes met--it was hard. It did horrible things to my psyche every time I realized that my husband and daughter were off somewhere fucking while I was in the basement doing their laundry or while I was looking after the kids. I felt like

I

was the concubine, tending to Mistress and Master's needs while they did as they pleased with each other.

I felt like the lesser person, despite being a woman who had been dutifully married to her husband for over two decades.

There were times when I just wanted to scream or break down and cry, but I couldn't do anything that would shatter my act. Mostly, I tried to make up for it at night when David and I were alone together. As always, David was magnificent in bed, and sex was becoming a narcotic for me now—every problem I had seemed to melt away when I was making love to my husband. It was the one thing that kept me going.

******

Eventually, the weekend finally came, and just as Ronnie had said, David took all of the kids—yes, all five of them—to a baseball game with his buddies and their families. It was an outing had been planned for weeks, but I'd elected not to go because I hate sporting events. I thought it was a bit strange that a man would be willing to take five children to a ballgame on his own, but now that I knew how manipulative Rhonda could be, I had to wonder how much of it had been

her

idea.

When they were all gone, and the house was empty, I honored my deal to meet her inside of her secret little den, what she called the 'hot rooms'. They were a section of the house to which Rhonda had barred all access. Since it was Dr. Rhonda Scott, the successful and wealthy virologist, who'd bought this house, there were several places she always kept locked. However, on this day, I found them unlocked, and for the first time, I was able to see what the inside of Rhonda's secret area looked like.

Honestly, it was almost like a complete home, in its own right. There was a kitchen, a bathroom, an entire area for recreation and exercise . . . and a bedroom. It was impossible not to notice the queen-size platform bed, ready-made for two individuals to share comfortably. Though it was made up tidily as I passed by, I could definitely smell the pungent aroma of sex inside; it then occurred to me that David hadn't been in bed when I woke up this morning, and his side had been cold enough for me to realize that he'd slipped away hours before. I hadn't actually seen him again until just before breakfast.

A chilling question entered my mind. Had Rhonda ""summoned"" him here, or had David simply left my side in the middle of the night because he developed a sudden craving for our daughter's pussy? Had my David willingly abandoned my side just to sneak off and fuck her? I tried hard not to think of it, doing my best to hold my emotions.

I would

not

give Rhonda the satisfaction.

Eventually, I reached an area which seemed something like a library. Rhonda had always loved books; it was David's insistence upon reading to her at a young age that had first caused them to bond. With Rhonda's IQ, she was capable of understanding even the most complicated subject matter very quickly, so I had no doubt in my mind that she'd read each one of the hundreds of wall-to-wall books inside the room.

After that, I entered one final door which led to a steep staircase leading downward. I was quickly swallowed by darkness as I descended the steps, with only a soft, artificial glow keeping things lit enough for me to see.

At last, I found Rhonda, seated behind a desk adorned with a complicated web of computers, monitors, and all sorts of digital equipment that I have no expertise in. All of this equipment had to have cost Rhonda a fortune, and I couldn't even guess at how much the electricity or network costs ran. Even Rhonda, with the money she made as a doctor and virologist, should have been bled dry just to maintain an operation on this type of scale . . .

. . . unless she had

another

source of income.

Seated with her legs crossed and out on display, she was dressed in a very sexy silk robe which she hadn't even attempted to tie in the front. As such, her ample breasts were on full display, along with the rest of her cream-colored body and skin. On her otherwise bare feet, Rhonda wore a pair of heeled slippers which she allowed to hang off halfway from the foot draped on top.

Greetings, readers. First an apology.

Sorry I've been away for so long. I've been working on other writing projects (trying to turn my long-unfinished novel into a FINISHED novel) and issues with my personal life have kept me busy. That doesn't mean I have given up on you or that I'm abandoning Literotica. I love you guys, and I would never do that. You can count on me to continue writing by hook or by crook.

Now for my new readers: this is the third installment of my Daddy's Little Psychopath series.

Chapter One can be found here

,

Chapter Two can be found here

and

Chapter Three can be found here

. You can expect this story to contain the following tags: cuckquean, father-daughter incest, mother-daughter incest, rough sex, reluctance, and blackmail. If that isn't your cup of tea, you can try most of my other series, as they are quite different from this one.

Please, please, please leave a comment below. I can't stress enough how much feedback helps me write.

***

Addendum to editors: This story does not contain any scenes of explicit sex with characters under the legal age of consent (18).

******

I let Daddy pour all of rich, creamy seed into me while I held him close and breathed into his ear, both of our bodies slick and glistened with sweat. He always felt deliciously warm after spending all of energy to seed me. The scent of our combined sex hit me already; the incestuous cocktail between my legs, oozing from my cunt even as my father's cock stay lodged within.

I licked his ear, a sign of appreciation for demonstrating how much he loved me. Then, my eyes fell upon the mirror in front. I gazed at myself, conjoined with my father on the countertop of tiny room, my legs spread wide for him, his ass thrust deeply between them, and my hair ragged and chaotic like a freshly-fucked whore.

I preserved it to my memory. My near-perfect, eidetic memory. The best part about being a genius wasn't just being smarter than everyone else or getting people to do anything I wanted—it was the fact that I could recall moments like this in almost flawless detail. To date, I still had the memory of the first time I fucked my father tucked away in my special place. He was helpless in bed, paralyzed by the virus I'd poisoned him with; I forced him to empty his balls into my cunt even though he was delirious with a fever. It was

amazing.

But this image was even more special. As always, the sex was fantastic, and Daddy had become well-trained at pleasuring me. But, the true excitement came from gazing into our reflection, knowing that if I could see this image . . . then so could The Bitch.

She was there. On the other side of the ""mirror"", watching us. Everything I could see in the glass before me, she could see from the next room. She could see her husband pumping his semen into my cunt. She could hear him crying out with greater joy than she could ever give him. Yes, that's exactly what 'she' would see.

My 'mother'.

I hated to even use that word to describe her. She wasn't a mother; she was proof that genetics have a sense of humor. The only reason any competent God would have created her was so that she could give birth to her far superior replacement:

me.

But that was also the very reason why I am an atheist; that same God should have been smart enough to know that the world would be a better place if only she'd died in childbirth.

""Ooooo, thank you for fucking me, Daddy,"" I whispered into his ear just before I kissed his soft and masculine lips. He responded in kind, and we shared time exploring one-anothers' mouths as his hands roamed everywhere. My skin was always extra sensitive post-coitus, and he took

full

advantage. He seemed proud, confident, his male ego reassured when his daughter thanked him for plowing her tight pussy. I had Daddy wrapped around my finger, and I wanted

her

to see it.

Eventually, Daddy went limp and pulled out. I stayed in my spread position, reclined on the counter like a wanton slut. I pushed a finger into my pussy to coax as much of his cum out of me as possible. I wanted her to see that too. Her spouse's cum pouring out of me, just in case she had forgotten in the past couple seconds.

Hey, she's a moron. They do things like that.

*****

After Daddy left, I floated from the counter and exited myself. I went the opposite way we come, and wound up in the dark, empty room where The Bitch was. I clicked the light switch and brought the room to full illumination.

""How did you like the show?"" I asked her, probing for a response. ""How did you like seeing your husband fucking me so handsomely?""

She panted and swallowed. ""I . . . I . . .""

I smiled. ""Did you

enjoy

it?""

""Oh, God . . ."" she sobbed. Good. The aphrodisiac was doing its job. Contrary to myth, they don't work like magic love potions, making someone immediately fall head-over-heels. It takes time. Back when I was eighteen, I began wearing my own chemical mix of pollen, vanilla extract, and my own cum. Whenever I was near Daddy, I would let him get a good whiff even as I bombarded him from all sides with seduction. It took a long time to get him to become

instantly

hard in my presence, but the wait was worth it.

The concoction I used for the bitch was different, but her reaction was much quicker. Quicker than even

I

expected.

I slowly unfastened her restraints, allowing her to move as she wished. She remained still, trying to catch her breath. Trying to make sense of the mixture of emotion that must have been flooding through her.

She still needed a little . . . guidance. So once her binds were released, my pussy parked right next to her face as she turned toward me with wide eyes.

""It's intoxicating, isn't it?"" I asked her. ""The cream Daddy pumped into me makes such a delightful mixture with my own cum, doesn't it? Doesn't it look and smell so

inviting?

""

She swallowed deeply as she watched it oozing from between my legs. She didn't provide an answer.

""Go on,"" I spoke to her like an infant. ""Taste it if you want. It's alright.""

I could tell that she was confused. Did she really want to do this? Would this make

me

happy? I simply held my cunt open and waited, meeting her eyes with an expectant stare.

When her hand reached for my pussy, I smacked it away. ""No, no. Use your tongue

only

. Come on, 'Mommy-dearest'. Get a good tasting of Daddy and me's

'special recipe'.

""

She hesitated and looked up at me. I only gazed at her expectantly. I didn't waiver my eye contact. I was in control, and she knew it.

She leaned forward and poked her tongue out, gently touching the folds of my pussy, where the gooey gobs of Daddy's cream were still oozing out. I felt her wet tongue tickling my moist flesh, and I moaned without realizing.

I grasped the top of her head tightly and trusted it her face into my sex. I held her in place, with no chance to escape. I pushed my hips forward to meet her lips.

My mother began lapping at my pussy, gobbling up all of the cum Daddy had dumped into me—tasting for herself how good his juice was when mixed with mine.

My free hand roamed across my naked front, drifting from my swollen, milk-laden breasts and the bulbous belly which held my Daddy's baby. I saw her eyes glance up to notice it once, and she immediately invoked a shiver. She moaned softly as I pushed her mouth deeper into my cunt.

She'd just realized that the exact concoction she was eating was exactly what had created the grandchild in my belly. The thought of it made her cum instantly.

""Alright, you can stop now,"" I told her, pushing her away. I made sure to separate her from me right at the cusp of her orgasm, and just for a moment, I saw her glance at me with disappointment.

""I hope you enjoyed the show, 'Mommy',"" I said to her, stepping away. ""I wanted to you to fully appreciate where your place in this family was going to be from now on. I wanted to see it with your own eyes.""

Her eyes filled with tears as I left her with those words. I wasn't quite sure what part of her that statement had cut the most, but it really didn't matter. Seeing the The Bitch on the floor, utterly broken, with her face dribbling the cum her husband had left in my pussy . . .

. . . The feeling made me cum again.

******

I didn't do anything

too

sinister for the next few days. Mostly, I would just lightly brush my arms or fingers across Daddy's chest, buttocks or shoulder when I passed him, and note the look in The Bitch's face as she watched him react to it. I wanted her to know that I owned him, just like I now owned everyone and everything else in this house. I could make him dance at my whims, and there was nothing she could do about it. Every now and again, I even called to Daddy from another room and beckoned him to me, making him jump to me like a puppy as I whisked him into our special place.

I knew I was skirting the ""rules"" of our little game—threatening to let Daddy on that I knew his secret. But, I didn't care. The look of defeat in her eyes was well worth it.

I didn't even talk to the bitch directly again until several days afterward.

I handed her a list. ""Here you go, Bitch. Read it.""

She took the note from me and glanced at the names and phone numbers upon it. Of course, she didn't understand what it was for.

""W-What is this?"" she asked me.

""Those are 'friends' of mine that you and Daddy are going to begin fucking.""

Her eyes nearly popped from her skull. ""T-There's at least twenty names here!""

""That's right, and you're going to fuck them all within the next month. You'll have to schedule for later in the evening, though. They won't be available to play until school lets out.""

Her eyes snapped to me. ""

School!?

Ronnie, how old are some of these—""

""Pay attention. I'm talking. Your question is irrelevant, anyway. You and Daddy are

going

to fuck them. Period.""

I licked my lips. ""Besides, all of them are just

aching

to fuck Daddy. You know how teen girls

love

older, distinguished men, don't you? I've chatted with each of them online, shown them Daddy's picture, and they're quite eager to bed him. Didn't you know what a catch your husband was? You

must

be aware that if you had been out of the picture, Daddy would have gotten all the young pussy he could ever want. Personally, I don't think he'd mind.

""But this won't be a one-man show, I'm afraid. Some of them were upset when I told them that a sag-chested hag like you was part of the package deal, but they'd do anything to get a man like Daddy to fuck them.

""Also, the deal was no condoms. They hate them. So, you're going to make good use of that little 'lesson' I gave you the other day, and you are going to lick the cum all of their pussies after Daddy finishes inside. I gave a glowing review of how good at it you were, and this was the only way we could come to terms.""

I could tell that she was upset, and

God

it made me so horny. If Daddy had been around, I would have fucked him in front of her right then. As it was, I couldn't help myself and started fingering myself while I looked at the anguish on her face.

""You . . . you want me to just whore out my husband?"" she asked me.

In truth, my original plan had been to whore out

both

of them, separately. It was all part of our little game. At first, I was going to have an entire varsity football team take turns on her, but Daddy had gone and made that stupid threat. He told me not to 'harm' her or make her 'unhappy'.

'Unhappy?!'

Hmph. I bet a whore like her would have come to like being gangraped; by the time every boy had his turn, she would've been begging them for more.

But I couldn't risk it now. I needed to make baby steps. My plans had changed so that I could play the game without breaking her.

In truth, it wouldn't be that difficult. And, actually, I was beginning to like

this

game better than the original one I had planned. It required more ingenuity—more

finesse.

But it still sucked.

I wanted to make this bitch suffer.

""As I recall, you

immensely

enjoyed the last time I arranged a threesome for the two of you,"" I responded, continuing to finger my clit. ""In fact, you enjoyed watching your husband pounding that young girl's pussy, and just as you did with he and I the other day.""

She swallowed. The reaction in her eyes was so predicable She was accepting the logic I fed to her.

It made me even wetter. God, the way someone's face changes when they know they're beaten . . .

I pulled the puppet's strings a little more. ""If you would like to, you can suck my clit right now until I come.""

Her eyes snapped to me. She knew how much I hated her; how unclean I thought she was, body and soul. I hated the thought of being near her stench, of being near the air she polluted with her presence. But, this was a special exception. When she suffers . . . when she realizes how pathetic she is, she's

beautiful

to me. And I without Daddy's cock nearby, I needed

something

to take care of my insatiable lust.

But the beauty of it was that I'd given her a

choice.

Step Two of Stockholm's Syndrome: when held captive by someone they fear, the hostage will do anything to make their captors see them as valuable. In their subconscious, they think it humanizes them in the captor's eyes. . . makes them harder to hurt if things turn for the worst.

She wasn't able to help herself. Ha. So gullible, like most idiots. People are sheep, waiting to be led either to the pasture or the slaughterhouse by their superior. I knew what her choice would be before even she did, and as I watched her fall to her knees and lean her head between my legs, my arousal only doubled.

""Come on, now. Lick your baby girl's juicy cunt.""

******

-DAVID-

I didn't know what Rhonda was planning anymore. I didn't have a clue in hell what her game was, but . . . God help me, I was starting not to care. I didn't think it was possible, but my sex drive had gotten even

higher

ever since I let Eileen in on our dirty little secret. Maybe Rhonda suspected that Eileen knows the truth and this was her way of reestablishing control . . . I had no idea. All I knew is that I'd never enjoyed so much pussy in my entire life, and I didn't know if I could stop if I wanted to.

Rhonda let me know that she would be ""renting"" my cock out. The way she explained it, there were a number of co-ed friends that would require fair payment for a few favors. Somehow, she convinced most of them that making use of my cock would square them, and the girls agreed. I didn't know how Rhonda pulled

that

off, and to be honest, it really didn't matter. All I knew was that for months, I got visit after visit from a long line of gorgeous teens who craved my cock.

Once again, the deal was that I needed to convince Eileen to participate. Unknown to Rhonda, I let my wife know right away that this was one of our daughter's schemes, but she didn't seem to pay that any heed. For whatever reason, Eileen was even more eager to go through with our group ""activites"" this time than before. If I didn't know any better, I could almost swear that Eileen had grown to love the taste of clit and the touch of another woman. God, I wanted that to be the case. It would kill me to think that she was doing this solely for my sake.

I dared not ask, though. I'd grown way too accustomed to my situation, for better or worse. Sex was like a drug for me now, and I was willing to shut up and do whatever Rhonda wanted me to, so long as I got more and more of it.

To my astonishment, Rhonda didn't show an ounce of jealousy regarding the other girls. They were younger than Ronnie, and some of them had larger busts, tighter asses, and fitter bodies. There were even a few exotic hotties here and there. I fucked at least three black co-eds, one Chinese, and one girl from Saudi Arabian. The latter one, incidentally, became my favorite out of the bunch. I had never known that a Middle Eastern woman could be such a whore. I'd always thought that it was against their religion or something. But this girl would do

anything

for my cock.

Rhonda didn't mind at all, and sometimes, I would even fuck her while she replayed some of my other sessions. It would turn us both on to watch me pump into some tight teen cunt for nearly half an hour and then empty my balls inside her. More than once, I would cum simultaneously both on the screen and inside my daughter's pussy. Rhonda screamed through an orgasm every time I did it, and I tended to lose every ounce of control.

This went on for

months.

Don't ask me how I managed to find the stamina to fuck a plethora of young girls, my daughter, and my wife just about every day. I have no idea how. But somehow, I did.

One day, I was fucking Rhonda from behind while she fast-forwarded through a video of myself, Eileen and Katy (the Arab girl). If I recall right, this was either the third or fourth time we had met with Katy, and one of the more intense sessions. While I fucked Katy on her hands and knees, she was screaming as my cock slid in and out of her eighteen-year-old pussy. She never shut up during the entire fucking, and it took Eileen sticking a nipple in her mouth to deafen the noise.

Whenever her mouth was free, Katy would be in tears, sobbing how much she loved my cock. How she couldn't believe how good I was. She told me that she would do anything for my cock. She would cook for me. She would clean for me. She'd quit school and have my babies.

God, how that turned me on. Do you have any idea what it does to a forty-something to hear a teen girl scream her love for his cock? To say that she'd be willing to throw her whole future away to have his babies?

As I watched it onscreen, I unconsciously reached down and scooped a hand under Rhonda's belly. By this time, Rhonda was more than seven months showing, but she looked closer to nine months. We'd found out, you see, that she was going to have triplets—a first for our family. Just hearing another woman screaming for me to impregnate her made me appreciative of the buns I already had growing in my daughter's oven. Rhonda still looked obscenely sexy as her belly widened with our children.

But, as she watched me fuck Katy on the television, Ronnie seemed transfixed by something.

""Mmmm, Daddy . . ."" she purred, ""you really did conquer that poor girl, didn't you?""

I only grunted my answer, too busy thrusting my hips hard into Ronnie's ass to be intelligible.

""I should be jealous, you know,"" she told me with a gasp, wriggling her pussy muscles so that they gripped my cock as tightly as a set of fingers. ""You fuck her different than you fuck me."" She forced me to slow my stride, but I responded by making the in-strokes harder than ever. Rhonda grunted her pleasure and I felt her heeled slippers rise to rub against my inner thigh.

But I didn't know how to respond. Rhonda sounded upset, but her actions were loving . . . affectionate. That was always the problem with Ronnie . . . her mood swings were too unpredictable. Saying the wrong thing right now would tick her off , and who knew what she'd do afterwards.

""What . . . what would you like me to do, Ronnie?"" I asked pleadingly.

She chuckled. ""Nothing, Daddy. I'm not upset. "" She turned to face me and caressed my face as I continued to fuck her. ""You can do with that slut whatever you want. I don't mind.""

-EILEEN-

In the past few weeks, David had begun to use the pool continuously. Almost overnight, he suddenly had a use for it, and our poolside had sprung to life once again after years of neglect. Except this time, David wasn't alone. It wasn't Ronnie that was joining him, either . . . it was . . . those

other

women.

Young girls, one after another. David began inviting them to our home and treating them to dips in our pool. For years, he'd been procrastinating to figure out how to make the Jacuzzi feature work, but he got it up and running in only a day just so that he could get those other floozies to come and take their tops off for him. First every other night, then practically every, David shared the pool with some hot young thing, and sometimes even two or three. One night, I came home from a late night at work to find David sitting out in the Jacuzzi with a redhead on one arm, a blonde in another, and that Katy girl sitting atop David's lap while facing him. I couldn't see anything below the surface of the water, but the look on David's face told me that his cock was inside her, and she was fucking him something good.

One of the other girls licked and nibbled on David's ear while the other stroked her hands all over his chest. It was obvious that my husband was in pure bliss, as he couldn't even keep his eyes focused. Katy's eyes were locked on his, and she often leaned forward to kiss him on the lips while she gently ground her hips into his. Her body was sparkling and wet from the water and lights of the Jacuzzi, and her tits were dripping with steam and sweat. David sat back and let his three lovers do all of the work, while he simply enjoyed himself like a king on his throne.

Eventually, I heard David cry out, ""Oh shit! Oh shit! Almost there!""

Katy's chest began heaving and she fucked him faster, placing her hands on his shoulders while she bucked on top of him like a cowgirl.

""Please, David! Cum inside me! I need your hot cum in me, please! I need it

so

bad!""

The two continued fucking for at least another three minutes until David began grunting in earnest. I saw his expression lock, and he looked passionately into Katy's eyes as they both did what I assume was a mutual orgasm. I saw their gazes remain transfixed while David came off his high enough to realize that I was standing just inside the house, looking out into the patio. David's eyes looked right at me, and he didn't flinch, waiver, or show a hint of regret or hesitation. He stared at me with the eyes of a lion.

It was at that time that I realized I hadn't yet even taken off my coat or dropped my shopping bags. I had been so engaged in what was going on outside that I didn't even remember what I was supposed to be doing inside.

Eventually, Katy rose, her naked ass coming above the water's surface just for a moment as she lifted herself away from David's cock. David's attention went from me to her again, and I watched as she gently pulled both of her arms until she went down on her knees. Then, David's hand touched the top of her head and pushed it under the surface, keeping her held underwater right below my husband's legs. David's eyes glazed over once more, and I knew that Katy was deeply sucking his throat, even while his strong hand kept her submerged.

She was down there for some time, and I started to worry. By reflex, I watched her head attempt to rise at least twice, but David kept her down there. He forced her to keep his plugged in her mouth and under the water. My concern only grew when her attempts to rise were thwarted three extra times, but David finally let her up the fourth time.

Katy burst from the water hastily, choking desperately and clamoring for breath. I thought she would be furious, or at least upset, but she threw herself back into my husband's arms yet again and their tongues slithered together lustfully.

""So . . . INTENSE . . ."" she gasped. ""Makes me . . . cum every time!""

David smiled at her and then turned his attention to one of the other girls. ""Come on, now, she's got me hard again.""

The redhead's grin went from ear to ear as she rose to set herself upon my husband's lap . . . and it all began again.

You may be wondering how all of this made me feel. After all, my husband had just brazenly fucked some teenage slut in our pool and manhandled her without giving a care to me. But, the truth was, I didn't know how to feel about it. On the one-hand, I was used to David's extra-marital capers. It had been a few months after I'd discovered that he'd begun an affair without own

daughter,

but I'd also learned that it wasn't largely his fault. Ronnie, as it turned out, was a vengeful and manipulative bitch who'd been scheming to take my husband away from me for years, and she had finally succeeded . . . sexually, at least.

But David had still loved me. He and I were trapped under Rhonda's rule, but we still had each other. He never stopped making love to me, or holding me in his arms, or making me feel like I was the woman he'd married. At least, at first.

In the past weeks, David had suddenly changed. I had no idea what had caused it, but I was sure Ronnie was behind it at least partly. Ronnie was behind

everything.

I don't know what she did or said to him, but David had become almost a different person overnight. I had always known that David reluctantly enjoyed having sex with Rhonda . . . after all, our daughter grew into a gorgeous, sexy woman, so why wouldn't he . . . but as of late, the ""reluctant"" part had ended. Now, David fucked Rhonda, and any other woman that opened her legs for him, with utter abandon.

Twice in the past week, I had come home to find that David had taken the day off work. I knew this because the moment I opened the door, I could hear the sounds of fucking coming from out bedroom. Rhonda and I had a little . . . agreement, and she usually didn't like to fuck David in our bed—she said the smell of my body

disgusted

her.

But that day, it wasn't Rhonda I found in our bed, but Sera, one of the coeds that Rhonda had arranged to be David's ""servicers"". When I walked into the room, David was mounted between Sera's legs, rutting away like a man possessed, making our bed creak and moan with each driving thrust as he relentless pounded the girl's pussy. Sera's long, shapely chocolate legs were spread wide apart, giving my husband ample access as he drilled into her tight cunt. Well, I'm assuming she was tight, anyway . . . David's cock is impressively thick.

Sera's mouth was wide open, and all that escaped it were cries of joy and ecstasy. It was clear that David was putting everything Rhonda had taught him about fucking to work as she slammed every inch of her pussy and kept her on the heights of ecstasy. If I had to use my womanly empathy to guess how many times Sera came then, I would put it somewhere between six and seven . . . and that was only after I'd walked into the room. Who knew how long the two of them had been at it before I arrived.

As I had so many times in the past, I found myself mesmerized. I'd been privy to threesomes with David before, but he was always much more base and animalistic when he fucked someone without me around. It sounds weird of me to say this, but I had almost begun to

prefer

watching David fuck someone than taking part of it myself, because I felt like David really let himself go when that happened. In the past few weeks, I had learned that watching my husband give pleasure was usually better than receiving it from him myself.

David fucked Sera without either noticing me for another twenty minutes and she came several times afterward until David finally let himself go, and came deep inside her pussy. David never wore condoms anymore, even though he had for the first few threesomes we'd had together. Now, whenever I saw him fuck someone else, it was always bare, and he always,

always

finished in either their ass or pussy.

I wondered whether or not he was

trying

to get these girls pregnant. I couldn't imagine why—we already had five children running around the house, without even counting the

triplets

that David had put into our daughter.

But that was only the beginning of the change, before the true depths of his transformation could be felt. I finally realized how much of a different man my husband was one day while I was out in the garage doing some cleaning. I'd woken up pretty horny that morning, after hearing David and Ronnie fucking half the night, but when I woke up in the morning and looked for him, I entered Ronnie's wing of the house and heard Ronnie giving the soundproof walls a true run for their money. So, I left the two of them at it and decided to work off my energy in a productive way.

I was about an hour into the task when I was carrying a box of garbage to the front of the garage, where the workers know to pick it up. The box was way more than I should have even tried to handle, and I accidentally fumbled it before I got there. With a frustrated groan, I stopped and bent myself over to begin collecting things. I was about halfway finished when I felt something bump into me from behind.

I turned in fright, and found David standing right behind me, with his hands on my hips.

""David! Where did you c—""

""Shut up and keep your voice down,"" he told me. ""Unless, of course, you

want

to attract attention . . . ""

I started to ask what he was talking about, but then I felt his hands tightly grip the hem of my spandex pants, followed by a loud rip.

""David! What do you think you're—""

Before I could say another word, David had his pants pushed down and his cock had entered me from behind. There we were, right in the back of our home while my husband thrust himself deep into me and began to fuck me. I could barely even think straight for several seconds until my mind settled down from the initial orgasm.

""David . . . ugn . . . "" I moaned, still attempting to draw some breath. ""What in the world is this?""

""This, my dear, is the way it will be from now on,"" David began, his hands gripping my hips tighter as he continued to pound into me. ""I'm just giving you a taste.""

My knees almost buckled. David had to hold me steady while he continued to bang me in my hunched-over position.

""From now on, your job is to give me this pussy . . . or anything else that I want . . . whenever I want it . . . with no questions asked. Is that clear?""

""David, I—""

""IS. THAT. CLEAR?""

Our home was in a tightly secluded area, but there were still people who came to the nearby parks and hillsides for recreation or wildlife observation. On top of that, this was the season when all the bird watchers liked to come out to find some rare and endangered type of fowl that lived in our area or something, so I knew that in all likelihood, other eyes weren't far off.

The fear of being caught only enhanced the insane pleasure I felt at the moment, but it also made me more eager to give into my husband's demands.

""Yes! Yes, it's clear!"" I agreed. ""Oh, oh God . . . I'm cumming.""

""Don't you dare,"" David told me. ""Sometimes, the sound of a woman's orgasm makes me cum on reflex, and I'm not ready to blow my load just yet. First, I want to straighten out a few other things, understand?""

""L-Like what?"" I asked, trying my best to keep my body in check.

""First, I want you to know that both Katy and Sera are pregnant.""

My heart skipped a beat. This was something I'd feared and knew, with the way David had been fucking them, was inevitable. Still, it made me worried. We lived in a huge home, but now we were expecting

ten

young legs and feet running through. What was David

thinking!?

But then he continued. ""I've come to like this. I've come to enjoy my new life. I've come to love what Ronnie does for me, and I wanted you to know that she's replaced you as my favorite.""

Another shock went through me, but this time, it wasn't entirely pleasurable. ""David . . . what are you saying?!""

""I'm saying that, for all intents and purposes, I belong to Ronnie now. She's done more for me in the past four years than you did throughout our entire marriage.""

I whimpered, not just from David's words, but because I knew that Ronnie had every inch of the house bugged. So, she would know what David had just told me . . . if she wasn't aware already.

Then I started to worry. What was

this

then . . . what David was doing to me now? Was this a ""goodbye"" fuck? Was this one final thing to remember him by before a divorce? Even after everything that he'd done for the past months, and the years I hadn't known about before that, I still loved David . . . I still

needed

him. I couldn't see my life without him at all. We'd sworn we'd always be together until death.

But if I'd already been replaced, then, he didn't need me anymore.

""So, what I'm telling you is that you need to better earn your keep,"" David spoke up. ""You don't own this house—Ronnie paid for every brick. You don't cook, clean or watch the kids—Katy does that for us now. And you don't give me half as much sex as any of the other girls . . . including Ronnie. So, what exactly can you do for me?""

There was a long pause where I was sure that David was waiting for an answer . . . but I couldn't think of anything. Not like this . . . not with him both fucking me and making me feel like so much garbage at the same time. I was on the edge of both tears and orgasm at the same time.

""Since you don't have an answer, I'll give you what I've been thinking about: I want you to be ready . . . at every waking and dreaming second of every day . . . to do whatever you can to please me and Ronnie. I'm giving you this opportunity because you've been totally loyal to me despite everything that's been happening in the past few years. But, that is the

only

courtesy I will extend. Furthermore, this offer is pending whether or not you answer the next question to my satisfaction.""

I held my breath. Despite myself, I could feel the wetness trickling from between my legs.

""Did you get your tubes tied yet?""

I gulped. ""N-No. I know . . . I know I needed to, but I just haven't—""

""Good,"" David said as he reached forward and lifted my sweater above my tits, fondling them. He squeezed them vigorously, evidently more than pleased with my answer. ""I want more babies from you.

""The only good thing you've done in your life is give me beautiful children and a daughter who's showed me all the love a true daughter can. Other than that, what have you given me? All those years of 'happiness' we had together? Even a month with Ronnie easily trumps that.""

Again, I was dumbfounded. These sounded like

Ronnie's

words, not David's. Had she

forced

him to say these things? Maybe that was it. Maybe David was only saying this because Ronnie had made him.

I wanted to believe that. I truly did.

""Ronnie's shown me the light,"" David told me. ""I only care about three things now: making my beautiful, slutty daughter happy . . . finding out how many other sluts I can fuck at any given time . . . and how many babies I can make with them. And if you aren't adding to any of those three, then I have no use for you. Understand?""

I swallowed hard. ""Y-Yes, David.""

""Hmph,"" he responded. ""Admittedly, I'm used to younger wombs now, so I don't even know if one this used up can give me what I want. But, it's mine, anyway. Understand?""

God, why was this making me shiver all over? Why was this making me so

wet?!

""Yes, David.""

""Furthermore, the conditions of my service to Ronnie are now the conditions of your service to

me.

You will not refuse me, ever. If I tell you to bend over and spread your legs, you will do it, even if I call and tell you to do it at the grocery store. You will not speak of this deal to anyone, not even Ronnie, and if you are doing anything else when I desire your pussy, you will drop whatever it is immediately and serve my needs.

""Is this understood?""

""Yes, David.""

""This offer is

more

than fair to me,"" he said. ""None of the other girls are being treated so leniently.""

I don't know why I said these next words. They . . . just slipped out of me. ""T-Thank you, David.""

David gave my ass a firm slap and then I felt him begin driving harder into me. ""You may cum now.""

I let go with everything I had. I'd been building up ever since he'd first forced me to hold back, and it was like setting off an atomic bomb. I came so hard that I blacked out, and only came to when I felt David squirming his cock into me, trying to coax the last bits of cum.

When he was done, he just turned and left me, forcing me to scramble back to the house to clean up and find some clothing. While I was showering I took time to absorb everything. I sank into the water and sobbed, still positively shaken.

I knew then that I'd lost the man I'd married. The David that had been with me from then on had gone, and I didn't know if he would ever be back. It didn't seem likely, with the way Ronnie kept him so sated and wrapped around her finger. If I had to be honest with myself, I had lost my husband months ago . . . actually, maybe even before then, when he and Ronnie first started fucking behind my back. I think this was just the pure, uncensored reality finally slapping me in the face.

David belonged fully to Ronnie now. Even his tone, his wording sounded like hers. By all rights, my marriage was over.

But, as I sat there, the obvious thought never crossed my mind. Not once did I think about leaving, or divorcing David. Not once did I think about walking away from it. Curiously, I was numb to by the time the water stopped running. Once the initial shock had died down, I was left with nothing but purpose . . . and fulfillment.

This ""new"" David excited me as much as he terrified me.

THREE DAYS LATER

-RHONDA-

I had to admit that I was amazed at how eager to follow my orders The Bitch had become. Over the past few months, I'd noticed some sort of change in her. It happened right after the day I saw Daddy going out to meet her near the garage. Unfortunately, I never found out what happened between the two of them that day, because by sheer bad luck, my audio surveillance file was corrupted. I ordered Daddy to tell me some of the details the next time we fucked, but it would have been nicer to hear it straight from the recording.

-KATY-

This is a new journal that I've taken to recording in order to organize my thoughts better. I apologize if I make any grammatical mistakes or show a less than acceptable understanding of the English language, as my first language is Arabic.

So, please allow me to introduce myself. My very formal name is Princess Kathirah bint Saleh Abd al-Hasan . . . but most Americans know me by the simpler name of ""Katy"" Hasan. I picked up that nickname during my first year or so living in the United States, when I was just a little girl. I gave my teacher attitude because she was doing a math problem wrong, and I refused to agree with her even when she hit me on my knuckles and made me write ""I will not act like a know-it-all"" three thousand times. People said that I was being ""catty"", and eventually, everyone just shortened my first name to call me that all the time.

I was born the final child of thirty-seven to Prince Saleh Abdul Hasan, and my father decided to use me as sort of an ""experiment"". I don't mean that in a bad way. It was just that, after raising eighteen of my brothers and eighteen of my sisters, my father decided that his final child would be the one he raised to be special. I was sent to the United States when I was only a baby, to be raised and educated both in the ways of the West and the East. My father wished for me to be something unique—exactly what he expected me to grow into, I'm not sure, and he died before he could reveal the grand plan to me.

As a result, I'm a product of two worlds. I speak both Arabic and English fluently, although I feel much more comfortable in the former. I'm well-versed in both American and Saudi history, culture and literature, and I have an education which is both Islamic and secular. I'm more than capable of blending in completely in either worlds, being able to drop my Arabic accent for an American one and vice-versa, but I much prefer to simply be myself. It's far less stressing that way.

I was followed everywhere by a team of chaperones and tutors, but when I grew older, I became bold enough to try venturing on my own from time to time. I became a party girl, drinking, clubbing, doing all of the things good Muslim girls shouldn't. Well, everything except one. I never let anyone take my virginity, although many,

many

men tried. Don't get me wrong—it wasn't because I was a prude or anything . . . while it's true that Islam forbids sex outside of marriage, the rules are different when you're rich, and especially when visiting outside of Saud. I've actually broken several of your American laws several times since I was a child, but it was all covered up because my father was one of the richest men in the world.

As the saying goes in my family, ""The rules need not have meaning to us.""

I was a very naughty girl. I liked attention, so I intentionally wore clothes that barely covered my breasts, my rear, or my legs. I have a birthmark just below my left butt-cheek, and the rule I always followed was that if my outfit covered the mark, I wouldn't wear it. I wanted men's tongues dragging across the floor when they saw me, and for the most part, I got what I wanted. However, it was frustrating that most of the men that approached me were all Muslim, because even when I was younger, I had developed a fetish for white men.

I wanted my first lover to be special. I wanted him to be kinky, exotic, and something I would remember forever, even when I would eventually return home and probably be married to some boring Saudi guy. I wanted to release all of my inhibitions and fulfill my every fantasy while in the States. Oh yes, some of us Muslim girls are that way—that's something the news will never tell you.

One day, I was approached by a man who said that he was searching for ""talented"" girls. I did not know what exactly he meant, but I decided to try this. Eventually, I was sent for ""testing"" with other girls. There were over forty of us, and many of them were foreigners like myself. We were all instructed to strip ourselves naked in front of total strangers and try on various lewd and perverse clothes. The men had cameras and videotape with them, and they filmed us all. Some of us were instructed to touch each other and look into the camera a certain way. Some of us were even made to kiss.

That was my first experience touching my lips to another woman's . . . and I did not find it to my disliking.

The men thanked us for our time and released us, saying that they would be in touch. They called each of us back for more pictures and more making out, but one by one, some of the girls never came back. Whatever happened to them, I was the last girl to be approached . . . and I believe it had something to do with the fact that I was still a virgin at the time. I have heard that this would have made me ""priceless"" in certain circles.

When I was eventually approached for ""work"", I was called in to take several more pictures, and a video where I did nothing but describe myself and talk about what sort of things I liked and disliked. They asked me who my favorite actor was (Matt Damon), what sort of guys I liked (brown hair, blue eyes, light skin), and what my turn-ons were (letting go, being a complete, wanton slut, being fucked like a cow). The men once again thanked me and then paid me for my time—I had never held so much American money in my hands at one time! They told me that if I wanted more where it came from, that I only needed to continue coming when they called.

Eventually, I was contacted by someone through email . . . this mysterious person would only refer to themself as the ""Buyer"", who said that they were acting on behalf of an equally mysterious ""Client"". I was never allowed to know the name of this Buyer, and the only business ever conducted was electronically. However, I was told that I would get to meet the Client in person should I meet certain criteria.

I wasn't naïve. I knew that I was being traded as a good . . . but this was such an opportunity for me. The thought of being marketed off sort of appealed to a darker side within me and gave me a rush that was unbelievable. The Buyer told me that all I needed to do was meet the Client and his wife, and do anything and everything they told me to. It would be over within hours, and I would walk away with more money than I could count. Of course, I didn't really need the money . . . but the thought of taking it for letting a stranger have my pussy made me wet.

When I was eventually called and told that I was ""hired"", I only asked the ""Buyer"" for one request: to see a picture of the man that would take my virginity. I was sent a picture by mail with no return address. He was most handsome man I'd ever seen in my life. Matt Damon could go screw himself.

His name was David. He was brown-haired with specs of gray, he had a very rugged and sexy five o'clock shadow, and his eyes were crystal blue. His nose looked strong and narrow, his lips were thin but soft, and his chin was thick. His skin was peach, with the lightest of tans. He was everything I had ever wanted and more.

Of course, I was nervous . . . and that only increased my excitement. I wanted to live dangerously—I wasn't within the States because I wanted to be coddled and protected. I wanted to live a life to be remembered, and to make my own choices, for good or for bad.

I went to David's home and steeled myself for what was to come. I was directed to a lovely home deep within a lush, forested hillside, somewhat separated from the nearest city and miles away from another home. I went to the front door and rang the bell.

When the door opened, I was greeted by a lovely woman who appeared to be somewhat in her late thirties, although I would soon find out that she was actually in her early forties and simply looked very good for her age. She was dark-haired and fair of skin like David was, and she possessed friendly brown eyes. I knew immediately that she must have been David's wife, and imagined that the two of them must have made some gorgeous children together. She invited me inside and made me feel right at home. She asked my name and even made me a cup of tea, telling me to wait in the living room until she could locate her husband so that he could meet me himself.

I had never been more scared in my life, nor so excited. I did not know what these two wished to do with me, only that it would be something sexual and that I was being paid to fulfill their every desire. As I stated already, I was still a virgin at this time, and I was still ""intact"" as a proper Muslim woman should be. But, if I went through with this, I would be finally crossing a line that I would never be able to turn away from.

Finally, the woman returned from the top of the stairs and said that David would be soon to join us. I stood and waited for this man to appear . . . to see what kind of creature I was willing to be sold to. My heart was pounding so fiercely in my chest, and my palms had run cold. Half of my mind told me to run out of the door, return to my family and my chaperones and tell them that I was foolish. But, the other half would not allow it.

So, I waited. And then he appeared.

For me, it was pure love at first sight.

******

-RHONDA-

For the first time in a while, I couldn't fully enjoy Daddy's cock while it slowly pumped into my tight, hungry pussy. My mind was in two places at once, mulling over what I'd heard being said between The Bitch and that detective that had shown up earlier that day. The conversation was very odd, with nothing that really seemed to be worrisome, but that was actually what worried me the most. Those questions were almost pointless for a hired investigator to ask, which led me to believe that he was attempting to gauge The Bitch's reactions. Unfortunately, neither the audio nor the camera angle gave me a good indication of how she'd reacted or what her facial expressions were. But knowing her dumb ass, she was probably as subtle as a bonfire.

That meant that this detective was suspicious. And that he would be back.

I didn't dare tell Daddy what had happened. He had more important things to do, like making sure that our sweaty, wet bodies rubbed together while he mounted me from behind. Daddy didn't need to concern himself with the day-to-day. He didn't need to even

think

at all. I would do all of those things for him. All I needed him to do was use my pussy for his own delight, and make sure that he kept me filled with his milky seed.

Daddy delivered on all levels. He spent a solid half-hour fucking me hard from behind, sawing in and out of my moist cunt. He grunted like an animal every time he thrust all the way into me, and the impact was so hard that my arms nearly gave out after a few minutes. We were only half into it and my body was completely covered with sweat, and I could feel it dripping from him as well. The sheets below me were soaked with the efforts of our lovemaking.

Eventually, Daddy slowed down and began making slow love to me. Keeping his cock buried to the hilt while he pulled me against him and kissed me from behind. I rolled my tongue and my father's tongue together until we'd swapped saliva, and then I looked him deep in the eyes and soaked in the fire in his eyes as he continued to slowly grind my pussy and squeeze my tits. His hands wandered, everywhere, the slickness of my sweat, making it effortless for him to touch me anywhere he pleased—and I encouraged him to touch me

everywhere

. I

loved

feeling his strong hands over every part of me.

Then, abruptly, Daddy threw me face down on the bed again and began to fuck me even more savagely than before. It was just a constant tremor of action, my body bouncing back and forth on Daddy's cock with complete abandon while he fucked me with an inhuman pace. There was no gentleness or rhythm of any kind. Daddy just took me like a force of nature, and I lay on my stomach and let him.

He eventually grasped my hips hard and shot his load deep inside me, where our next child had already begun to grow. I was now a full month pregnant with Daddy's sixth child . . . well by me, anyway, but I don't count any of those other pieces of garbage he made with those other sluts . . . and he already had me wishing he could somehow get me pregnant again. I'd carry a thousand of Daddy's babies in me if it were possible. I'll give him all the children he could ever want.

That's why this detective situation was pissing me off. Where the fuck did he come from? What did he want? I finally had

everything

I always wanted. Daddy was completely happy, The Bitch was a broken cuckquean, and I shared my bed with the only man I'd ever loved. Eleven years of planning and my genius had finally made it happen.

So, why couldn't the rest of the world just fuck off and

die!?

-KATY-

""Oh God, David . . . I . . . I love what you do to me. I love the way you feel inside me.""

""Oh yeah?"" he asked, as I continued to feel his balls slap against me from behind with each thrust. ""Tell me how much you love it.""

""I l-l-love it more than anything in the world, David! I've never felt s-s-so good!""

""So do you want my cock in you as often as possible?""

""Y-Yes, David! I want it in me always!""

""That makes you my slut, you know that? That makes you my slutty little slave to fuck whenever I have the need.""

""Yes, David! I'm your slut! Your slave! Your whore! Your sharmootaa! Just don't ever stop fucking me! Please, don't ever stop!""

""What will you do for my cock, slut?""

""I will do anything you ever ask me to, David! I will follow your every command!""

""Then say right now that you'll be my slave from here on, and that you want no other cock but mine.""

""I . . . I will be your slave from here on, David . . . now and forever! I will never let another cock near me but yours!""

""Tell me that you want to have my baby.""

""Yes! Yah, Allah! I will have your baby, David! I will have as many of your babies as you want! I will be your woman, for you to use and impregnate as you see fit, now and forever!""

Sitting alone in my home, I listened to that recording over and over. I wasn't allowed to bring a video recorder to my ""sessions"" with David, but I was able to smuggle audio one. I kept it in my purse the whole time, and I often listened to it when I returned to my home and thought of David.

Faleen, my chaperone and friend, felt concerned for me, saying that I was becoming too ""attached"" to the American man. She said that I needed to remember that this was all in fun, and that I needed to remain respectfully aware of my role as a Saudi princess.

But I didn't listen to a word of it.

I was in heat, I was in lust, and I was in love. I thought about David every day and every night. My body burned white hot when he wasn't inside me, and no matter how much money I received from the ""Buyer"", it was never enough. The money only made things worse. It told me that David was only mine so long as the Buyer was willing to pay. If he . . . or she . . . ever decided to end things, I would never have my David again.

When David finally made me pregnant, it was the happiest day of my life, despite the furled brows of everyone in my court. I'd wanted so badly to give him a baby, and Allah, who is all-powerful and all-kind, finally blessed me with one. The all-knowing one understood what a great man, David was.

I wanted to add to the four children he already had. He was always such a wonderful father whenever I saw him with his own children as well as the two grandchildren his daughter had produced from her various boyfriends. David

loved

children, and I knew he wanted nothing less than to see my body swelling with his child. At last, I was able to deliver just that.

David carried me over the threshold like a blushing bride when I broke the news to him, and we spent the entire day making love. No other women . . . not even his wife . . . just he and I. I had never felt so loved or fulfilled. I knew I'd made the right choice to make

this

man the father of my children, and I swore that I would keep my body in good health to bear him many more for the far, far future. Even if it one day cost me my family and fortune.

My belly grew at a steady rate, and David watched me with a keen eye. He enjoyed touching my swollen belly, and seeing his fruit stretch me. I intentionally wore the tightest clothes I could find for him, even if they were a size or two too small, just so that he could see how obscene I looked. On more than one occasion, David was on hand to witness my breasts tear through a bra that didn't fit me or my belly pop a button on a shirt too small. It drove him

crazy

with lust to me, and he could never keep his hands . . . or cock . . . off of me.

In the meantime, however, I sometimes began to wonder of his wife. I wanted to speak to her on occasion, but we could rarely exchange words. I think she saw me as just another of her husband's distractions—after all, the black girl Sera had been impregnated by David just as well—but I wanted to be friends with her, because I wasn't planning on going anywhere. I had no desire to steal another woman's husband, but Islam doesn't insist that a man can only belong to one woman. A strong, willful man can love many women, and I had no doubt that David held love for us both. I also suspected that David had another lover as well . . . . There was never any evidence of such a thing, but it was just a feeling I acquired after nearly a full year of being a part of his household.

Soon, it became time for me to give birth, and I started to think long and hard about my future with David and that of our children. The nearer I came to my delivery, the more the situation weighed at my conscience. Here I was, pledged to belong to David until the end of time, and I was still accepting money for servicing him like a common whore. Receiving pay for wifely or motherly duties would be one thing, but I was being paid by a third party for doing nothing but opening my legs for him. I didn't want that for David anymore. He deserved to have me, and to know that the money meant nothing to me compared to his happiness.

But, that was when tragedy struck. When I tried to change the deal with the ""Buyer"", he or she became furious and immediately forbade me from ever seeing David again! I pleaded with them to change their mind, but they stopped returning my mail, and eventually the server told me that the email address no longer even existed! A few days later, mysterious men . . .

men . . . arrived at my door. They came in and made themselves at home in my home. Some of them even began to eat my food! My tutors and chaperones did their best to protect me, and make me feel safe, but they weren't trained bodyuards.",,2025-08-15T19:14:03.350365,3702,7.0

It's Emma.

Today was very much an experience. I was so naughty; I've never entertained those things before, and, I really don't want to do them again because I'm so scared of the come back.

Here goes...

I was getting myself ready for work this afternoon, and Luke just kept stalling me. I was telling him I can't mess around because I can't afford to lose my job, but he insisted. He kept me from leaving all the way until Louisa arrived. I was already way past the time I would normally leave for work, with less than ten minutes before I should arrive. They had me phone-in sick to work, even though I was fine, ""Yeah, I can't make it today,"" sniffing to try and sell it, which Luke and Louisa found funny.

""You're leaving us short on short-notice. Next time, you should give us at least two hours before your shift.""

""Got it. I'm sorry,"" I said to my manager before putting the phone down. I might've got away with that one, but it didn't feel like it.

Louisa told me, ""Wow! That was fun to watch. Good girl!,"" laughing at my expense as she does.

Luke said to me, ""Now that you're free, you can come out with us.""

Naively, I asked, ""What, like a date?""

Louisa's laugh became more forced, and Luke made himself clear, ""No, I mean you come outside with us. We have some fun things we would like to do with you.""

I got the feeling that they wouldn't be doing that much, and I would be subject to whatever they had planned, but, who was I to say no at this point...

The three of us went out to the local park: lots of open grass, bordering trees and bushes, benches, fenced off around it's perimeter; it's a popular place to go through throughout the day. We were stood by the fence, looking into the park, with thick foliage at our backs.

Louisa dared me, ""We want you to play here. That's what you do at the park: play!""

Acting clueless, I asked, ""Play what?""

Louisa leant to my ear to whisper, ""You play with your pussy.""

Shocked, I expressly said, ""No! No. I'm not doing that here. Look at how many people there are!""

Louisa was quick to say, ""Oh, they don't care. They're doing their own things, and so should you.""

I felt insane for even entertaining this, but hoped to speak reason, ""And, if I don't do it?""

Louisa got out her phone, aimed with the camera in my direction, and suggested, ""I'm sure the lovely people at your work would like to see why you let them down at the last minute.""

I couldn't believe it, but then I also could believe it. She would expose me to everyone without any conscience. ""Okay, okay,"" as I unzipped the fly of my work trousers, and I slid my hand in. I felt the fabric of my pants, and my incontinence pad through them, and I worked my hand against my skin under the pants, neatly nestled nicely.

I nervously watched the people pass the path in-front of us, all seemingly oblivious, absorbed in phones, tablets, newspapers, bopping away to the sounds from their headphones. I felt emboldened, but frightfully cautious.

It wasn't long before a dogwalker came by, and their dog fetched a ball that landed near us. My hand stopped still, hoping to not attract attention, and it's owner knelt down to pet his dog, glancing a disgusted look at me, telling me, ""Have some shame! Kids play here,"" quickly ushering his dog along with him as they left.

I was so embarrassed, but I felt Luke and Louisa looking at me without even looking at them, so I continued with myself.

Louisa proposed, ""I want to see more!""

I trembled with absolute terror hearing this.

Louisa said to me, ""Pull your bottoms down, and have a seat. Wouldn't want you collapsing when things get good,"" giggling softly, looking around like a naughty schoolgirl.

I did as she asked, sitting with my back against the fence, and my trousers and pants around my ankles. I sat with my knees pressed together, but spread my legs as wide as I could in the constraints after seeing the dirty look from Louisa.

Luke looked around as a watch-out, and he quickly turned to usher us up, urgently saying, ""Police are coming."" Sure, enough there were a couple of officers patrolling the park, and heading our way, so I scrambled to my feet, fixing my clothes, and Louisa and Luke ran with me away from the park.

The police had chased after us, calling to us around the corner from the park, ""Hey! Is this yours?,"" holding my incontinence pad in hand.

My heart was thick in my throat, and I struggled to get a word out, but Louisa explained, ""Oh, thanks. She was caught short, Old Pissy Pants, here. Sorry, Officers.""

I took the pad back, and the officer said, ""I don't see you've done anything wrong, although you were acting suspicious, so consider this a warning. Behave.""

After the officers went their way, I told Luke and Louisa, ""I could've been done for indecent exposure back there! I don't think we should be doing that again.""

Louisa just said, ""Relax. I got you out of it. After all, how would I get you to do more crazy things if you're behind bars?

""Anyway, I'm soaked. That was so much fun! Let's go behind the bins down there, and fuck,"" leading Luke with her down the alley.

I followed, and I watched, hungry for the touch of his cock, but knowing I should keep my hands to myself, so I did. The novelty of this hasn't worn off for me.

*****

The blackness behind the blindfold was absolute. Victoria Reynolds knelt in her own private universe of darkness. She could hear Marta circling her slowly, sizing her up. She imagined how odd she must look to her old friend. She was naked, collared and leashed in her own foyer. A large silicone butt plug protruded from her anus. She felt the familiar tug of the heavy steel rings adorning her labia and nipples. The heavy brass lock swayed lazily between her legs.

The slave felt eyes upon her and remained perfectly still. In a moment, she sensed movement in front of her, then felt a slight tug as the bell hanging from her left nipple ring was flicked lightly. It chimed musically before falling still. A moment later, a firm hand cupped her bare vulva appraisingly, jingling her labial rings and setting the lock in motion. It swayed like a pendulum back and forth between her legs in a neat arc.

""Such a dirty girl,"" said Marta huskily. ""That's a lot of hardware you're toting around there, Vicky.""

Silence filled the room once again as Marta continued to circle the kneeling slave middle-aged slave slowly. Victoria heard light footfalls to her left, then was shocked to hear the heavy tread of boots off to her right. She felt a momentary flare of panic. Someone else was here!

""Oh, I see you've heard we have a guest,"" said Marta silkily. ""I hope you don't mind, but I brought my date from last night over to share in the fun,"" said Marta casually, reaching down and removing the envelope from the slave's mouth.

Victoria licked her lips.

""No, of course I don't mind, Miss Marta,"" said Victoria eagerly. Remembering the contents of the letter, she plastered a smile on her face for good measure. The blindfold felt heavy across her eyelids.

""I like that...Miss Marta,"" murmured the older woman, holding up the envelope. ""Has a nice ring to it, don't you think, hole?""

""Yes, mistress,"" replied a soft voice off to the left.

Victoria heard Marta snap her fingers once, then came the rustling sound of clothing being removed quickly.

Marta walked up to Victoria, then reached down and cupped her chin with her left hand.

""I brought along my latest slave. She's a straight girl from the university I'm turning. Young people nowadays are so adventurous. I named her hole because those are her best features, three warm, wet holes for me to use. Isn't that right, hole?""

""Yes, mistress,"" came the same quiet voice.

Marta leaned down until her face was only inches from Victoria's.

""She's currently serving as my ass-slave,"" she whispered. ""Do you know what an ass-slave is, Vicky?""

""No, Miss Marta,"" replied the middle-aged slave, trembling slightly now.

Although she had known Marta was into the lifestyle, Victoria was taken aback by the primal, authoritative presence of her old friend and the ease with which she had assumed total control. It had been less than a minute since she walked into the room, but already it was clear that Rebecca was a mere novice compared to this much more seasoned mistress. Unconsciously, the slave leaned back slightly.

""An ass-slave is a new slave who's tongue is not yet clever enough for my pussy, so all she gets is ass,"" whispered Marta harshly into Victoria's left ear. ""Tell me, Vicky. Is your tongue good enough for my pussy?""

""Yes...I mean I hope so, Miss Marta,"" croaked the kneeling slave.

""We shall see,"" said Marta cooly, releasing the slave's chin and patting her head lightly.

Victoria heard Marta take three heavy steps, then heard the cushion squeak as she took a seat in the overstuffed arm chair against the wall. There came the sound of paper tearing as the dominatrix opened the envelope.

""It says I'm supposed to read it out loud,"" said Marta flatly.

The kneeling slave said nothing. She braced herself for what was to come.

""Dear Marta,"" began the older woman in a calm, assured voice.

""My name is Rebecca Morris and your neighbor, Dr. Victoria Reynolds, is my pet cunt.

We have met several times, but you may not remember me. I am a second year surgery resident at University Medical Center. Approximately six months ago, I was approached by Victoria with an unusual proposal.

You may be shocked to learn that your old friend is what is colloquially referred to as a cuckquean. If you are not familiar with the term, a cuckquean is a wife who gets off on the idea of her husband having sex with another woman. Not only that, she actually goes out and gets the women and brings them home for her husband. Victoria has been living this lifestyle for about two years.

Dr. Reynolds asked me to participate in their arrangement and I assented, so for the past several months I have been having sex with her husband, Thomas on a regular basis. On these occasions, Victoria serves us both as our sex slave. She licks me to get me wet, then sucks her husband's cock until he is hard enough to fuck me. Sometimes, I let Victoria watch, but usually I have her kneel in the corner, facing the wall as we make love. When we are done, Victoria always eats her husband's semen out of my vagina, then licks his penis clean.""

Marta paused in her reading and looked down at the blindfolded slave.

""Is this true, Vicky? Of course I remember Rebecca. She's that cute young doctor you're always bringing around. Are you really her slave? She's sleeping with your husband?"" she asked in open astonishment.

""Yes, Miss Marta,"" said the slave glumly, feeling a flush creep down from her ears to the nape of her neck.

Marta stared hard at her neighbor for several beats, then looked back down at the letter and continued to read.

""Early on, Dr. Reynolds discovered she enjoyed being submissive to the women she procured for her husband. Over the years, she has blossomed into a quite capable slave. She has also developed a intense fetish for humiliation and degradation. Sometimes I wonder if she has any limits at all. No matter how badly I treat her, she always comes back for more. She is ever the obedient slave.

To illustrate her servility, I direct your attention to her tattoo and body jewelry. I had her vagina marked and pierced about four months ago, the same time I had her nipples skewered. I have been applying progressively heavier rings and weights to her labia and nipples in order to stretch them and thereby make Victoria less sexually attractive to her husband. Victoria has done this of her own free will and even does stretching exercises by herself every day.""

Marta paused again and looked over at the kneeling slave.

""Crawl over here, Vicky and stand up. I want to have a closer look, please,"" said Marta briskly.

The slave fell forward onto her hands, then crawled quickly toward the sound of Marta's voice. When she was close, she reached out blindly with both hands until she found Marta's heavy boots, then stood on shaky legs. She spread her legs as wide as possible and thrust out her pelvis, lacing her hands behind her head as she always did for inspection.

Marta bent down and wordlessly examined the slave's crotch for a long minute, then reached out and gently tugged on the heavy lock, stretching the delicate inner labia taught. They extended a good six inches below the vertex of the slave's thighs. Victoria whimpered slightly, but held her position.

""Interesting,"" said Marta clinically. ""What an imaginative, young mistress you have, Victoria,"" she added in obvious admiration.

""Thank you, Miss Marta,"" grunted the slave.

Marta released her tension on the lock, then tapped it gently, setting it swinging back and forth like a metronome.

""Back on your knees, please, Victoria,"" she said curtly.

The slave sunk back down on to her knees and remained still.

Marta picked up the letter again and continued reading.

""One of the central tenets of cuckqueanery, is that the female feels that her own vagina is incapable of providing enough pleasure for her husband. When I took over as her mistress, I capitalized on this weakness and took it one step farther. As you can see, Victoria's vagina, in addition to being floppy and stretched out, is also locked shut. Her vagina now belongs to me. It has not been fucked for well over four months and will likely never be penetrated again. If her husband is feeling randy and I'm not around, he fucks her ass or her mouth, but never her pussy. The lock is always in place when I am visiting. She is allowed to remove it only after I leave.

I have tried my best to train Victoria to be a good sex slave. She is adept at servicing both men and women. She can deep-throat any cock without gagging and has learned recently to orgasm from receptive anal intercourse. I am bisexual and have spent several wonderful hours with Victoria's talented tongue buried in my pussy or ass. She has become quite an accomplished cunt-licker and I have shared her widely with my friends.

Which brings us to the reason you are here, Marta.

I have been watching you. You could even say I've been spying on you. Last time you had us over for dinner, I'm afraid I did a little snooping. I didn't mean to. It just happened. I was on my way to the bathroom when I thought I heard someone sobbing in your basement. The cellar door was ajar, so I crept quietly down the stairs. I saw your dungeon, Marta!

Quite an impressive collection of whips and restraints you have there. Tell me, Marta, do you keep a person locked up in that little puppy crate down there in the corner? I certainly hope so. I was sure I heard someone breathing down there, but nobody responded when I called out.

Anyway, it is clear you are quite an accomplished dominatrix and today I offer up my slave for you to use. All I ask in return is for you to mentor me. I would like to learn to be a better, harsher mistress to Victoria. I feel she simply needs more discipline than I can currently provide. Who better to teach me than you?

I am particularly interested in learning about the application of corporal punishment, which, I must admit, I have been remiss in administering to Victoria on a regular basis. Judging from my brief survey of the implements hanging on your dungeon wall, it is obvious that you are much better equipped to introduce Victoria to this, mostly unexplored, dimension of her submissiveness than myself.

From now on, you may use Victoria as you wish at any time, providing I am not using her myself. Feel free to share her with your friends, both male and female. My only caveats are that her identity must be protected (she has a slave hood for this purpose), her vagina must never be penetrated and the gentlemen must use condoms when fucking her ass.

So please, use Victoria today. She can eat pussy and ass like a real champ. If she performs well, you can reward her by letting her jingle her rings (she can tell you what that means). If she displeases you in any way, please do not hesitate to punish her.

But either way, I want her whipped.

Please be a dear and send her back to me with dozens of pretty love marks on her udders, pussy and ass. Try not to be concerned if she cries. She does that a lot.

Above all, please don't be gentle.

Best Regards and always keep your whip hand strong,

Rebecca Morris, MD.

p.s. Enclosed, please find the key to her lock. I would appreciate it if you would unlock her vagina when you are finished using her.""

Marta picked up the discarded envelope and tilted it over the nearby end table. A small brass key slid out and tinkled on to the lacquered surface. She folded the letter neatly and tucked it back into the envelope, placing it also on the table. At last, Marta leaned forward and addressed the kneeling slave.

""Is this really what you want, Vicky?"" she asked not unkindly. ""To be used like a whore? To be hurt by me?""

""Yes, Miss Marta,"" replied the slave softly. ""I'm sorry Marta. I just can't help it,"" she choked.

Marta stroked the slave's hair gently.

""There, there, Victoria. No reason to apologize, dear. I understand completely. I know what you are. No need to fight it. Don't worry, darling. Marta has what you need.""

Marta stroked the kneeling slave for a few minutes, soothing her and settling her down, then stood and clapped her hands together.

""Okay, then,"" said Marta curtly, taking ahold of Victoria's leash and jerking it sharply. ""Let's try out that tongue of yours. You can start with hole. If I see you have a modicum of skill, I'll let you taste my pussy. If not, it's going to be ass all day for you.""

""Yes, Miss Marta,"" whispered Victoria.

""But I warn you, Vicky, if your tongue fails me, there will be consequences. Understood?""

""Yes, Miss Marta,"" answered the slave softly.

Marta snapped her fingers.

""Get your ass in the chair, hole,"" she barked.

Victoria heard the sound of movement, then felt her leash being pulled taught.

""Spread those legs, slut,"" ordered Marta curtly.

Victoria was pulled forward on her hands and knees, then felt a hand on the back of her head. Marta leaned down and whispered in her ear.

""I haven't let her bathe since yesterday, so she may be a little pungent down there,"" she said, pushing Victoria's face into the younger slave's pussy. ""Impress me if you want to taste me today,"" she hissed sharply.

Victoria went to work. The pussy before her was cleanly shaven, but did indeed have a more intense musk than she was accustomed to. Marta looked on appraisingly and continued to hold Victoria's leash as the older slave devoured the young pussy before her.

Within only a minute, Victoria felt the the texture of the younger slave's secretions begin to thin as the flow of her juices increased. Soon, all the lingering muskiness was replaced by the distinctive smell of her acute arousal. Victoria was well acquainted with the flavor and redoubled her efforts to finish the girl off.

In less than three minutes, it was over.

Victoria felt the younger slave begin to buck against her face, then heard her begin to grunt quietly in rhythm with the thrusts of her tongue.

""Please may I cum, Mistress?"" panted the young slave.

As Victoria opened her mouth wide to receive the slave's offering, she thought there was something familiar about the inflection of the girl's voice.

""Yes, hole. Cum for me now,"" replied Marta brusquely.

""Aaahhhgggggrrrrr! Oh, God, I'm cumming!"" screamed the young slave as she bounced herself against the older woman's face.

At that moment, Marta reached down and removed Victoria's blindfold.

Victoria's startled eyes widened in shock as she gazed upon the face of her babysitter, just as the young college girl exploded into her mouth.

Victoria's worked her jaws up and down, gulping down the younger slave's essence in deep draughts. It took a full minute for her orgasm to subside. When it was over, the girl sighed heavily, then slumped back in the chair, her head lolling.

Victoria leaned back on her haunches and waited.

""You know Lucinda, from down the street don't you Victoria?"" asked Marta mischievously.

""Yes, Miss Marta,"" replied the older slave, looking down at the floor.

""Say hello, hole,"" said Marta.

The younger slave straightened in the chair, then looked down at the older woman.

""Hello, Dr. Reynolds,"" she said sheepishly.

""Hello, Lucinda. Nice to see you again dear,"" replied Victoria. ""How's school?"" she asked absurdly, absently wiping some of the girl's pussy juice from her chin with the back of her left hand.

""You used to babysit for Dr. Reynolds and her husband, didn't you, hole?"" asked Marta matter-of-factly. ""Before you went to college, right?""

""Yes, mistress,"" said Lucinda quietly.

""Lucinda's parents are in Nantucket for the summer,"" explained Marta conversationally. ""She was bored one day came over for tea a few weeks ago. One thing led to another and, well, you know how it is. Turns out she read Fifty Shades of Grey like everyone else and wanted to see what it was really like to be a slave. The young kids do love to experiment, God bless them.""

Victoria looked up and regarded the younger slave more closely. Like her, Lucinda wore a thick black leather collar and nothing else. Victoria noticed that the younger slave's eyes were red-rimmed from crying. Her pert breasts were cross-crossed with angry red welts. More thick red stripes decorated her belly and bare vulva. Victoria leaned in and examined the pussy she had just serviced and swallowed hard.

The entire vulva was pink and splotchy and striped with dozens of crimson welts. The tender flesh around her outer labia was swollen, purple and bruised. It was obvious that the slave's entire pussy had been expertly and methodically worked over.

""I'm afraid hole was a bit naughty herself this morning, weren't you dear?"" asked Marta.

""Yes, mistress,"" whispered Lucinda, wincing slightly.

""She needed a little correction, didn't you sweetie,"" asked Marta soothingly.

""Yes, mistress,"" answered Lucinda.

""Tell Dr, Reynolds why your were punished, hole.""

Lucinda looked down at the older slave, fresh tears leaking from her eyes.

""I...couldn't make Mistress cum with my mouth,"" said the slave bleakly. ""Not fast enough, anyway,"" she added disconsolately.

""That's right, hole, but you were so close, dear,"" said Marta pleasantly. ""Missed it by only ten seconds this time.""

The younger slave said nothing. She began to sob quietly. Marta looked over at Victoria.

""Each week, I give hole a chance to graduate from ass-slave to pussy-slave,"" she explained reasonably. ""All she has to do is make me cum in less than five minutes using only her tongue. I'm afraid she's just not there yet, so it's still ass-only for her, at least until we try again next Saturday.""

Marta reached down and patted the younger slave on the head affectionately.

""I tell her not to be so hard on herself,"" continued Marta. ""After all, the poor girl never even tasted pussy before I agreed to train her.""

She paused again and smiled sadly down at the novice slave.

""I don't like to punish her when she fails, but I have to. It's part of the training,"" said the older mistress reasonably.

Marta reached down and pulled the younger slave up off the chair by her collar, then forced her roughly down on to her knees. She caressed the slaves left cheek tenderly with her right hand for several seconds, then reached back and slapped her across the face, hard.

""Crawl over and kneel in the corner,"" she ordered. She kicked the slave in the rump with her big black boot as she crawled by.

Marta looked down at Victoria.

""Now it's your turn,"" she said stonily.

Victoria remained kneeling in front of the chair as she watched Marta undress. The mistress sat and unlaced her black work boots, then pulled them off. Next came the socks, followed by the black jeans and t-shirt. She wore no bra. Finally she rolled down her sensible white cotton panties and balled them up in her hand.

Nude and completely at ease, Marta walked over to where Lucinda was kneeling and pulled her panties over the slave's head, making sure the crotch was centered on the girl's nose and mouth.

""Maybe if you smell the scent long enough to you'll learn how to lick it properly, you dumb cunt,"" she said caustically.

The slave's shoulders hitched up and down spasmodically as she continued to weep beneath the damp cotton mask. When she was satisfied with the positioning of her soiled undergarments, Marta walked slowly across the room and stood over Victoria with her hands on her hips.",,2025-08-15T19:14:48.630670,3443,

College exploration

Well, I guess now is as good a time as any to tell how I got into this lifestyle.

It was during my sophomore year at State college that I found someone who liked watching me have sex with someone else. No, it was not my boyfriend at the time. It was June, my roommate, yes - just a roommate you perv! .

It happened one Saturday after a basketball game I had gone to with Doug, my then boyfriend. After the game and a stop at Potbelly for a sandwich, we went to my apartment.

Once on the couch, we began to make out. Kissing and fondling each other. Our hands explored and removed each other's sweatshirts and my bra.

It was then that June came home. Her eyes were slightly wide in shock, while mine were wide from surprise and lust.

""June, I thought you would be out longer,"" I said, my bare breasts visible as I sat astride Doug on our couch.

""Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you two."" June replied before going to her room.

The position of the couch and Doug's position prevented him from seeing that her door did not fully shut.

I have yet to understand why that turned me on, but it did far more than I thought it would. As I have said, June and I were not lovers, I am not truly even bisexual, but knowing she was listening made the sex that night better, so much better. So I like to be watched, sue me.

The first time being a ""Homewrecker""

During my junior year in college, I was at a popular off campus bar. The football game was an away game and many stayed back to watch on TV.

During the game I met Brad. He and I hit it off well enough. Then a woman stepped up. He introduced her as his wife, Melissa. Or was it Meline or Melinda? Hell, I don't remember so she can be Mel.

""Mel"" tried to pull Brad away, saying their meal had arrived. He apologized and started to go with her. I watched them go and then I got a devious idea.

I picked up my beer and went to their booth. They sat across from each other, which was perfect. I sat next to Brad, making him make room for me.

""So, do you take classes here? Live nearby?"" I asked, looking more at ""Mel"" than Brad.

""We, umm, we live about thirty minutes away, I went here,"" Brad said as ""Mel"" quietly ate.

I downed the rest of my beer before I said anything more. Liquid courage got me to ask, point blank, ""So you approached me Brad. You made a point of saying hello, then you walked away. What exactly did you plan to happen before She walked up?""

Brad and ""Mel"" exchanged looks. She looked down and he kept looking at his wife.

""Is this some kinky sex thing?"" I said just before the waitress came over. ""Mel's"" face became beet red as I ordered another beer, on their tab of course.

Once the waitress was gone I asked, ""Well?""

""Look,"" Brad finally said, ""We, well we were considering looking for a third but...""

I cut him off, ""Sure, I'm game. Got a room?""

Brad finished, ""But we don't think it is the right time.""

I felt it then - the rush of excitement. The thrill of the chase. I wasn't interested in her but the thought of fucking him in front of her? My panties were already wet.

I began to rub his thigh under the table. ""Look, it is up to you, of course, but I am sure I can make it memorable for you both.""

They looked at each other yet said nothing. I could tell they were getting cold feet so I said, ""Look, I'll tell you what. I will go back to the bar and sit. If you decide to go for it, I'll be there for about twenty minutes.""

It took only ten minutes. ""Mel"" came up and asked if I wanted to get some air. The three of us then walked two blocks to the Marriott. Me on one side of Brad and his wife on the other. She asked if I was bi and I told her, ""No not really. But you can do down on me later if you want."" This seemed to light a spark in them.

My intention was for her to watch me fuck Brad. Their intention was a threesome. So as I sucked Brad's cock, they made out.

Soon I was on top of Brad's cock as ""Mel"" sat on his face. She cupped and played with my breasts as I fucked her man before her. The fact I was fucking her man right in front of her was such a turn on for me. The icing on the cake was her openly fondling my tits and hard nipples.

She leaned in as if to kiss me. I grabbed her by the hair and asked her if she thought I was sexy? She said ""yes.""

I pulled her face to my left tit. She immediately began to suckle on my nipple as I climaxed on Brad.

I could tell she was close too but something came over me. I pushed her off him. ""Watch us for a while. You get him all the time."" My thoughts were proven correct as Brad's face was shiny with her creamy cunt juices.

'Mel"" said, ""Are you serious?"" Brad moaned and began to thrust up harder and faster.

""Watch from that bed, I moaned as I writhed on Brad and rubbed his chest. I really wasn't sure if she would do it but she moved to the other bed.

To my erotic thrill, she moved to the other bed. Immediately she began to rub her trimmed, wet pussy as she watched. I might not give a fuck enough to remember her name, but I do remember her swollen creamy cunt.

Brad did not last long after that. His cock pumped his big load into my pussy as we both moaned out. Just one more thing I love about a married cock is how pent up they get.

I laid on top of him as I watched her masturbate. Part of me wanted her to stop, to have that kind of demanding control over her. I didn't realize what a cuckquean was or even what I was at the moment. Being a cuckcake is so much more than just a romp with another woman's husband or boyfriend.

Once she finished, I got up and grabbed a bottle of water. I asked Brad if he wanted one but he declined. I did not offer her one. I paced the room naked as I drank the water.

I smiled as ""Mel"" got up and moved back to the bed Brad was in. Soon she was licking and sucking his cock. I joined them on the bed, kissing Brad and watching ""Mel"". Her eyes closed as she did. I said, ""Look at me as you taste me on him. Get him ready for another round.""

She opened her eyes and moaned. Brad looked at me and said, ""Oh fuck fuck fuck.""

I smiled as I could tell his cock was getting hard again. ""No hands, just your mouth,"" I then ordered.

Her hand moved away as she followed my order. Brad said, ""Damn you are so fucking amazing. You must do this a lot.""

I smirked, ""This is my first time. It is rather hot."" I was very aroused and knew this was what I needed sexually. I tapped her shoulder and nodded my head to the other bed.

Spit linked her to Brad's cock as she looked up at me and then to him. She moved to the other bed as I straddle Brad. ""Good girl. So, I think we can try a few positions this time, don't you think?""

I rode him on top for a while as I watched her looking on and rubbing herself. I only looked away when we changed positions. To missionary, then on my side and finally doggy style.

Only then did I say anything to her as she looked like she was coming over. ""Stay there,"" moaned out. I climaxed again soon after.

After Brad came, we laid together on the bed, making pillow talk as I thought about how I loved making her watch.

I then took a quick shower. Then as I dressed I promised to think about meeting up again soon at that same bar. I acted like it was fun, but did not let on just how much I enjoyed it.

As I left the room, smiling with my hand on the door, I knew this was different. I was different. Only later did I discover cuckqueans and cuckcakes, but right then, with Brad's cum in me, it was a kink I needed more of.",,2025-08-15T19:14:56.523056,1562,

*****

It was shortly after 7:00am on a Sunday morning. Janet knelt in front of the couch in her den. Having just handed a fresh cup of coffee to the short brunette, she asked in a tender voice,

""May I massage your feet?""

""Oh my! Is this how Sheri enjoys her coffee in the mornings?"" Jennifer giggled, unable to contain her excitement.

Janet was thankful to be back home and doing something. After no contact with her husband, Sheri or Jennifer all night. Everything had been planned by Sheri. Janet was to leave at 4:00pm and take her children to her parent's house. Her parent's thought it was ""date night"" for their daughter and her husband. They were only half right. It was date night for her husband. And he would be entertaining two women. Both cheered with their daughter on her high school cheer leading squad.

Their daughter would be cleaning Trey's newest Cuckcake's house that night. She should be able to clean the entire thing and still get a nap on the couch before she showered to return home. She was to return home at 6:00am and be prepared to make breakfast when needed.

It was to be Trey's first time fucking the 4 foot 11-inch-tall woman they went to high school with years ago. Sheri would be there to make it an incredible three-way for all of them.

Janet was puzzled by how close Sheri and Jennifer had become over the last few months. She couldn't put her finger on it, but it seemed as if Sheri had Jennifer as a submissive lover. Maybe not whips and chains yet, but Jennifer was always how Sheri wanted her to be. It was too odd to be coincidence. It had to be a sexual relationship of some sort.

The short woman's overly excited voice snapped Janet out of her thoughts. Janet knew Jennifer had always talked too much in school, so she would get all the details she could handle about last night.

""Trey's cock is SO BIG. I felt like it was hitting my stomach. A...and I've never been stretched like that. My pussy was soaked and he still barely fit in me. And his moans. Oh My God. I've never heard anything so HOT! When he whispered, I was the tightest woman he had ever been in, I came instantly.""

""He fucked me for like an hour. Well maybe 45 minutes, but I mean he pounded me. It was incredible! That's longest I have ever been fucked. Even when my ex was drunk, he couldn't last that long. I think he fucked Sheri before I got here. That helped him last so long. It was so freaking hot! Sheri was rubbing herself while she watched. It was just Trey fucking me while she watched. Ohhh My GOD! I want to fuck him again. My pussy is sore, but I would fuck him again right now if he wanted it.""

The chatter box finally stopped for a swallow of coffee before she continued.

""Sheri's right you know. A cock like that should be shared with other women. You don't deserve that cock. The three of us together deserve that cock. Well, more Sheri and me than you, but together the three of us can keep that big man happy. I mean, if he wants me, all he has to do is snap his fingers and I'll coming running.""

The room fell quiet as Jennifer took another couple of sips of coffee.

""Hey, when do you do your edges for Sheri?""

""I normally try to do both in the morning in case my day gets busy after lunch.""

""You want to do one now? Surprise her with one.""

Janets pussy went from damp to wet. Sheri had explained to the cuckquean wife that Jennifer would be given limited power over her. And over time the amount of power would grow if Jennifer wielded it properly. To serve both of her husband's girlfriends as a submissive would be humiliating. And so HOT!

""Um, I... I think you should make that more of a directive than a question."" she whispered looking down at the foot she was massaging.

""Huh? Oh. OH Really? It's like THAT, for me too?""

""Um, well. Not yet. Not completely. But I think they are considering giving you some control.""

""Oh Wow! Kiss my foot."" she giggled, barely able to contain her excitement.

""Well let's impress Sheri with my limited control of you. Go get your phone. Good, now give it to me. Sit on the other end of the couch and spread your legs.""

Janet obeyed. One foot on the floor with the other against the back cushion of the couch. She faced the shorter woman that had an evil grin on her face.

""I am going to make Sheri a little video of me edging you with my big toe. Can't get more humiliating than that can you? Besides, my big toe and your clit have a history, right? Look at how wet you are! Wow!""

It was true. Janet's inner demons had betrayed her allowing her womanhood to quickly become a dripping mess of decadent need. The small foot reached the excited crotch, and the big toe pressed against the throbbing clit. Slowly Jennifer slid her foot left and then back right. Letting her big toe slip off of the engorged clit one direction before dragging it back across it going the other direction.

She pointed the phone at her foot with a confident smirk on her face. She knew what to do to excite the cuckquean. And with a harsh edge she would impress Sheri.

""Do you like this, Janet. Hmmm? Your denied pussy getting excited by my big toe? The big toe of the woman that spent all night fucking your husband. Me having hot sweaty sex with Trey, while you cleaned my house. The gaping tunnel between your legs denied the pleasure he gave me all night long.""

Janet's breathing quickened. The superior sarcasm in Jennifer's voice was clearly having the desired effect on the denied cuckquean.

""You're not allowed to cum. That's what being denied is all about. We all enjoy hot sex and massive orgasms. While poor little Ms. Perfect has her sopping wet pussy forgotten about. You have to pleasure us and HOPE we enjoy it enough to think you've earned an orgasm.

""Oh god, Please."" the dark-haired beauty gasped.

""What's wrong, slut? Are you enjoying my toe so much you're gonna cum? Do you want to cum on my foot?""

""MmmmHmmm, please."" Janet nodded with her eyes closed.

""Say it, slut. Be loud and clear about it.""

""Please let me cum on your big toe. Pleeeeaaaase!""

""No! This is an edge for you slut. We are making a video for Sheri to watch and laugh at your predicament. How you are so close to cumming from just my big toe touching you. Knowing I am recording you. Do you think she will watch it over and over? Laughing at you. Enjoying your desperate need. Think she will watch it while you are eating her pussy? Giving her an orgasm while she laughs at you.""

""Oh GOD, I'm gonna...."" Janet moaned.

Jennifer removed her foot from the crotch instantly. Praying she removed it in time. A ruined orgasm would be cute, but a HARD edge is what Jennifer wanted to catch on video.

By some miracle Janet held on. Avoiding orgasm by what could have only been milliseconds. Her face contorted into something that could only be described as humiliated anguish. And the camera caught it perfectly.

Jennifer pounced, immensely excited by how hard the edge had been.

""Suck my toe clean slut. Thank it properly. That's a good girl. Now scoop some of your juices on your fingers and hold them up for the video.""

The cuckquean wife sucked the big toe that had just tormented her with pleasure. She slipped three fingers up through her ravenous pussy holding the goo covered fingers in front of the camera.

""That's a good girl. Now what do you say?""

""Thank you for edging me, Jennifer."" she said in a humiliated moan.

""Suck those fingers clean. This party is OVER!"" Jennifer laughed as she stopped recording.

It was some forty-five minutes later when Trey came downstairs in workout shorts and a t-shirt. Janet was in the kitchen making a second pot of coffee when she heard her husband.

""Hey Babe. I'm headed to the gym. Make me a coffee to go.""

She watched through the passage into the den as her husband leaned over the back of the couch and kissed Jennifer.

""Last night was fantastic. You are SO f-ing tight! Damn that was awesome!""

The kiss lingered and he groped one of the short woman's full breasts through her night shirt. He walked through the kitchen on his way to the garage. He grabbed his coffee from his wife's hand as he gave her a quick kiss on the forehead.

""Sheri's in the shower. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Call your parents and let them know we will pick up the kids late this afternoon.""

""Yes Sir."" came the quick reply letting Trey know his wife was still in submissive cuckquean mode. She was excited that she wouldn't be picking up the kids until late afternoon. Maybe it would give her some alone time with her handsome, well-hung husband. She craved some intimacy with him.

She picked up her phone to call her parents as Trey closed the door disappearing into the garage. She heard Jennifer stifle a giggle on the couch before her voice sung out.

""Make sure to tell your parents how much you've enjoyed yourself while they kept the kids!"" her evil grin could be heard in her voice.

After the quick phone call, the couch in the den was empty. Janet poured a couple of cups of fresh coffee and headed upstairs. She heard voices coming from the master bathroom. And then she heard Sheri's unmistakable laugh.

""Oh MY God. Go get her. This is going to delay our leaving for a bit.""

As she entered the master bedroom, Jennifer was coming out of the bathroom.

""There you are. I was just on my way to get you."" Jennifer beamed as she took a cup of coffee from the tall slender woman.

Janet entered the master bathroom where a naked Sheri stood applying her makeup. She quietly set the coffee mug on the counter as Sheri's eyes met hers in the mirror.

""That was quite an edge you had."" she smirked.

""Yes Ma'am. Jennifer had exquisite timing.""

""The video was made so I could enjoy it while you were eating me to orgasm. It would be a shame not to let that happen, right?"" she whispered as she picked up her coffee.

""Yes, it would be a shame."" the submissive replied watching the superior blonde sip her fresh coffee.

""Good. Glad we agree. Get on the bed on your back. I'll be there in a minute."" she said handing Janet the phone with the video playing on a loop.

Janet was on her back on the bed when Jennifer decided to join her. She sat next to the prone body and toyed with the thick, inch long nipples.

""This is exactly what I wanted to happen. I have used you to please Sheri. And now I will watch as she uses your mouth to get off while using my video to make it even hotter for her.""

Several minutes later Sheri emerged from the bathroom with her makeup done perfectly. Even completely naked she appeared regal and confident. By far the most superior woman in the room.

""Put your arms over your head and hold the phone where I can see it. So I can watch you debase yourself on video for me."" she laughed climbing onto the bed and straddling the cuckquean's head.

The clean pussy sat on her mouth as the buxom blonde grabbed the cuckquean's upper arms on either side of her head. Her hands humiliatingly holding the phone allowing the woman sitting on her face to watch the degrading video.

Janet's body quivered as her mouth started to pleasure Sheri's womanhood. The events of the last 18 hours or so fueling her insatiable need to earn an orgasm.

The memories running through her mind. 'Thrown out of her house so her husband could enjoy a night of sex with two women she went to high school with... Having to lie to her parent's about having 'date night' so they would keep her children... Cleaning the house of one of the women fucking her husband... Then coming home to prepare them coffee and breakfast as needed... Like a maid or servant in her own house... Massaging the feet of one of the women before being made to spread her legs and submit to having a big toe play with her clit only to have it stop just short of giving her an orgasm... Now on her back holding a phone so one of the women that fucks her husband regularly could watch the video while she orgasmed on Janet's obedient face...'

Sheri's pussy quickly dampened from the excitement and the cuckqueans well trained tongue. The video was pure genius on Jennifer's part. Exactly the type of thing that drove Janet's demented lust for further degradation.

""Last night and this morning have been quite the turn of events, haven't they slut? Your husband LOVES Jennifer's tight little pussy. And it appears you love her big toe rubbing your clit. And she is obviously a quick learner. Knowing exactly which buttons to push to make your denied body flush with excitement.""

The buxom blonde mashed her juicy pussy into Janet's face as she continued.

""I'm going to have Jennifer start a group text with you and I. She needs see your sticky fingers after each of your edges. Bye the way, I am giving you an additional edge every day. And it is Jennifer's edge. Now you have three a day. The Trey edge. The Goddess Sheri edge. And the Jennifer edge. Of course, I will randomly throw in extra edges at my discretion.""

Between the video and her own words, the blonde was rapidly approaching orgasm as she rode the beautiful face between her thighs.

""I thought I was done cumming when I got in the shower. But you had to go and be a complete horny slut downstairs. Making a video for me. You must really crave eating my pussy. The way you always seem to do things to get your slut mouth on my pussy.""

""Oooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, YES! Keep going slut! Yes! YES! YES! MmmmmHmmmm"" the orgasm came on fast but clearly wasn't earth shattering. After a night and morning with Trey's massive cock, nobody would expect it to be.

Janet and Sheri were both surprised that Jennifer had left instead of staying to watch the show. After getting dressed, Sheri instructed Janet to get a shower and shave herself well. Maybe she could beg her husband enough to earn an orgasm.

""I'll text him to let him know that you didn't get an orgasm today. If he denies you when he gets home, it's because he wants to see you lose your mind!"" Sheri whispered as she hugged Janet before leaving.

Trey got home and found his wife in the shower. Janet was excited that her husband joined her in the shower. She lathered her hands with soap and washed his broad shoulders, chest and abs. As she reached for his cock he pushed down on her shoulders. She obediently went to her knees and her heart sank as he forced his semi hard cock into her mouth.

She had desperately hoped he would reclaim his wife with his heavenly cock when he got home. She needed to feel his turgid member in her hot wet pussy. It had been so long since he fucked her pussy. Her mouth and asshole were taken regularly. She just needed him to understand her needs. And to know that while she was a deviant that craved being denied and humiliated, she still wanted him to fuck her like a normal married couple occasionally.

His cock was still semi hard as he grabbed the back of his wife's head and began to slowly fuck her face. Her heart sank further. Another face fucking for the female deviant that enjoys being submissive to her man and his other women. The slut who is driven by her need for humiliation and degradation. Being urged on by denial to make her crave the dark things even more. But what about his wife? ME? I'm still in here! At least some of the time!

Trey's massive cock began to swell to it's full thick potential. Gagging sounds echoed in the bathroom. Suddenly he withdrew his monster cock and pulled his submissive wife to her feet.

""Spread your legs."" he commanded. Immediately a strong hand gripped her pussy. His large middle finger sliding into her dripping pussy.

""I see some things never change. A throat fucking still makes you wet.""

He turned off the water and pushed the glass door open. Holding her firmly by the back of her neck, he took her into the bedroom. Both of them dripping wet. Janet feared she was about to get a rough ass fucking. And after all of the fucking he had done last night and this morning it wouldn't be a quickie. He pushed her toward the bed.

""On your back slut. And pull those knees to your chest.""

She quickly obeyed. He followed her onto the bed his huge cock bouncing in front of him. He grabbed the base of his large member and slapped it on her exposed pussy. The bulbous head thumping her tender clit repeatedly as he smiled down at her.

""I bet you could cum like this."" he sneered.

Janet nodded her head slightly. Her eyes wide wondering what would happen next. If he raised her knees up over her face lifting her hips higher off of the bed he could 'pile drive' fuck her in the ass. She thought about begging for lube.

""But I don't need that slut. I just want some hot pussy from my wife. Now wrap those sexy legs around me and let's go for a trip around the world.""

Janet would never know that Sheri's text to Trey said, ""Make love to her like a loving husband today. She needs it emotionally."" Sheri understood that the two of them needed a strong marriage if she was to keep fucking Trey while chasing Janet further down the degradation rabbit hole.

The husband's massive manhood slipped into his wife's ravenous pussy with ease. He went straight to fucking her. She let her athletic legs close around his hips. It was pure enjoyment physically and emotionally for the frazzled wife.

He lowered his chest onto hers and kissed her passionately. Their tongues intertwined and Janet's body shook. Her body flushed with heat as a massive orgasm flowed through her. After a long moment he broke off the kiss and pulled away.

""I've missed you."" he whispered with a big smile.

Janet was a bundle of raw emotions. So many thoughts rushing through her mind. So many emotions running through her soul. So many sensations running through her body. She opened her mouth but wasn't sure she could form the words.

""I love you."" was all she could squeak out.

He began to pump into her again. Her eyes rolled back in her head as her legs continued to tremble. Minutes seemed like hours as the thick cock continued a steady, gentle rhythm. She had forgotten how good his large manhood felt in her pussy.

""That's it baby. Show me how much you LOVE this BIG COCK! Cum for me. Cum all you want. It's ok to be a slut for my cock. I still love you.""

""OH FUCK!! YES!! YES!! I LOVE your HUGE FUCKING COCK!""

Janet let out a string of moans and groans as Trey slowed his pace. He stopped with his cock buried to the hilt in her spasming womanhood. He held her tight and as she enjoyed her second orgasm.

The next hour had been a fantastical wonder for Janet. Every ounce of her was completely satisfied. She had drifted off to sleep immediately after the marathon coupling session. She awoke just before 8:00pm to the sounds of her family downstairs. The children laughing as they played a game with their father.

Trey had picked the kids up and got pizzas for dinner. He let her sleep as he kept the kids downstairs with him. She had never felt more loved. She needed to shower before joining her family downstairs. To wash the sex off and get rid of her bed head. The warm water cleansed her to her core. She felt like the wife and mother of the perfect family.

The next morning, she got a text from Sheri that explained this was a week off for her. No edges were to be done, no denial for her and neither Sheri nor Jennifer would contact her. But she could feel free to reach out to them if she needed anything. The text also set a ""Girl Talk"" session at Sheri's house for the following Friday night.

****

Friday night Sheri wanted to start with a ""vanilla girl talk"" before they dove into the real ""Girl Talk"". The two shared a bottle of wine and giggled like schoolgirls. The lurid details of how well Sunday night had gone for Janet and Trey. Sheri commented on what a great man Trey was and how lucky Janet was to have such a beautiful family.",,2025-08-15T19:15:27.580159,3658,

After attending a charity auction in which she was outbid for her own husband, Alice and James have been blackmailed into service by Jodie and her upper-echelon friends. They have no choice but to do her bidding, letting Jodie pimp James out to clients, otherwise she will release the videos she took.]

---

OBEDIENCE TRAINING

I didn't tell James where I was going, which felt wrong. I slipped out of the house on the pretext of going shopping, but my bag was stuffed with lycra. I took the car and drove for half an hour, going across the city to a car park in front of a strip mall. There was a Harbinger's Home and Garden store, and next to it a coffee shop. I grabbed my bag and my phone and got out of the car.

I'd been doing some more digging, keeping tabs on Davis. Kikster had seemed to understand my interest in him, pushing his posts into my feed, showing me his life. His friends, and he seemed to have a lot, called him Davey, showering my Kikster feed with posts about nights out or weekends away, detailing an active social life and one thing that was of particular interest to me.

Time and time again, the same girl kept popping up, the owner of the gym I was now standing in front of. I hadn't said anything to James because he wouldn't have been swayed by female intuition, but the photos told me that the girl was important. I just had a feeling.

I pushed through the doors of the gym, finding a young man behind the reception desk.

""Hi, I'm booked in for an introduction,"" I told him, ""Alice.""

""Hi Alice, I'm Jaden. No problem, let me just get someone to help.""

I glanced at his name badge, noting the 'Manager' tag.

""You're the manager? Do you run the gym? I heard....""

Jaden shook his head, distracted by the booking calendar on the screen.

""No, it's Rosa's gym.""

""Sorry, I heard it was a husband-and-wife team, I just saw your name badge and assumed.""

For a moment, Jaden looked up from the screen at me, then he resumed typing.

""She set the gym up with her husband, Aidan, but he's, uh, on leave.""

Sometimes you just have to trust your gut. I pressed a little further, extemporising on the spot.

""I'd been recommended the gym, that Aidan was good. Is he available when he gets back?""

""I'm, uh, he's not available, sorry.""

I could see that Jaden was uncomfortable. I let the silence lengthen.

""He's on an extended break from the business,"" Jaden volunteered, ""But let me just get someone else to cover here and I can take you through the introduction.""

""I should get changed,"" I said.

""Sure, just over there.""

I went into the changing rooms and pulled on my exercise gear. By the time I was ready, Jaden was standing in the middle of the floor waiting for me. He gave me a tour of the gym, showing me the machines, the spin studio, the training mats. I was able to glean a few more details out of him, but Jaden remained tight-lipped on the subject of his boss and her relationships. But one thing became clear: the petite, toned, dark-haired woman conducting the spin class, the one taking a squad of women through their places, was the same woman I'd seen in the photos. Her name was Rosa, and her husband was nowhere to be found.

Jaden took me through a set of assessments. He was polite and professional, but my attention kept drifting back to the spin class in the other room.

""Looks intense,"" I observed.

""Yeah, they go hard. Gets results though. Are you interested?""

""I might be.""

""Well, if you wait a few minutes, you can talk to Rosa about it. They're just finishing up.""

I nodded.

""Anyway, let me get the plan entered into the system, and you can decide.""

""Thanks,"" I replied, ""I appreciate it.""

Jaden left me, and I wandered up to the doorway of the spin studio, listening to the music reach its crescendo. Rosa was working her group hard, and I watched them sweating and straining to reach the end of the song. When the music finished, Rosa clicked back a gear, sitting upright, her hands on her hips, letting her legs spin.

""Good work, spin it out, let's drop the rate. Grab some water.""

The class was a mix, but mostly women like myself, probably mothers wanting to stay in shape, skin gleaming, activewear dampened with sweat. At last, Rosa called a halt and one by one, the women dismounted the cycles. She came directly over to me.

""Hi,"" she said, ""I'm Rosa. You looking at the class?""

""Yes, though it looks like a lot of work.""

Rosa smiled, replying, ""It is. But it's also worth it. Good cardio. What are you looking for?""

""I'm not sure,"" I lied, ""I just came for an intro session.""

""Ah, good. Anything I can help with?""

I looked at her for a moment, suddenly unsure of my next move. I needed to ask about Davis, but I had no way to bring him up in conversation. I looked over her shoulder at the women now gathering between the spin cycles, and suddenly all thought of quizzing Rosa on her relationships blanked from my mind.

""Mix of ages,"" I observed.

It was all I could get out of my mouth, as my skin prickled. Rosa followed my gaze, turning to watch the women as they picked up their bags and sipped water from bottles.

""Yeah, they're a good group. Quite social.""

I barely heard the words. My eyes were fixed on a pair of women standing slightly to one side. The shorter one was perhaps a year or two older than me, with expensively styled blonde hair in a loose ponytail that reached down below her shoulders. The other woman was the centre of my attention though: taller, slimmer, older, long blonde hair threaded through with silver. Then I saw the eyes: ice blue, her attention settling on me for a moment before flicking back to her friend.

""I, uh,"" I stammered, ""I might have a think about it.""

""Sure,"" Rosa replied, ""Just let us know at the desk if you want to join a session.""

She smiled at me, and I returned her gesture, forcing my mouth into a smile too. Rosa turned and headed back over to the reception desk and her class began to file past me. The older woman was last, murmuring something into the ear of her companion. Her gaze locked on me as she approached.

""Hello,"" she said, ""New face.""

It was her, I was absolutely certain, the woman from the photo. She had been standing on the right-hand side of the shot, of all five people standing by the graveside, the only one looking up into the camera. The face that I'd studied endlessly over the past few weeks was now directly in front of me: her name was Cynthia.

""Anything I can help with?"" she asked.

I found that I couldn't speak. An electric shiver passed through me, staring into those merciless pale blue eyes.

""Ah,"" she said, ""So you know who I am?""

I nodded.

""And there's something I can help you with.""

It was a statement, rather than a question. I nodded.

""Shall we step outside?"" Cynthia asked.

""Okay.""

She made her way to the front doors and I found myself following her, as if mesmerised. I'd messed up, bad. I knew that I needed to get away from this woman, that I simply couldn't afford for her to relay anything back to Jodie. I felt a cold hand grip my guts and squeeze. There was no way to escape, the only exit was the way we were going and all I could do was follow behind, closer and closer to my doom.

Cynthia stopped outside, in the sunlight, turning to appraise me as I emerged from the gym.

""So,"" she began, ""Let's get one thing straight. I don't appreciate being stalked, not on my personal time. I understand that this is important to you, but turning up to the gym is inappropriate.""

I stared back at her blankly.

""Am I understood?"" she continued, ""I'm happy to talk in the club, but not randomly on the street.""

""The club?"" I echoed.

Cynthia's eyes clouded, her expression changing.

""Yes, the club. That's why, isn't it?""

""I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.""

The piercing blue eyes closed, and I felt the sudden immense relief of not being caught in the baleful glare of her gaze. She seemed to relax slightly, but my terror increased.

""So, this isn't about the club? You aren't looking for... uh, okay. Let's backtrack. I think I made an assumption.""

Her eyes fixed on me again, and she said, ""What do you want to ask me?""

""Nothing,"" I blurted, feeling the panic bubbling up, ""Look, I just came to check out the gym. I didn't mean to, look, this was an accident. Please, tell Jodie that.""

Cynthia reacted immediately, stiffening, her eyes hard as marbles. I felt my hands starting to shake. She reached out to me and I flinched away, surprised to feel her hand settle lightly onto my shoulder. She looked away, and I noticed her companion watching from a distance.

""Cassidy,"" she called out, ""I may need a moment. Do you want to go on ahead?""

""Okay,"" the other woman called, ""Flat white?""

""Real milk, please.""

The other woman nodded and began to walk in the direction of the coffee shop, leaving me standing alone with Cynthia, her hand still on my shoulder.

""First,"" she said, ""You know who I am but I don't know you. Or would you rather not give your name?""

""So you don't know who I am?"" I asked, feeling lost.

""To be honest, I have no idea who you are. What I do know is that you mentioned Jodie and you appear to be frankly terrified.""

Cynthia led me to a low wall and motioned for me to sit down with her.

""What's Jodie done?"" she asked.

""I, uh, I can't say.""

""Then I'll assume.""

She glanced down at my hand.

""Your husband?""

""Yes.""

""You too?""

""Yes.""

Cynthia turned away, resting her hand lightly on mine.

""I can't help you,"" she murmured, the corners of her mouth turning down.

I sagged, staring down at my feet.

""No-one can help us,"" I confessed.

""I wish I could. She's a very nasty piece of work.""

""So, you know her?""

Cynthia laughed, but it was hard, rasping, ""Oh, I know her. We're intimately acquainted. Let's just say I've seen the drama up close and personal.""

""You're not...?""

""Friends? Oh, no, not at all. I keep very much in my lane and she keeps in hers. But, how did you find me?""

""I can't say.""

""Can't or won't? Are you afraid I'm going to do something?""

I looked at her, confessing, ""Yes, very much.""

""Let me disabuse you of that notion, whoever you are. Whatever she's done to you, you have my deepest sympathy, but I'm in no way on her side. How did you find me?""

I hesitated, then got out my phone. I showed her the photo, of the five of them at the graveside.

""Richard's funeral. Oh, this was years ago.""

""You're standing with them.""

""Yes. It was a mark of respect. Ironically, that was probably the last proper conversation I had with her. Oh look, there's Delilah, and Andrew.""

Cynthia chuckled.

""Oh, they wouldn't have liked that, not at all. Everyone caught on camera together like that. Jodie would have been furious.""

""So, you know them all.""

""Yes. We go back a long way. But, things change.""

Again, I had an intuition.

""Alice,"" I told her, ""My name's Alice. My husband is James. I need help. We need help. We're trapped.""

Cynthia's attention remained fixed on the photo for a long while as I waited for her response. Eventually, she handed the phone back to me, shaking her head sadly.

""I'm sorry Alice, I can't,"" she confessed.

""Why?""

""You have to understand. It would be war.""

---

I got a message from Jodie the next day, asking to meet. The timing was suspicious, but I had no reason to suspect that Cynthia had given me away. I couldn't see how Jodie could have found out about my gym visit. Still, I made my way to the park with a feeling of trepidation.

Jodie was on a bench underneath the trees, looking at her phone. She seemed not to notice me until I'd come to a halt directly in front of her.

""Alice, please, have a seat,"" she said, without looking up.

I sat next to her, trying to read between the lines, as she put her phone away and turned her attention to me.

""How've you been?"" she asked, smiling pleasantly.

""Okay,"" I replied.

""Seems you've been making an impact. We're getting glowing reviews.""

""Good.""

""A couple of requests for a repeat booking. It seems everyone loves James. Isn't that nice?""

I ignored the little barb, replying, ""So, I guess you'll let us know where and when.""

""Certainly, Alice. I must say, you seem to have settled into your role much quicker than I would have expected. Perhaps you're enjoying yourself, do you think?""

She looked at me hopefully.

""Maybe just a little bit?"" she prompted.

""I'm happy that they're happy.""

""But, you do enjoy it though, don't you Alice? Watching your husband having sex with all those women.""

I sat up straighter, but Jodie seemed to see straight through it.

""You can admit it. It's perfectly fine. I imagine it's quite a sight, seeing James fucking other people right in front of you. Does it give you a little tingle?""

The way that she looked at me as she said the words triggered something deep within me, and unbidden, I began to relive the feelings of envy and powerlessness that surfaced each time I watched my husband with another woman, and Jodie was right: there was a little tingle deep in my core, remembering him pistoning into the willing flesh of another woman. I tried to supress the feeling, but I could tell from Jodie's smile that she'd already seen it in my reaction.

""Sitting there, just watching, while he fucks them. Does it get you a little heated?""

""What do you want, Jodie?"" I snapped.

I regretted it, instantly. I'd shown Jodie that she'd gotten close to the mark, revealing myself to her. Her face was beaming.

""Yes, we were very pleased. It really looked like we were hitting our stride with you.""

Jodie's use of the past tense sent a little shiver through me, as her smile faded. I didn't respond.

""Just refresh my memory though, did we have a little talk not long ago?""

""Which talk?"" I asked, warily.

""One about you not stepping out of line.""

""I don't know what you mean.""

""Ah,"" Jodie tutted, ""You see, this is the problem with amateurs. They all think they're Sherlock Holmes, right up until the point that they find out they're just roadkill. Anything you want to say?""

I remained silent.

""No? Really? It's going to be so much worse for you if you don't confess.""

""I have nothing to confess,"" I replied, keeping my expression neutral.

""Oh Alice, that's really not true, is it? Tell you what, I was hoping you weren't going to confess. I really wanted a reason to go to town on you. Thank you.""

""I think I'm leaving,"" I told her, but before I could get up, Jodie had wrapped her fingers around my wrist.

""That's the problem with you Alice, right there. Always thinking for yourself. You're not going anywhere. Stay.""

""Let go of me.""

Jodie ignored me.

""Trying to embarrass me at the gallery earned you both a night with four very demanding women. How much worse do I need to make it after I find out that you're sniffing around a gym, asking questions?""

She fixed me with a haughty expression, brimming with contempt.

""I mean, using your own name when you booked a session. Who does that Alice? A person of below average intelligence, surely?""

My heart raced, and I tried to supress the emotion mercilessly, but Jodie detected my reaction and I knew I'd lost. How had she found out about the booking? Unless....

""The poor girl's been struggling, really struggling, since her husband walked out and left the entire thing to her to manage on her own. She was more than grateful to let Davis supply some help. He's become quite hands-on with the business. Imagine his surprise when he went through the bookings.""

""I just went to look.""

Jodie snorted, cutting me off with, ""Oh, don't, please. It's clear across the city from you. You're insulting me now.""

Jodie leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur as she asked, ""Did James put you up to it?""

""No,"" I hissed, ""He has no idea I went. Leave him out of this.""

""Oh, now that's an idea. How about, I do leave him out of this like you appear to have, going behind his back like that, keeping secrets.""

She patted my hand. It took all my determination not to pull away.

""So I'll tell you what, how about we keep the next part secret too? Would you like that? Are you going to be a big girl and take your punishment on your own?"" she asked, ""Or should James share it with you?""

""Leave my husband out of this,"" I rasped.

Jodie paused, surveying me. She seemed to reach a decision.

""Okay, then I will. I'll even make you a promise, Alice. If you take it on the chin, I'm prepared to move past all this, your dues would be paid and we can pick up from where we left off.""

""Or?""

""Or I destroy your marriage. Would you like that instead? I could pick it apart, strand by strand. I'd even have fun doing it. Your call.""

I glared at her, unable to work out a proper response, my brain in turmoil.

""Saturday night, eight o'clock at Delilah's place. You don't have to tell James. Say it's, oh, what is it that you awful people do? Tell him it's Book Club.""

She patted my hand again and then rose to her feet.

""You don't need to dress up. Come as you are, the dowdier the better.""

Jodie began to walk away, leaving me in stunned silence on the bench.

""Don't be late,"" she called over her shoulder, ""It's going to be bad already. You don't want to make it any worse, trust me.""

---

I reached Delilah's house with time to spare. James had said he had a night out booked with the boys, which left me scrambling to come up with cover for my last-minute change of plans. I managed to arrange sleepovers for the boys, dropping them off with their friends, making conversation with their mothers, and all the while checking the time to make sure I wasn't late. There had been a strange look in my husband's eyes too, a question that he didn't ask. I didn't want to think about that.

I walked up to the front door and rang the bell, bracing myself. I knew that it was going to be awful, that Jodie would be putting me through the wringer. The fact that I was at Delilah's house hinted that other people would probably be involved. The door opened.

I was greeted by a young woman, petite and slim, slightly shorter than me, vaguely familiar. She didn't smile.

""Come in,"" she said.

""I'm Alice,"" I replied.

""I know. I'm Willow.""

Her name triggered a memory, of a young woman and a young man being auctioned off at the charity event, standing nervously on stage while attendees outbid each other for their services. It was the point that everything had gone wrong, when James stood up afterwards, putting himself up for the bidding, when Delilah bought his services. Jodie had just nodded into the crowd that night, and Willow had stepped up onto the stage. In hindsight, it was as if Willow was already firmly under Jodie's control, that it had all been prearranged.

""What are we doing tonight?"" I asked, following along behind her.

There was the sound of music from the back of the house, but Willow directed me into a room off the side of the hallway instead.

""Wait here.""

Willow left, and I looked around, trying to get a hint of what was in store for me. My heart was beating fast, a slow, oozing dread settling in my tummy. Willow's aloof demeanour had done nothing to calm my nerves.

""Alice, here at last.""

I turned back to the door. Jodie strode into the room dressed elegantly in eveningwear, her make-up immaculate, with Willow close behind.

""I'm on time, as instructed,"" I retorted, unnerved by her sudden appearance.

""Oh, that sounds a little passive-aggressive, Alice. Let's deal with that straight away.""

She crossed over to a set of drawers, pulling out a small item, shiny and black with straps. She held it up so I could see as she approached me.",,2025-08-15T19:15:31.937467,3588,
https://www.literotica.com/s/travelling-man-2,Travelling Man,Unknown Author,,,,,"1.

Chris checked his phone again for what must have been the 10th time in as many minutes.

7:14pm.

She wasn't meant to be here for another 15 minutes, but still, he was nervous in anticipation. His right hand drifted towards his left and he started to fidget with his wedding ring. It was something he always did when agitated. It wasn't a guilty agitation, it was pure excitement. He had stopped feeling guilt about cheating on his wife years ago. After all, he had her permission.

Chris and his wife Alice had a very loving relationship. They both loved being with and pleasing each other, but she also loved him pleasuring other women as well. It took some convincing on both sides and lots of trust was needed, but his wife eventually convinced him nothing turned her on more than knowing her man was fucking other women. She was a born cuckquean and married to a man who could fulfil her fantasies. Seeing, or hearing about her man cumming with another woman thrilled her to the core.

Her motto for the whole situation was:

'I don't want you to be good, I want you to be good at telling me about it'.

This meant that unlike other men who slept with women outside of their marriage, he didn't have to hide anything or be discreet.

He would usually tell her about his activities while his cock was buried deep in her pussy or ass, making her climax again and again as he recounted his adventures fucking faceless sluts. Often as they reached the climax of his story, he could time it so that his thick cock pulsed and shot his hot seed into her at the same time he came in the story. This drove her wild.

It wasn't unusual for Alice to lay across his lap and suck his member into her mouth as she rubbed her pussy with wild abandon as he reminisced about one of his conquests. His wife often squirted during these sessions, quivering with orgasmic bliss and soaking her side of the bed. Of course, he made her sleep in her mess before she could change the bedding.

Humiliation was a very important part of their lifestyle. All at his wife's insistence. An integral part of their sex life was him degrading her sexually and humiliating her both physically and verbally. It was not an uncommon occurrence for Chris to force his wife to roleplay as another woman while they had sex and have him talk about how much better she was than his wife. Noting how her body was smoother, her pussy tigher, her tits bigger etc.

Sometimes he was cruel and only allowed his wife release by having her hump his leg and foot, like horny little dog. She loved the degradation and embraced it whole-heartedly. Her particular favourite was him telling how much better another woman's pussy felt wrapped around his thick cock.

Travelling for work had its perks. He had lots of free time on an evening and a didn't know anybody in the areas he visited. He was completely free to be his own man.

When not there to fuck his wife as he told his stories, he would talk to her on the phone either just before he saw a woman, or after she left. Chris took great pleasure in telling reserved, demure Alice how his cum had looked coating the latest conquests tits, ass or leaking slowly out of her pussy and down her thighs as she left the room. In those instances, he would instruct his wife to play with her pussy, but not cum. Only he could give her that release.

If he wasn't there, she had to edge herself but stop when close to cumming. The penalty for this was her orgasm being denied for weeks at a time.

2.

Back in the bar, Chris was pondering the situation.

This woman he was here to meet tonight was not his wife, she was at home hundreds of miles away. This was Izzy, a woman he had met through work and with whom sparks had flew. Their flirting had increased and become more daring, eventually resulting in a rushed, animalistic fuck in a disused store cupboard one afternoon earlier in the week. Both had emerged a short while later feeling well fucked. They had used each other in a way that was almost brutal.

A stiff breeze from the open door of the bar brought him sharply back to the present and he looked up as she walked in.

Izzy was wearing a tight-fitting red dress with mocha stockings and matching red heels. Her hips swayed sensually as she walked towards table, eyes locked firmly on him. As she walked towards him the tight auburn curls of her carefully styled hair bounced slightly in time with her breasts. She was sex incarnate. She stopped in front of his table and coyly asked if he minded if she sat down. Chris smirked and invited her to join him.

Izzy's chest was heaving, and she had a slight flush about her. Chris smirked as he watched her. She always got so flustered when they were alone together, and he worked his hardest to keep the pressure on.

Their first encounter had been a long time coming. From slyly checking each other out during meetings, to extended eye contact when they spoke and lingering smiles, the pressure had been building.

The tipping point came the first one-to-one meeting they had about a particularly difficult part of the project they were working on.

3.

Alone in Izzy's office, they were discussing the issue. The proximity to one another had introduced a subtle, growing tension that both had been trying to ignore. They had both squeezed onto the same side of Izzy's desk in order to get a good look at her laptop screen. Papers and various folders were haphazardly stacked on the desk, reducing the space further. The two were elbow to elbow and trying their best to not touch. When they occasionally bumped as one of them shifted, an apology was quickly muttered, and a sheepish grin was flashed.

Chris was trying to explain a flaw in one of the documents which detailed the project timeline. He leaned closer and pointed to a certain row in a table;

'They're making matters very hard for us by delaying on this' he said forcefully. The tone of his voice was rougher than usual. There was a slight edge to it. Chris wondered if he would have got this annoyed this quickly if he wasn't frustrated in other ways. Being this close to a woman he had been having dirty thoughts about recently was a big part of the frustration he guessed.

Izzy leaned in closer, her head coming level with his. The smell was a mixture of perfume and something much more subtle. Something he couldn't put his finger on.

'I bet it's very... hard...' Izzy teased in a quiet, seductive voice. Her breath hitting the side of his neck in a red-hot whisper.

Chris' cock lurched in his pants hearing her say those words. His stomach tightened.

Slowly turning his head, the two locked eyes.

The tension had been building too long for there to be any finesse with what happened next. He lunged forward, smashing his lips into Izzy's mouth. He heard her gasp with pain as her lip split slightly and he tasted slight blood on his tongue. However, they were both too far gone to care. Izzy pushed back as their tongues wrestled and slid over each other. The kiss was wet, sloppy and passionate. Chris brought his right hand up and curled it tightly into the redhead's hair, pulling her against him.

Izzy moaned loudly into his mouth as she felt him take control. Feeling blindly, the young woman groped blindly for Chris' crotch and squeezed his shaft roughly. He was already fully hard and grunted as he felt her touch him.

Wasting no time, Izzy undid his belt with both hands and grabbed at his waistband, pulling his chino pants halfway down his thighs, exposing his angry member. Grabbing the shaft with one hand, Izzy braced her other hand on Chris' shoulder and started to stroke him rapidly. She could feel the hard pulsing of a powerful cock in her hand and it was driving her insane.

The feeling of the redhead's hand around his cock was causing an animal response in him. Abruptly breaking their kiss, Chris stood up and dragged the young temptress with him. Without saying a word, he yanked her arm until he was behind her and Izzy was facing the desk.

Running a rough hand up the back of her black tights, Chris lifted her short green dress and saw she was not wearing any underwear. Had he had a bit more self-control, he would have savoured the site. However, this wasn't the time. His brain was filled with a fog of lust and they both needed satisfaction.

""Slut"" Chris growled as he put a hand inside her nylon tights and yanked them down to just below her ass cheeks.

Izzy moaned as she felt a rough shove between her shoulder blades. Falling forward, her hands grasped the far end of her desk as Chris entered her swiftly and hard. Feeling him stretch her needy pussy around his cock caused a breathless scream to leave her mouth. This was quickly stifled by Chris hand across her mouth. They couldn't be sure they were totally alone.

The redhead began to scream more as she felt Chris' hand across her nose and mouth. Having her breath taken away was a huge turn on for her, as well as being taken roughly. This couldn't have gone any better if she had planned it.

When she was on the brink of passing out, Chris let his hand slip from her mouth. Izzy gasped for breath and pushed back against his cock until he was in her to the hilt. She could feel his balls resting against her clit and the feeling caused a deep spark of pleasure to tighten her belly. Shifting her weight forward what little she could, Izzy started to fuck the cock inside her. Picking up the pace and tossing her hips. She was fucking like a woman possessed.

Chris knew enough about fucking a woman to enjoy when one started to work his cock like this. He occasionally complemented her movements by thrusting forward into her as she came back, causing his cock to penetrate her more deeply, eliciting a moan each time.

Izzy was out to milk him, and she wouldn't stop until there was a load in her hot, tight pussy.

They continued like this for some minutes, Chris holding her hips so tightly she had bruises the next day in a curious hand print shape (which she explained to her oblivious boyfriend as getting jammed in a door she tried to dash through). Their quiet but desperate grunts adding to the sound of slapping flesh as they fucked as hard and fast as they could in the cramped little office.

Izzy was the first to reach her climax, moaning that she was about to cum. Chris quickened his pace in order to get himself closer to the edge. This was going to be a big load.

Their pace increased until the sound of sweaty body hitting sweaty body reached an obscene volume in the small room.

Losing almost all conscious thought, Chris leaned over Izzy, pinning her to the desk. He reached his hands out and pulled her head up by the hair to plant a rough, wet kiss on her mouth as he started to shoot rope after rope of cum into her sore and abused pussy. This triggered another climax for Izzy and she yelped into his mouth as she was powerless to resist the man desperately trying to breed her young pussy.

The thrusting slowed down gradually until they were two gasping figures joined by flesh. Pulling his soaking wet cock from her pussy, Chris excused himself to clean himself up.

When he came back, Izzy was laid on her back on the desk, her shoes forgotten on the floor and her tights now pulled down to the knees, which were spread wide.

A stir in Chris' cock told him this wasn't over.

""You made a mess"" Izzy said with certainty as she stared him in the eye.

""You need to clean this up. With your tongue""

Her pussy was leaking his cum in a thick white trail from her pussy, down to her beautiful ass hole. He could see the well-kept strip of pubic hair she had was matted with her own pussy juice. She had been just as turned on as he was.

Chris was happy to oblige as he fell to his knees in front of the young redhead. She rested her small feet on either side of his neck as he began to nibble and kiss at the swollen, red pussy lips. They looked puffy and sensitive.

Licking around, Chris made eye contact with the beautiful adulteress. Her stomach was rising and falling rapidly as a dull ache of pleasure radiated up from her pussy. This progressed to a full-blown orgasm as she felt Chris' tongue scoop a large glob of cum out of her ass hole and tongue it back into her pussy.

He continued to clean her like this for some minutes until standing back up. He leaned over her and let his tongue hang out. A large dollop of cum fell from his tongue into her open and waiting mouth. The mingled taste of both of their juices was ambrosia to Izzy.

The pair made out for several minutes before slowly parting. They proceeded to make themselves look presentable before calling it a day in the office. Swapping numbers after was a strangely awkward affair as they left the building, agreeing to meet up the next day.

Chris couldn't wait to tell Alice and did so as soon as he returned to the hotel. The story was repeated to Alice later that night as she frigged her sopping wet pussy looking at the pictures of his swollen cock glistening with another woman's juices. Chris had slowly stroked his fat hard cock as he told his tale. In a rare showing of mercy, Chris allowed Alice to cum at the same time as he did. Hearing his horny submissive wife scream with pleasure down the phone as he sat in his hotel room pleased him to no end.

4.

Back in the present, Chris politely asked Izzy if he could buy her a drink or if she'd prefer something to eat.

Looking him dead in the eye, Izzy said in a cocky voice;

""There's only one thing I want, and we can't get it in this bar. I think we should go up to your room.""

Chuckling slightly, Chris agreed and they both left the bar.

At home, Alice checked her phone for the hundredth time that night. A text message from Chris told her to assume the position.

Giddy with excitement, Alice ran to their room and turned the big TV on. There was a live feed of the hotel room Chris was staying in. He was leading Izzy in and directing her to the big bed that took up most of the screen Alice was watching.

As she removed her soaking panties and spread her leg, Alice was glad she was married to such a nerd. He had also given her permission to cum as much as she liked while he was with Izzy in that hotel room.

After hearing about the first time they had fucked, Alice was sure it was going to be an intense night. For all three of them.",,2025-08-15T19:15:38.631220,2648,

[Optional task: wear a bikini to a public place, such as a mall or restaurant. You may wear a sheer beach cover-up over it. Now enjoy the story.]

""I've selected your outfit for the day, my little toy,"" Jeremy said. ""I think the red bikini will look really good on you. And I like how it uses metal rings to connect different sections of fabric, instead of straps. I think that's cute.""

""Isn't it kind of... small?"" Scarlett asked. ""It's so slutty!""

Jeremy laughed and gave her a swat on her naked rear, eliciting a squeal. ""You know I love showing off my slutty little toy! Just as I know how much you love being embarrassed. I know that the more you blush, the wetter your panties get.""

""Masterrr!"" she protested. ""It's so embarrassing when you say things like that!""

""Yes, that's the point. Now get dressed, my pet.""

""Yes, Master. But the shoes - aren't sandals with six-inch heels a little impractical for the beach?""

""They'll be fine for walking around the boardwalk. Now get dressed, or I'll decide to use you again and we'll never get out to the beach."" He spanked her again and she bit back a moan.

""Yes, Master!""

Soon after they were walking outside. Scarlett wasn't used to wearing such a skimpy little bikini. Before she met Jeremy and became his submissive, she tended to wear one-piece swimsuits and modest outfits in general. But he quickly exercised control over her wardrobe, and many other aspects of her life - especially when he learned just how much it turned her on to be forced to wear outfits more daring than she ever would wear on her own.

At least she wasn't the only girl in a bikini here. There were all kinds of people here. She could see the beach, with people playing in the surf or laying in the sun. Closer by, people did some shopping. And some girls had outfits almost as revealing as hers - although none paired it with quite such high heels.

""Wrists behind your back, slut,"" Jeremy reminded her.

Scarlett quickly crossed her wrists behind her back. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered. Her owner liked it when she adopted submissive postures in public places, especially when people didn't realize there was anything naughty behind how she was holding herself.

Jeremy purchased an ice cream cone while Scarlett waited, silent and obedient. He liked to restrict her speech as well. At least that was easy. Shy by nature, having permission to be quiet and let her boyfriend take charge was soothing. Much easier than when he made her say embarrassing things out loud.

""Come along, kitten."" She followed obediently, keenly aware of the looks she was getting from men on the street, and some women. This bikini really was much smaller than what she was used to. She was half tempted to try to cover herself with her arms. But that likely would have just drawn more attention. And in any case, she was keeping her wrists crossed behind her back like a good girl.

Jeremy led her to a bench and had her sit down on one end. The nearby bushes were overgrown. Some of the foliage was pressing against her naked thigh.

""Keep your wrists behind your back,"" he instructed. He slowly took a taste of the ice cream, watching her. ""Want a taste?""

Scarlett leaned forward, mouth open, but he just pulled it away. ""Uh-uh-uh, my little pet. Would you like a taste?""

She looked around furtively, to make sure nobody was close enough to hear. ""Yes, Master. I would like some ice cream, please."" He insisted she address him respectfully, even in public - as long as nobody not in the know could hear them. She was always concerned someone would overhear her speaking like a slave girl. That would be so embarrassing. Even more so now that she was practically naked in this tiny little bikini!

""That's better."" He held the cone close enough for her to have a lick. Then he brushed it lightly against her cheek. ""Oh, clumsy me. I better clean that up."" He licked the ice cream off her cheek.

Scarlett squirmed on the bench. She had to remind herself not to move her hands. ""Master! People can see!""

He touched the ice cream cone to her neck. ""Oh, I am just so clumsy today!"" he licked at the spot, making her utter a ticklish squeal, and then sucked on the side of her neck firmly.

""Master, please! This is so embarrassing!""

""Mmm... it turns me on when you're embarrassed. Good girl. Now you may use your hands. Here, hold this.""

Scarlett pulled her hands out from behind her back and held the cone, feeling a little confused. Then his lips were on hers. He kissed her deeply, commandingly, his tongue invading her mouth. She tried hard not to let the ice cream cone fall. It was so embarrassing to have such a public display of affection! What would people think of her - a nearly naked girl in six inch heels, kissing like this in broad daylight?

She heard a soft click, and then he pulled away. ""Master? What did you do?""

He chuckled and tapped the side of her waist. ""Just making sure my little pet doesn't wander off.""

Scarlett looked and gasped. He had used handcuffs on her! One end was fastened to the end of the bench. The other was locked around the waistband of her bikini bottoms, matching the metal rings connecting the front and back. ""Master! People will see!""

""People will see what?"" He cupped her chin in his hand, making her look up at him. ""They'll see that you're a hot little bikini babe? They'll see that you're nearly naked, on public display in full daylight? They'll see that you're a helpless little toy waiting to be played with?"" He waited a moment. ""Answer me, girl.""

""Yes,"" she whispered. ""Yes, Master!""

""And how does that make you feel, my little slut?""

""I feel embarrassed, Master. I feel so small and vulnerable.""

""And?""

""And..."" she squeezed her thighs together and considered denying it. But she knew better. Her owner insisted she always be honest. ""And horny, Master.""

""Good girl!"" he patted her on the head, making her blush even harder. He knew how it affected her when he treated her that way in public.

""But Master, seriously, people will see!""

""Eh, no they won't. That bush will hide it, as long as you stick close to this end of the bench, especially if you keep your arm at your side to cover it. Nobody will notice. Now eat your ice cream, it's dripping everywhere.""

She obediently sucked and licked at the melting ice cream as he went on.

""You have a choice, my pet. Only the bikini is locked to the bench. Not you. And only the bottoms. You could simply slip out of it. Our room is right over there - it would take you less than a minute to get inside. And then you can wear whatever you want for the rest of the day. But... you would have to go in just your bikini top and high heels, exposed for the world to see, and lots of people would see you."" She whimpered. He gave her thigh a squeeze. ""Or you can wait here until I... remember you and come free you. Well, I say 'free' but you can expect more bondage today. You are just a captive toy, after all.

""You don't have to make your decision just yet. You have plenty of time! Sit there as long as you like and think about it."" He kissed her on the forehead. ""God, and to think this sort of treatment turns you on! You are such a shameless slut for getting so horny by being controlled and humiliated like this - ha! I love that cute little blush of yours. You must be soooo embarrassed right now.""

He stood up. ""Don't worry, kitten. I'll always be close by. You just remember to be a good girl and wait quietly for your Master.""

""May I have my phone, Master? If I have to wait here for so long.""

""No. It will be safe with me. Just enjoy the sights. Fantasize about the girls you see. And flirt with them if you get the opportunity. Other than that, just wait quietly. You're just a toy that's been put away, waiting to be played with."" Scarlett shivered and Jeremy laughed. ""Have fun, kitten.""

He walked away and she considered shouting out after him. Begging, saying that she would do anything - just don't leave her in this embarrassing position. Did he have to do it when she was wearing so little? Why not when she was fully clothed? Bad enough to be in bondage in public or to be practically naked, but both at the same time?

She finished off the ice cream cone and engaged in people watching. There were several girls coming out of a clothing store across the street, wearing big hats and light little sundresses. She envied them and wished she had a lot more clothing on. Or that she could go shopping. That would be a nice way to spend the time. Although clothes shopping was complicated for her. She secretly liked it when her owner made her wear revealing outfits, but she wouldn't pick them out for herself. At least, she usually wouldn't. Any time she did point out a daring outfit and suggest it, or try it on, Jeremy would shower her in praise and affection. But it was still so hard - it was so embarrassing to pick something like that for herself! It felt so naughty. It was much easier if he ordered her to wear something skimpy. Then she could tell herself it was his fault, and that she was a good, modest girl. Not a naughty little exhibitionist slut at all.

Jeremy was playing volleyball with a girl Scarlett didn't know. She was gorgeous. Her breasts bounced in a very distracting way every time she jumped. Her black bikini hugged her skin tightly and seemed almost as shiny as latex. She was also a redhead, and her hair hung long and loose. Jeremy loved long hair. He liked to pull it during sex, to grab it to lead a girl around, or even to use it as an impromptu gag.

Scarlett squeezed her thighs again. Too bad she was so exposed and visible. She wouldn't mind touching herself while watching that gorgeous girl jump and play. She bit her lip and squirmed on the bench. She imagined that girl pressing Scarlett's face into her ample breasts, covering her face with warm soft tit flesh. That would be so embarrassing! Scarlett suddenly realized her traitorous hand had slid up to nearly cup her breast. She quickly crossed her wrists behind her back, blushing. Naughty, naughty hand!

Soon after, the volleyball game finished - and the girl in the black bikini started walking Scarlett's way! Despite the ice cream from a few minutes ago, Scarlett's mouth suddenly felt dry. She tried to look casual - as casual as she could, feeling naked and exposed, still cuffed to the side of the bench and unable to move away. She nearly moved her hands out from behind her back, but managed to resist the impulse. Her owner would be disappointed if she did that just for a little thing like feeling shy.

""Hi!"" the beautiful girl said. ""What's your name?""

""Uh - Scarlett,"" she answered, almost tripping over her own tongue with nervousness.

""I'm Elizabeth."" Scarlett mentally kicked herself. She hadn't even thought to ask the girl her own name. Or do anything to try to keep the conversation going. God, she was so socially awkward! ""May I join you?""

""Uh, please,"" Scarlett said, nodding to the bench. Inwardly she was screaming no, no, no. This girl might notice the handcuffs! And if she did, Scarlett thought she would die of embarrassment. Now she did move her hands. She kept her right arm over her right leg, conveniently covering the handcuffs.

""Jeremy said you two came to the beach together. What can you tell me about him?""

God, she has such pretty green eyes, Scarlett thought. Oh right, Jeremy had taught her to flirt with every pretty girl she saw. ""You have really pretty eyes,"" she said. She mentally kicked herself again. Not the right time! Why was she so awkward? ""Uh, I mean, Jeremy, right.""

Elizabeth giggled. ""Thanks, hon. And yes, go on.""

""Well, he's smart and nice and is a lot of fun to be around!"" Any time she helped find a girl for Jeremy, he was very, very happy with her. And he also knew about her cuckquean fetish. Heck, for all she knew, this could be a kinky friend of his he had known for ages, and he staged this meeting between the two girls. Or maybe she was a complete stranger, and completely vanilla.

""I mean, is he with anyone?""

""Oh, we're in an open relationship,"" Scarlett said. She tried to sound casual, but couldn't help the fierce blush. ""A v-very open relationship."" Darn it! She wanted to sound cool and confident as she said that, not like a nervous schoolgirl! Unable to meet the other girl's eyes, she found herself staring at those large, bouncy breasts again.

""Is that so, Scarlett?"" Elizabeth leaned in close, her lips just inches away. ""I'm glad you think my eyes are pretty, hon. And they're up here, by the way.""

Scarlett wanted to crawl into a hole and die of embarrassment. If she wasn't cuffed to the bench, she would be tempted to run away. ""I wasn't - I mean, I'm sorry! I don't mean to be disrespectful, I just-""

""Shh. You're fine!"" Elizabeth said. ""I'm just teasing you. I think your eyes are pretty too."" She reached out with a fingertip and idly toyed with a lock of Scarlett's hair.

Scarlett swallowed hard, her heart pounding.

""So, Scarlett... I was thinking you and me and Jeremy could all get to know each other a little better! Maybe go swimming, get some lunch, something like that?""

""Oh, uh... that sounds nice, but... I really wanted to sit on this bench for a bit. Try to see the s-sights. You know, relax. T-tired!"" Scarlett stammered. Man, this gorgeous goddess must think she sounded like an idiot. What was she supposed to say? Oh, that sounds like fun, but if you look closer you'll see I'm a perverted nearly naked slut handcuffed to a bench in broad daylight, so I can't leave?

""You're sure you don't mind me spending some one on one time with your boyfriend, Scarlett?""

""N-no, not at all, Elizabeth. He's really great company, I'm sure you two will get along great!""

""If you're sure, Scarlett. Too bad. I would love to get to know you better too. A lot better.""

Scarlett's eyes were focused suddenly on Elizabeth's luscious lips. Just inches away. So close. Too close. She might die of embarrassment if another girl were to kiss her in public! While she was in a really skimpy bikini! And handcuffs!

Elizabeth pulled back. She did a frisky little shoulder jiggle, drawing Scarlett's gaze to her bouncing boobs. She winked at Scarlett and then walked off to rejoin Jeremy.

Scarlett rubbed her thighs together. She almost started touching herself, then clenched her hands on her thighs and bit her lip. She forced herself to put her wrists behind her back again. She shouldn't be this horny in public! That was such a dirty thing to do! She really wanted to be a good girl. She couldn't help it if her body betrayed her by getting turned on by perverted things.

She saw Jeremy and Elizabeth having lunch at an outdoor table under an umbrella. She watched some other girls making a sandcastle. She wondered how it would feel to be buried up to her neck in sand, completely helpless and unable to escape. To have those pretty, bikini-clad girls belittling her, telling her what a dirty slut she was. Or maybe they'd ignore her. Just leave her helpless and trapped while they enjoyed each other's company. Maybe if she displeased them, they would put a bucket over her head so she couldn't even see their beauty and would struggle to hear them talking to each other about how pathetic she was.

She really hoped her juices weren't making a stain on the front of her too-small bikini bottoms. She tried crossing her legs. Hopefully that would look casual. Ooh, that felt nice. She tried uncrossing and crossing her legs again, squeezing her thighs against each other.

Then a middle aged couple walked down the sidewalk nearby and she froze with embarrassment. God, she couldn't be trying to stimulate herself in broad daylight like this! She struggled to maintain her composure and hold still. That's it. Just one more girl in a bikini, relaxing near the beach, just watching. Nothing to see here. Nothing unusual at all, nope.

She saw a girl in a bikini with a butterfly pattern on each cup fetch cold drinks for her friends. What would that feel like? Maybe some mean girls would make her their beach bitch for the day. She would have to do their bidding. Fetch their drinks and food, but they might not give her permission to have any. She would have to massage suntan oil into their skin, covering every inch of those beautiful, tanned angels...

Oh, why did she have to be so horny?

Part 2

[Optional task: pleasure yourself in a pool or hot tub where other people are around. You may use a waterproof vibrator or your fingers. Now enjoy the story.]

It felt like forever when Jeremy finally came over to her - with Elizabeth. Uh oh. They both had devious smiles, and Scarlett suspected they weren't done teasing and humiliating her.

""I bet you're ready to get out of those cuffs,"" Jeremy said. ""Not to worry... we'll be making good use of them later.""

Scarlett blushed furiously, looking at Elizabeth. The blatant reference to the bondage didn't seem to faze her at all. In fact, the other girl was looking at Scarlett with hungry eyes.

Jeremy bent down and unlocked the handcuffs from both the bench and her bikini as casually as possible, using his body to shield them from view. Then he slipped them into the pocket of his swim trunks. ""Up, my pet."" He took her hand and helped her to her feet. Then he pulled her tight against him and gave her a long, deep kiss. ""I'm proud of you, my little slut. It was so hot to have you bound and wearing so little in public.""

He released her and Elizabeth immediately slid in, hugging Scarlett tight against her, their breasts pressed together. She also kissed Elizabeth. ""You seem like you could be a lot of fun, hon! I'm looking forward to getting to know you better.""

Scarlett's hands were free again, but not for long. Jeremy took one of her hands firmly in his and Elizabeth took the other. Then they pulled her along to the beach. They looked simply like an affectionate trio, but Scarlett knew the truth - they were controlling her hands as strictly as if she were tied up. She couldn't even scratch her nose. Her hands were trapped in theirs, and she could do nothing except go where they led her.

It felt really, really nice actually. She felt a warm tingle. Not just arousal. Sure, there was that as well. She felt delightfully submissive and controlled, and that sent shivers of delight through her. But feeling the physical contact with both of them made her feel... connected. Cared for. She could feel the affection they had for her.

""Time for a swim!"" Jeremy said with a wicked smile. They splashed into the shallow water, and Jeremy led them out to an area of shoulder deep water away from other swimmers.

Elizabeth put her hands on Scarlett's shoulders. ""Look me in the eye, hon. Tell me honestly. Jeremy says you love it when he brings in other girls to tease and humiliate you. He says you become a dripping wet slut when he ties you up and makes you watch him bang another girl - and that you get hungry for their pussies, that you're an eager little subbie cunt muncher. Is that true? I said look me in the eye, hon!""

Scarlett was beet red with embarrassment and had looked away, not daring to make eye contact. At the command, her eyes snapped to Elizabeth's. To fall into her beautiful green eyes. ""I-I- well, that is...""

""Yes or no, hon.""

""Y-yes,"" Scarlett whispered. Then she immediately let out a surprised squeal. Jeremy had yanked her bikini bottoms down! He dived underwater, pulling them off her ankles. He surfaced again, tucking the bottoms into the pocket of his trunks.

Scarlett placed both hands over her princess parts, even though nobody could see her nakedness underwater.

Elizabeth giggled. ""I'm so glad to hear that, hon. You do seem so fun to tease! We're going to go back to the beach to relax. Will you be joining us?""

Scarlett whimpered and crouched down in the water so only her face was exposed. Being handcuffed on the bench was bad enough - at least she was clothed then!",,2025-08-15T19:16:12.781770,3595,

SLEEPING WITH GHOSTS

Flashes of light, fragments of pain. Whiteness, then the howl of noise like a thousand car radios turned up way too loud. Faces. Voices. A crushing pain that was stopping her from breathing, like knives stabbing into her lungs whenever she tried to snatch a breath. Her mouth opened but no sound came out.

In all this, words, and a strange swirling gravitational motion, pulling towards her head and then towards her feet, and then pushing her back into, what? Soft leather? The smell of leather. Familiar. Car leather. The sound of people screaming at each other.

She screwed her eyes closed as the pain washed over her again, opening to see a gap between seats and a body through the gap. Black dress, bare legs, skin the colour of coffee, hands gripping a steering wheel. A man's grim voice from the other seat, the words: ""Fuck the lights.""

Hands pressed against her cheeks, the feeling of a body supporting her head. A familiar face above hers. Blonde hair, tears. Looking down her body, another woman, older, her face set in grim determination. White heat in her chest again as she tried to breathe.

Darkness.

---

Light.

Birdsong.

Soft white sheets. Syn opened her eyes.

She found herself in a room painted in ivory and cream, with a high ceiling. She turned her head and could see that the wall next to the bed was given over completely to windows in wooden frames. They were open, letting in a warm, spring breeze. The air was so clear. Syn took a tentative breath, fearing the return of the crushing pain but finding it all gone away. Her lungs filled with crisp, clean mountain air.

She sat up in bed, looking out at the view of distant, towering peaks bright with snow. There was a knock at the door and Syn turned to greet the visitor. A man walked into the room without waiting to be called.

Syn considered him for a moment. He was middle aged, well built, with short hair gone prematurely silver. He was dressed in a polo shirt and jeans, casual yet understated. He entered the room like he owned it, lighting up his face with a dazzling smile that made Syn's heart melt. He crossed the floor and perched himself on the edge of her bed.

""How are you, poppet?""

For a moment, Syn couldn't speak, fighting to control the emotions roiling inside her.

""You may speak freely, I permit it.""

""I... I'm well,"" Syn managed, cursing herself for her clumsiness.

""I'm here, like I promised. Are you happy to see me?""

""Yes. Very much,"" she managed, weakly.

He frowned. ""Did you think I wouldn't keep my promise? That you would never see me again?""

""I... I don't know,"" Syn stuttered, ""I began to doubt.""

At this, he leaned towards her, gathering her up into his arms. She buried her face into his neck, taking in the scent of him.

""You should never have doubted me, poppet. You are the most precious thing in all of this world.""

He held her for a long time and she was content to listen to his breathing, basking in the feeling of being held in his arms.

""It feels like an eternity since I last had your body against mine,"" he murmured. ""Have you missed me?""

""More than you could possibly know.""

She felt the rumble of his laughter through his chest.

""Oh, I think I really could possibly know. Being separated from you has been the hardest thing I have ever had to do.""

He broke off the embrace, leaning back, running a hand through her hair.

""And how have they been treating you here? Madame Roberte tells me you've been progressing in leaps and bounds.""

Syn didn't reply, not trusting herself to say the right thing.

""What's the matter?"" he asked, ""You must tell me what's on your mind.""

""I,"" she stammered, ""I'm, uh, I....""

He laughed again. ""It's not a trick question, I promise. What do you think's going to happen if you tell me the truth?""

""I'm not permitted.""

""You are now.""

""Matrone hasn't permitted me.""

He shook his head. ""Look at you, all tied up in knots. Where has my Cynthia gone, the woman who hunted me down through the crowd?""

Syn found herself lost for words again, looking into his eyes.

""She's still there, I hope,"" he continued, ""Just now aware of the limitations on her behaviour.""

The warm smile faded. ""I was very explicit about that, that you shouldn't be altered. So, tell me, how have they been treating you here? That's no longer a request.""

Syn considered her options, looking for a hint in his expression but finding nothing. She knew what she wanted: her body burned for it. She also knew that asking for what she wanted would prolong her agony. At last, she formulated a response.

""I'm chaste,"" she replied, ""For a hundred and sixty-eight days. Master Yves has helped me take control of my body, helped me not to succumb. They have been hard on me, but I have learned all my lessons.""

""Almost six months without release,"" he mused, ""The old Cynthia would not have managed it. As I recall, she needed release every day.""

He reached out and cupped her breast. She permitted his touch without reacting, feeling her body secretly betray her as her nipple hardened beneath his touch. He stroked her breasts, teasing a finger around the bumps in her shirt.

""You need it so desperately, don't you?""

Syn nodded with a twinge of fear that the small admission would be enough to warrant a reprimand. The rules were now simple. He could extend her denial by an arbitrary amount of time as he saw fit, as punishment. She locked eyes with him, awaiting his verdict.

""I understand,"" he said, ""As I said it's been hard on me too, separating from you like this. I have something to tell you.""

The tone of his voice alerted her, sending a tremor of panic through her. She braced herself, letting his hand continue to fondle her breasts, roaming wherever it wished. His fingers traced down, over her thigh, sliding beneath the hem of her nightdress and up between her legs. Fingertips arranged themselves over her waxed mons. She didn't dare move, waiting for the moment of contact.

When his thumb plunged between her lips, she gasped, but he didn't smile. His face became more serious. She looked at him with a burgeoning dread, even as the exquisite thrill ran through her aching body of his thumb gliding up and down her slit.

""I had to find a substitute while you were away,"" he confessed, ""She has been willing and entertaining, and we have built a good rapport over the last few months. I know how unfair it must feel, thinking of me with her at dinner, or in a club, while you were kept here, far away from me.""

He paused, but the thumb kept stroking her, slick now with her moisture.

""In bed also,"" he told her, ""She's been keeping me satisfied between the sheets. As I said, she's been very willing.""

Syn gasped, involuntarily. He had always been clear that his needs would be met however he saw fit, and she had accepted that about him. But, she was still stunned by the admission that he had been free to enjoy the body of another woman whenever he wanted for months while she had been denied even the pleasure of bringing herself to climax.

""You look like you have a question,"" he observed.

""I do.""

""Ask it. You know you need to.""

Syn's mouth was dry. She swallowed. ""Who?"" she croaked, fearing his answer.

He actually smiled at her, his thumb dipping inside unexpectedly, brushing her clit and making her shiver in anticipation. Her body was betraying her, allowing itself to be brought to the edge. She waited for his answer, dreading and expecting the name he would give her.

""Jodie, of course.""

Syn's eyes fluttered closed and she let out a little tortured groan. He had taken her rival to bed, the one woman Syn had been afraid of losing him to. Suddenly, the nights spent alone in her bunk, aching with need in the dark, came back to her. She had tortured herself with the scenario, of Jodie getting her hooks in while Syn was removed from the scene, making a play for the man who Syn loved passionately. Jodie's body against his in the middle of their night, moving in exquisite synchrony, had been Syn's abiding nightmare.

""I told her I was coming to visit you, do you know what she said?""

""No,"" Syn replied in a tiny, lost voice.

""She said she hoped you'd learned your lesson.""

Syn crumbled, imagining the pretty face mouthing the words, the look of triumph in her eyes.

""She was very good about everything,"" he continued amiably, as if they were simply chatting, ""She said that if I decided to bring you back, she would find space in our life for you. She'd let you share me. What do you think of that?""

""I....""

It was all she could say, her mind plunged into despair with his words even as her body screamed out from the attention of his thumb.

""She was very interested in your orgasm denial, and what it had done to you. She said that it sounded very useful.""

So, he had discussed it with Jodie, telling the other woman everything, giving her everything she needed to keep Syn squirming under her thumb. She felt the waves of bliss from his intimate touch and the overwhelming humiliation of being bested by the woman she'd been locked in bitter contest with. Jodie always played to win.

""She had an interesting observation on that,"" he continued.

Syn grimaced, finding herself trying to fight back tears now, the shame of her defeat overwhelming her at last.

""She suggested an arrangement. When I brought you back home, Jodie would remain in my bed. We would find somewhere for you to sleep. She suggested a mat on the floor.""

Syn gasped, picturing herself naked, huddled up on the carpet while her rival rode the body of the man Syn loved to climax, night after night.

""She said we could involve you. You'd be permitted to get me hard for her. She also suggested that you could be ordered to make her wet for me. How would you like that, poppet? Your pretty mouth at work on us both, then you could watch while we make love?""

Hot tears flooded down her cheeks.

""Do you think I would like that? Would you like to be kept in denial and used as a part of our foreplay? You could watch us fuck, but Jodie suggested that you should never be allowed to pleasure yourself.""

The thumb paused.

""Open your eyes, poppet.""

She complied, blinking rapidly to clear the tears from her vision.

""Would you take that life, if offered? To be our toy? To serve us both when we needed it and go without yourself? If that was what pleased me?""

Syn felt his thumb, nestled over her entrance. She looked into his eyes. She felt the burning anguish from the thought of Jodie taking control of her because it would please him to see it. She could imagine the smug, superior look on Jodie's face as she instructed Syn to pleasure her. Jodie would be merciless, humiliating her at every opportunity.

""Yes Master,"" she whimpered.

His thumb plunged deep inside her and Syn came, gushing over his hand as her orgasm surged through her, powered by need, denial, helplessness and a hopeless, irresistible love for the man in front of her.

He didn't move, allowing her to ride out the savage waves of her first climax in months as her vaginal walls contracted around his thumb, revealing the depths of her need, showing him how much his words had affected her, shaped her. That was the worst part of the betrayal, that her body had told him how much she wanted to be debased like that.

At last, he withdrew his hand, bringing it up to her face, showing her his gleaming fingers, bathed in her juices.

""Good girl, poppet. Now lick up your mess.""

Obediently, she opened her mouth, permitting him to insert each finger, licking and sucking her moisture off each digit until he was clean.

""Are you ready to come home?"" he asked, gently, ""To begin your new life?""

""Yes Master,"" Syn replied.

The tears began to fall again, but he cupped her cheek tenderly with his hand. He lifted her chin and kissed her on the lips.

""No tears, poppet. This is a happy day, isn't it? You passed.""

""I did?""

""Yes.""

Syn blinked, reeling. ""A test?""

""Your test. To either walk away, or to submit yourself completely. Or do you regret your choice?""

Here, at last, was his real question, the reason he had sent her here in the first place. Would she take the life he offered her, the position he gave her?

""I told you,"" he continued, ""I laid it out. Monogamy, children, the white picket fence, remember? It's not me. You've had time to think, on your own in this place. What do you want, poppet? Where do you belong?""

""I belong to you,"" she said, simply.

""And I belong to you poppet. That's the truth. I satisfied myself with other women while you were here. That's also the truth. I brought Jodie into our bed to satisfy me, night after night. I enjoyed her thoroughly, that's the truth too. But what I said, about the three of us, I don't want her in our life. That was a test.""

His face was grave. Syn found herself searching his eyes, seeing compassion there.

""I love you, poppet. I miss you. Do you think you're ready to come home with me? To live with me, for all the days from now on?""

""Yes,"" she gasped.

It was as if the floodgates were opened. Tears came, but happy tears this time. He swept her up in his arms. Syn closed her eyes, content to feel him holding her, finally, after all the months apart. She felt satisfied and at peace.

""Madame Roberte gave me a full report on your time here,"" he told her, ""The Matrone is not an easy person to impress, but you succeeded. She told me how lucky I was to have you. I told her it wasn't luck. I told her it was my privilege to have you in my life.""

She could see the honesty in his face, the admission that Syn exercised that hold over him. He meant every word he was saying.

""Let me make you happy,"" she told him, ""Permit me to show you what I can do.""

""I permit it.""

Syn knew it was against the rules, the strict code of abstinence and self-denial, the focus on obedience, control, elegance, worthiness, as opposed to the base mechanics of fucking. But she was no longer striving not to give in to her carnal desires. At last, at long last, she was being called on to please her owner.

Syn disrobed, sitting cross-legged before him, naked. She looked down at herself, her firm, high breasts, her unblemished skin, feeling the long, lustrous strands of her blonde hair cascading about her bare shoulders. Her body was soft and full, perfect curves, enticing, not sculpted by hours of effort in the gym, worked on ceaselessly to maintain her figure. Her body was supple, beautiful, glowing with the energy of youth.

She felt his eyes on her, the colour rising in her cheeks to expose herself like this before him. She shifted her hips slightly, arching her back, bringing her chin up. The motion lifted her breasts, thrusting them forward to stand proud before him in a way they hadn't done for years, her body rendered young again before the man she had always loved. He reached out, cupping them in his large hands, and her body thrilled to his touch.

""Undress me,"" he murmured, no longer a command but an invitation.

She came towards him, tugging his polo shirt over his head, reaching down to his belt buckle, unbuttoning his jeans. He raised himself up, letting her strip him, revealing his manhood, stirring, nestled in the space between his legs. Syn's eyes were drawn to it, a familiar longing unfurling within her, a remembrance of how he felt inside. In her darkest moments in the institute, she had cried herself quietly to sleep, imagining his manhood standing before her, replaying the look on his face as, like she did now, she bent over to take him between her lips.

Syn took her time, remembering her lessons, taking care to please each part of him, worming her tongue into the sensitive ridge between his head and his shaft, sucking on him. She was rewarded with a shuddering sigh from him, and a twitch of his cock. Syn felt a little special glow, feeling the effect she was having on the man she loved.

""I've missed this,"" he groaned, ""Such beauty, degraded....""

His words trailed off, lost in the sensations as Syn began to bob up and down on him, slowly, her lips constricting around his shaft. He felt solid, unyielding, harder than she had ever felt him, as she listened to him groan in bliss from her delicate attentions to his manhood.

She had slickened, herself, the ever-present ache now unbearable, each taste of him in her mouth an agony. Syn was teetering on the brink of her own orgasm, brought to the edge by nothing more than being permitted to suck him. She felt herself sliding, wanting to fall deep into that longed-for submissive space, giving herself completely to him. She wanted to feel his body around her and inside her, powerful, commanding her to please him. She wanted to obey.

Instead, she popped off the tip of his cock, looking up into his eyes. She could see his need for her, the confusion on his face as she broke off contact.

""I want to show you,"" she breathed.

""Okay,"" he rasped, his eyes lidded with passion.

Syn positioned herself carefully, straddling him, her entrance over the purple tip of his cock. She lowered herself down gently, surprised by how big he felt, how completely he filled her. She sank down until his root was pressed up against her clit, his entire length subsumed into her body. Syn wrapped her arms around him, burying her face in his neck.

Her crotch was pressed against his, the hard nub of her clit against the base of his manhood. She didn't pull up and begin to move, instead she clenched him inside her, feeling him react as she began to milk his cock within.

Syn rolled her hips, keeping him embedded fully, using her muscles to tighten around him, working to a steady cadence. His hands settled on her buttocks, lifting her slightly so that he had a little motion to drive up into her. Syn permitted it, concentrating on clamping hard when he'd penetrated her completely, enhancing the sensation around his cock as he struggled to withdraw.

The orgasm was there, hovering on the horizon, but she ignored it, as Master Yves had taught her, focusing on the bliss of her man's rigid erection inside her. Syn denied herself effortlessly, all her focus on building her lover up to his climax through nothing more complex that clenching herself around him

""Poppet,"" he groaned, ""New tricks. Such beautiful tricks.""

Syn didn't reply, gripping him tighter inside, until he was struggling to withdraw.

""You're so tight,"" he hissed, ""It feels like....""

Once again, he didn't finish his sentence, swept away by the glorious sensations in his cock. Syn was hovering on the edge now, teetering on the precipice after nearly half a year without his body inside her.

""Please master,"" she gasped, ""May I cum?""

He grunted beneath her then stared deeply into her eyes.

""No,"" he replied, denying her cruelly.

Syn merely accepted his judgement, increasing her tempo, milking him, feeling him slide in and out, grinding her own swollen clit against him. She allowed herself to fall, giving in at last, dropping deep into that secret submissive space she craved. She felt his passion, the effect her body was having on him, and merged into it, her body becoming an extension of his, each pulse of his cock within her sending shivers of pleasure through her body.",,2025-08-15T19:16:26.908825,3501,
https://www.literotica.com/s/laurie-and-shellie-ch-02-husband,Laurie and Shellie Ch. 02: Husband,Unknown Author,,,,,"This is the second part of Laurie's fantasy that she's sharing with her friend Shellie. I'm sorry it took me so long to write the second part. Thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts on the first part. I think I responded to everyone unless your feedback didn't include a way to respond. I appreciate all thoughts and suggestions on the story or anything else. And I appreciate your encouragement.

++++++++++++++++++++++

Shellie couldn't believe how excited her friend made her. Her best friend and occasional lover Laurie managed to drive her to erotic heights with her fantasies. Her visual teasing of a married man and then fantasy about taking a married man was so decadent that it was really just a fantasy at least until Laurie acted on it and it became an obsession with Shellie too. Now the whole scene was Shellie's constant daydream and longing. She wanted to know more and couldn't wait until she heard again from Laurie.

She and Laurie weren't lovers, not quite. They did play together and share intimate secrets and fantasies. And no one else ever made Shellie quite as comfortable with her inner lustiness. But this was her new obsession. She couldn't stop thinking of her dirty friend taking a married man. She pictured watching them every time she touched herself now.

It was Friday night and she was waiting for Laurie to call. She was hoping and eager, almost obsessed. As she walked in the door to her house, her cell phone rang and she eagerly answered it. ""I've been waiting for you my delicious friend. I've been a little obsessed about you and your latest fetish which is turning into my fetish.""

Laurie was very pleased with her friend's reaction. She wanted her to be thinking about it constantly and things could not have gone better. It was clearly time to move to another level with her friend.

""Shellie, I'm so happy you can share this with me. I was more aroused telling you in the bar than I was when I was there and taking the married man I had chosen for myself. I took him because I wanted him but I need you to be part of my acquisition too. Have you been thinking of this? Have you been imagining me? Watching me? Seeing me? Are you thinking about right now? Be honest with me, my slut, you're starting to get excited right this second, aren't you?""

Laurie was exactly right about Shellie. Shellie was on fire. She was thinking about her friend and every second getting wetter. In fact, she was so happy to be alone at home and seated on a chair and had a hand under her skirt her imagination going wild in conjunction with her friend's words. She twitched when her friend called her ""my slut.""

When she spoke, she found her vice was breathless. ""Laurie, please, you are making me crazy. This is all I think about, like you cast a spell on me. This isn't just a fantasy, it is consuming me. I want you to take any man you choose. I want to see it, to hear about it, to witness your possession. He is so lucky to be chosen by you, to be taken by you as your own, and I am lucky to be part of it. I'm lucky to hear about it and to see it all if you let me. I don't care that he's married. That makes it better and lustier. I would say it doesn't matter but actually it makes it better. You want him and you took him from his other woman. She can't compete, she can only let him go. If she knows or when she finds out, she won't even complain. She'll know you're better and you deserve whatever man you choose to take. If she's smart all she'll want to do is watch and feel honored that you're doing what used to be her man. Laurie, I'm almost dripping now, my hands are shaking.""

Laurie smiled to herself and was very pleased that Shellie was reacting just as she should. After all this was about Shellie too not just Laurie. Shellie's reaction and excitement made her happy.

""Shellie, darling, do you want to see something? Can you come over to my place and I can set it up so you might be shocked or fulfilled? It's Friday night and everything is falling into place. Can you be here at 7? Please?""

Shellie agreed, her husband was working late so she was free to go. She got to Laurie's nearby house early and tried to wait but ended up knocking ten minutes early.

Laurie smiled and said, ""so eager."" Then she took Shellie back to talk while she finished dressing.

Shellie was nervous and excited and asked, ""what do I do? Do I come with you? Won't the guy see me? Do I hide? Where are you meeting?""

Laurie took Shellie's hand to calm her. ""Hush, darling. You can wait here. See this chair in from of a TV screen? I have a camera planted at his house in their bedroom! He doesn't know but you get to watch everything. I think you'll be amazed. Now take a seat here.""

Shellie was trembling at the thought of watching her friend with anyone. And this wicked fantasy made it even better. She looked at the screen and sat down in the chair even though it would be a while before anything happened.

By this time Laurie was ready to go and had texted the man who told her the coast was clear. She turned to Shellie and put restraints on her wrists quickly. It took Shellie by surprise.

""Shellie, don't worry. I've always wanted to tie you up and how fun it is that you're tied in my bedroom. I'm shifting the restraints up your arm a little. I have the key but you should be able to move your arms a bit in case you have an itch you need to scratch.""

Laurie was so seductive and fun that Shellie didn't complain but took it all in as part of the erotic moment. ""Damn, Laurie this gets more wicked by the moment. I'm like a captured girl entertained and restrained by her mistress. And a good thing it is because I'm so thrilled I can hardly see straight. I can't wait to watch you, to watch you fuck some woman's husband. Oh. Oh.""

Laurie just smiled and hurried away to her plan. She only had to drive a short distance and she just let herself into the house and found her prey. The man was as aroused as Shellie had been and it was easy to get him into the bedroom. And while his back was turned, Laurie snuck over to the one dresser and flipped on the hidden camera making sure to wiggle her tongue for the camera.

Back home Shellie saw the camera start and cried out. She could only see Laurie's tongue and then her back blocking the camera shot. She could hear Laurie but most of the man's speech was muffled so far. But she did hear Laurie say ""I'm going to fuck you in your wife's bed and I really wish I could have her watch it happen.""

The man must have been on the bed watching because the next Shellie saw was Laurie reaching behind her and unzipping the back of her skirt, the part facing the camera. As the skirt dropped she saw black panties framed by a garter belt. She heard Laurie telling the man to stroke slower.

Shellie watched and realized she was getting very wet. She didn't touch herself yet because she would have had an orgasm in a minute or two. She watched carefully as Laurie took off her blouse and threw it aside and walked away from the camera toward the man. Shellie's eyes were on her friend filling the frame of the shot. She couldn't hear the man but finally saw his naked legs. She was thrilled. Her friend was about to take the man and was letting her watch. She was a little jealous. She and Laurie were so much more than friends now. As her friend straddled the married man's knee, she could see Laurie grinding away and she was jealous of the knee. Her beautiful friend was really her lover she decided and she was a part of this. She wanted Laurie to fuck him. She wanted her to take the married man and make him her own. That's all that mattered.

Shellie's hands were tied but she was just able to reach down and touch her own panties and feel her own wetness. She was excited and lost in this naughty moment. She watched as Laurie started to kneel before the man, the lucky man who was lucky just to be wanted by Laurie.

As the picture opened up, Shellie recognized the bedroom. It was familiar. The man's face became visible also as Laurie knelt down to take him in her mouth. He looked familiar to Shellie. It was her husband staring down as wonderful, sexy Laurie knelt down and gave him a blowjob. Shellie stopped rubbing her panties but couldn't look away. She didn't know how to feel and she was confused by her own feelings. Anger and lust are a strange mix of feelings.

Shellie was tied up, shaking, and unable to look away. Very soon, Laurie stood up and turned around and then lowered herself onto Shellie's husband. With her eyes closed she started bouncing slowly. It made Shellie angry to watch. Her friend taking her own husband. The bitch.

Then Laurie opened her eyes and moves faster. She looked straight into the camera and smiled. It was a very sultry, sexy, dirty smile. The smile of a woman staring through the camera at her best friend while she rode her husband's cock deep inside her. Shellie would never admit it but it made her touch herself and groan loudly all alone and all tied up. She said out loud even though no one was there, ""you bitch, how dare you?""

But as angry as she was and as true as that part of her feeling was, there was another part. Her hands weren't agreeing with her voice because her hands were touching herself. She was tied up but could touch. She slipped her hand inside her wet panties and played with herself. She didn't realize it but her hip were moving to help fuck her hand just in the exact same way her best friend was moving her own hips up and down on Shellie's husband.

Shellie groaned as she heard Laurie on camera lean forward and say, ""Oh that's perfect, that cock feels so good deep inside me. I'm getting so close. It feels so good. I bet your wife never fucks you like this. I wish I could see her face as your warm cum explodes deep inside me while you fuck me in her bed.""

Shellie's husband wasn't talking. He probably didn't even here everything said because Laurie was facing away from him and talking into the camera. Shellie could feel Laurie's eyes making contact through the camera and holding her. Laurie would know that Shellie couldn't help herself. She was teasing her, torturing her, and bouncing on her husband. ""Oh yes, yes, I can feel that cock throb. Come on, baby, thrust deep inside me, yes, just like that Oh yes, oh fuck yes! I feel it and I'm going to come too. YESSSSSSSSSSS."" The whole time Laurie held the camera with her eyes and stared through it so Shellie saw the orgasm and could sense the moment her husband came too.

Shellie came too and was still shaking minutes later when her slutty friend finally recovered enough to speak. Laurie flicked her tongue seductively at the camera and almost whispered at it, ""I hope you came too, that's a good girl.""

Then she heard Laurie say to her husband, ""I'm borrowing a pair of panties. I wouldn't mention it to her. I have to go now darling. I want to leave before your wife me fucking you in her bed but I need your cock inside me again soon. Try not to think of me every time you fuck her.""

The she giggled and they both left the room. In a few minutes the camera went off. Maybe Laurie had a remote in her car. Then nothing. Shellie sat there with her panties wet from her orgasm but not even knowing what to think.

Twenty minutes later Shellie hadn't heard the door but felt breath in her ear and her friend whisper and she leaned down and stroked Shellie's panties ""Oh so wet. I guess there was something good on the monitor.""

Kendra lay in her hammock looking up at the underside of the Argo's weather deck. Her cheeks ached slightly from smiling so much. She figured that she must've been smiling in her sleep for them to feel like this. She used a bit of mana to heal the over-strained muscles, and then smiled at the necessity of doing so.

""You awake?"" Selene called from another hammock.

There were four hammocks in the ladies' area, arranged in a square. Anthiel slept in the forward starboard hammock and Rachel had previously slept in the forward port hammock. That put Selene in the rear starboard hammock and Kendra in the rear port hammock, which had been Alana's at one time apparently.

""Yeah, why?"" Kendra leaned out slightly and looked down so she could see the drop-dead gorgeous Brazilian woman, who was doing the same. They slept with their feet facing each other.

""Just curious."" She replied. ""I've been laying here trying to find my mana for a while now, but I can't even feel it.""

""Finding your mana can take a while; it did for me.""

""I'll keep at it then."" The Brazilian woman sighed. ""I just hope I'll be good at something for a change.""

The dragon huntress looked up at her. ""What do you mean?""

Selene hesitated, then shook her head. ""Never mind. Rachel said that there's a theory that a person will have an affinity for the first kind of magic that's used on him. Do you think there's any truth to that?""

""That's an old wives' tale."" Kendra shook her head. ""However, one of my teachers said that if a person had a strong experience with magic before he learned to manipulate his own mana, he might have an affinity for the magic that was used on him.""

""Oh?""

""Yeah, he said it was like baking bread."" She explained. ""The strong magic pushes the bread into a shape, and then learning to move your mana is like 'baking' the bread so it stays in that shape.""

""Interesting."" The Brazilian woman mused. She sounded...

Sad?

Disappointed in herself?

""Is something wrong?"" Kendra asked.

""I keep getting my ass kicked by Ethan in training, and there's not much I can contribute here besides my sword arm, so I feel kind of useless.""

""He's been practicing a lot longer than you have. It'll take time.""

""I appear to have a lot of that.""

""Oh?""

Selene nodded, then leaned back into her hammock. ""Yeah. It'll be a while before we get time to deal with Smithbond and I get to go home."" She made a thoughtful sound. ""Well, at least I'll get to go home temporarily.""

""Yeah, from the sounds of it, the secret government organizations are just as bad on Ethan's world as they are here.""

Selene looked up again. ""You sound as if you speak from experience.""

Kendra hesitated before replying. ""I've seen things.""

The ex-FBI agent made a thoughtful sound. ""I asked Taloni about you a while back, and she said that you said you were a 'problem eliminator'. Sounds pretty first hand to me.""

""Fair."" Kendra replied. ""I hear you were a constable of some kind on Ethan's world. How did you achieve that without knowing the sword?""

""We used guns, and I'm a pretty good shot.""

Kendra nodded, remembering that Ethan had described guns when recounting his story. ""Well, I can't get a gun for you, but I can certainly teach you how to handle a sword better. In fact..."" The dragon huntress looked around the room. ""...we can do a little sparring before breakfast down below, since it's important to learn how to fight in an enclosed space. Interested?""

""Absolutely!"" Selene replied.

* * *

Beth woke up with Ethan's arms around her and Taloni's gently fluttering wings tickling her back. She giggled and looked at the Fey, who appeared to still be fast asleep.

*Morning angel.* Ethan said with a smile, though she could feel the edge of the dragon through their bond.

*Good morning Dominus.* She thought back as she snuggled closer to him. *I really missed this while you were captured.*

*Me too angel, me too.* He replied. *Fortunately, you should never have to deal with that again.*

*I hope so.* She replied with a sigh. *My father will be really mad that you married more women than just me though, so I'm worried he'll try to separate the others from you. I know they'd hate it as much as I would.*

*Never. Going. To. Happen.* The dragon thought back, and if he'd been speaking it probably would've come out as a growl.

*I'm glad, but he still won't be happy about your other wives.*

*I thought that was legal here?* He replied, a bit of Ethan coming back.

*It is, but--* The blonde stopped as she heard a contented sigh from Ethan's other side. She lifted her head to see Rachel and Alana sleeping in each other's arms, the redhead's back snuggled up to Ethan's. She couldn't see Rachel's face, but Alana looked rapturously content.

She frowned. *Is it just me, or do they look almost... I don't know; like a couple?*

Ethan chuckled. *You finally noticed huh?*

*Wait, 'finally'? This isn't new?*

Ethan outright laughed at that. *Not by a long stretch, but I don't mind. Actually, I think it's kind of cute.*

*Oh.* Was all Beth could think to reply. She vaguely remembered learning that some women liked other women the way women like men, but she'd never met any of them.

Well, apparently she had.

""Hmm?"" Rachel yawned as she started stretching, probably woken by Ethan laughing.

""Somfing fny masser?"" Taloni mumbled as she also started waking and stretching.

About a minute later, three bleary eyed women were yawning and stretching while Beth enjoyed snuggling with their husband. As usual, Rachel was a bit more reserved about her stretching, and she made sure the sheet was covering her while she did. Ethan retracted his wings and lay on his back, pulling Rachel closer on his left and Beth closer on his right. He looked at his two remaining wives, then frowned.

""Well ladies, we've got this huge new bed, let's see if we can't get everyone snuggled up with the new space.""

Alana rolled so she was lower than Rachel and Taloni mirrored her, so the two women were laying with her heads on Ethan's stomach, while the other two were laying their heads on his chest. He reached down as far as he could and managed to sort of get his arms around all four of them.

""Ah, that's better."" He sighed looking at all of them.

Beth smiled at him, so incredibly grateful that she was here with him. She found it odd, but she even liked his smooth scales against her skin.

""So, you were about to explain why your dad doesn't like multiple wives."" Ethan said to her.

""Yes, so his mother was a second wife."" Beth explained. ""But his stepfather -- my step-grandfather -- didn't really want to marry her. He was kind of pressured into it because she was his brother's widow, and she needed someone to provide for her after her first husband -- my grandfather -- died.""

""I take it she wasn't treated well?"" Rachel asked.

""No, she wasn't."" Beth nodded sadly. ""It really is a shame; Grams is such a nice woman, but she had a hard life and was treated very badly.""

""How badly are we talking here?"" Ethan asked.

""She was basically made to be a maid, near the level of a slave."" The blonde said sadly. ""The other wife was treated very well, and so were her kids, but not Grams or her kids. My father and his siblings were basically servants in the house. I once heard Grams saying that the only time he paid any attention to her was when she made a mistake or he wanted sex.""

""That's awful."" Alana's face fell.

""It doesn't happen often, but I've heard of marriages like that."" Rachel said with a similarly sad expression. ""The Book of Light is clear that husbands must take care of their wives, and usually a husband is castigated by the community if he doesn't. If he doesn't straighten up, the community will 'correct' him for it.""

""Why didn't that happen here?"" He asked.

""My step-grandfather was good at hiding it."" Beth replied. ""Apparently, he would occasionally beat her but make sure the bruises didn't show, and then he would be nice to her in public, but basically ignore her in private. Well, unless he wanted something.""

""Oh."" Alana cocked her head to one side, like something had just occurred to her. ""Your father is worried that'll happen to you because of Ethan and I. He wanted to marry me originally, but he was sort of pressured into marrying you, and your father is worried that Ethan will be like his stepfather.""

""I would guess so."" Beth nodded. That made a lot of sense, and she kind of knew it somewhere in the back of her mind but hadn't really thought about it consciously.

""Hmm, so I need to convince Lord Borden that I won't treat you like that."" Ethan mused.

""I don't think

you

can."" Beth replied. ""Grams got to be the perfect little actress and she was able to convince anyone that she was madly in love with her abusive husband and was so grateful that he'd married her. I'm not sure anything you or I said would make a difference.""

""And I don't suppose anything his other wives said would carry weight either."" Rachel added.

""Gram's fellow wife was also pretty mean to her in private, but treated her like a sister in public."" Beth shook her head. ""So probably not.""

""What about Anthiel or Serif?"" Taloni asked. ""They know you all treat us well master, maybe they could vouch for us?""

""That might help."" Beth said. ""But I doubt that alone would convince my father. He might assume that Ethan is good at hiding it.""

""I mean, I literally fought a necromancer and crossed worlds to bring you back from the dead."" Ethan pointed out. ""Won't that count for something?""

""Maybe!"" Beth exclaimed brightly.

""I wouldn't be so sure."" Rachel said as she backed off a bit and propped herself up on her elbows, though the sheets still covered her pretty well. ""Things like this aren't usually logical; they're more emotional. If he had a bad experience his entire childhood, it'll color his view of everything without him realizing it.""

""Yeah, good point."" Ethan frowned, then looked at Beth. ""And you don't think that Anthiel or Serif's word would be enough?""

She smiled back into his green, cat-like dragon eyes. ""It won't hurt, but I doubt it'll be enough to convince him.""

""I hate to say this, but we should think about the worst case scenario."" Rachel said.

Ethan grimaced. 'Which is?""

The redhead took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""He could take the Argo. I doubt he'd hurt any of us, if for no other reason than you're reputed to be a prophet of Illuminar. But the Argo does belong to him; we're technically just borrowing it.""

""That would be bad."" He nodded.

""Especially for Kendra."" Taloni pointed out. ""We just told her last night that she could make the Argo her home.""

""Yeah."" He sighed. ""I think she'd be okay if she could stay with us, and worst case scenario we could get passage back to Nalatia. I'm sure The King or Navaro would put us up for a bit, and maybe get us another airship, but I'd rather not."" He looked around the captain's cabin. ""I don't know, the Argo is really starting to feel like home.""

""Now that Kendra's is here?"" Taloni gave him a teasing smile.

He rolled his eyes and chuckled.

""Regardless, we should tell Kendra."" Alana suggested. ""Especially given the invitation for her to stay with us last night, she should know.""

""Agreed."" He nodded.

* * *

""Get off the horse.""

Sarah jerked awake from her attempt to sleep atop the horse. It was early morning and they had been riding all night. Not fast, but continuously. They had taken so many turns on the roads that she was hopelessly lost and obviously quite far from home.

""Hey, chin up; it'll be okay."" Lady Ekthros said from beside her, though she looked quite worried at the guards around her. Sarah was incredibly glad that she was here; she had been nothing but kind to her.

They had stopped near a large earthen ramp which led up to an airship that was docked at the top. The soldiers were dismounting and tying their horses to nearby horse hitches. It looked like a tiny little outpost. They'd exited the forest, and she could see unfamiliar rolling green hills stretching into the horizon. Despite the situation, it was a good view and she was grateful for it.

It cheered her up slightly.

She silently prayed. *Illuminar, I know I can't escape this, but please help Lady Ekthros escape. She's been so nice and I would hate to see something bad happen to her because of me. And please make me good.*

One of the soldiers roughly pulled her off the horse, grabbed her by the arm, and started half-pulling, half-dragging her towards the ramp up to the airship. Lady Ekthros wasn't far behind, being likewise pulled along by another soldier.

They were dragged onto an airship which was about the same size as Ethan's, though not nearly as nice. The wood had an aged look to it, like this ship was old and not very well taken care of. It was clearly a military vessel, and the dozen soldiers milling about the deck made that obvious.

She gulped.

They brought the two women below decks and dragged them to the rear of the ship to a small steel cell. Sarah and Lady Ekthros were roughly thrown into the cell and the door was locked behind them.

""Now I don't want no trouble from you bitches, you hear?"" One of the soldiers said. He had a nasty wart on his cheek and didn't look like he even knew what a bath was; the stench coming off him was all but confirmation of that. ""You cause us any trouble, and I might just let the boys have some fun.""

He made a lewd thrusting motion with his hips to drive the point home.

Lady Ekthros gave him a scathing look while Sarah retreated behind the older woman. The auburn-haired woman didn't look as scared as Sarah felt, but there was a waver in her cold expression; she must be scared too, just hiding it better.

He scoffed and left the room, leaving the two women alone.

Sarah sat down, pulling her knees up to her chest and wrapping her arms around them. It would be okay, at least she hoped it would be. Gabriella had promised that life would get hard, and this was certainly hard. But it would get better.

The angel had said so.

""Hey, come here."" Lady Ekthros said as she sat down next to her and pulled her close, wrapping her arms around the innkeeper's daughter. ""It'll be okay; we'll get through this.""

Sarah nodded, wishing more than anything that Ethan was here. He could help. He was the prophet of Illuminar and such a good man. He could help... if only he knew.

Sadly, he didn't.

""We can figure a way out of this."" Lady Ekthros said.

""I wish..."" She said, then stopped.

""You wish... what?"" The auburn haired woman prompted.

""I wish the prophet of Illuminar knew that we were here. He could help."" She admitted.

Something about the older woman's body language changed. She suddenly seemed stiffer and less open, like she knew something that she didn't want to share.

She spoke after a moment, but did so in a very diplomatic tone. ""Maybe he could.""

""You don't think he would?"" Sarah asked.

""I didn't say that exactly."" Lady Ekthros said delicately.

""But you meant it, didn't you?""

She hesitated a moment before answering. ""I'm... I'm not as convinced about him as most people.""

""Why?""

""I really shouldn't say."" She replied.

""Why?""

""He's..."" Lady Ekthros hesitated, then shook her head. ""It doesn't matter; he's not coming so there's no reason to shatter the image."" She said this, then inhaled sharply like she'd said too much.

Shatter the image?

What did she mean?

She'd met Ethan and knew him to be a good person, but Lady Ekthros seemed to think he wasn't.

Why?

She was an advisor to a lord, so perhaps she knew something that other people didn't? She couldn't imagine what it would be though. Given all that he had done, it seemed impossible that he wasn't a good person.

He must be a good person...

Right?

* * *

Kendra mostly listened as Ethan and his wives laid out the situation with Lord Borden over breakfast. When they had finished, she asked the only question that was on her mind. Well actually she hesitated, took a deep breath and then asked.

""If you're forced to leave the Argo, can I come with you?""

""Of course."" Ethan replied immediately. ""I meant what I said last night. And while it might not be on the Argo, you're welcome to travel with us wherever we go.""

""Thank you."" She nodded. ""Then, I have a confession to make: I think I'm partially responsible for Lord Borden knowing that you have multiple wives.""

""Oh?"" Beth asked.

""Yeah."" Kendra replied to the blonde. ""He asked about you when I went to confirm Ethan's story. I didn't want to give anything away, so I simply said that you were happy and getting along well with your fellow wives. I thought that was the minimum I could say to put a father at ease. I'm sorry.""

Ethan shrugged. ""He would've found out anyway.""

Beth nodded. ""It seemed like half of Ivernia knew that Ethan had multiple wives by the time we stopped to pick up Selene, so he would've found out soon anyway.""

""There's another thing."" The dragon huntress said. ""He sort of insinuated I wasn't welcome in the city anymore after I told him that I wouldn't let Taloni be hurt or separated from you.""

The Fey beamed.

""I mean, you can stay outside if you want."" Ethan said. ""We can drop you somewhere outside the city and pick you up when we leave if you'd prefer.""

She hesitated only a moment before shaking her head. ""No, I haven't broken any laws and he'll need something significant to charge me. Plus, if I arrive with all of you it would seem suspicious if something happened to me. I'd like to come with.""

""You're welcome to."" Ethan smiled.

""So, what should we do when we arrive then?"" Kendra asked. Then she realized that she had just included herself in the Argo's crew by saying 'we'.

Hmm.

She liked that.

""I'm not sure there's much we can do except hope for the best."" Ethan said. ""I figure we'll just tell him what happened and hope he understands.""

Kendra noticed that Beth glanced down slightly and bit her lip. ""Beth, you don't think that will work?""

""I hope it will."" The blonde replied. ""I know one thing about my father though; he often says that 'talk is copper, actions are gold'.""

Selene chuckled. ""Yeah, we have a similar saying on Earth.""

""I'm not sure what actions we could take to convince him though."" Ethan said rubbing his chin.

""Also, you might not want to tell him that I died."" Beth grimaced. ""He won't take that well, despite the fact that I came back from the dead.""

""Maybe master could tell him about his conversation with Illuminar."" Taloni suggested with a slight flutter of her wings. ""Surely that would help.""

Beth shook her head. ""I doubt it. No one else was there to corroborate the story.""

""Well, you could tell him all about Gabriella then."" The Fey countered.

""Then I would have to tell him that I died."" She replied. ""That wouldn't be good. Like I said, one of my father's favorite sayings is 'talk is copper, actions are gold'.""

""We should all brainstorm and see what we can come up with."" Ethan shook his head. ""We have a couple of days before we arrive.""

After breakfast ended, Kendra realized for the first time that she didn't have any idea what the Argo's crew did to pass the time. She helped clean up from breakfast as best she could, though she didn't know where anything went. It seemed that Selene had sort of taken over that job though, and she felt slightly in the way.

Ethan's wives all followed Alana to the boxes containing the weapons that Graflex had forged. The wood elf started enchanting by the looks of it, and the others helped by donating mana. Taloni donated first, and when she was done she walked up to Ethan.",,2025-08-15T19:17:13.485252,3549,

There's guilt here. A need to make amends. But Tasha doesn't apologise with words - she brings him a young, tight, inexperienced, but sexy offering and watches him take it. She wanted to give him everything. And she did. Right there in front of her.

------------------------------------------------

The kitchen was quiet, lit only by the soft glow from under the cabinets and the flicker of a candle burning low on the table. The bottle of red between them was nearly empty. Two glasses. Her bare feet curled on the chair. His long legs stretched out, one sock half off.

It was late, and it should've been perfect.

Tasha laughed softly at something he said, one of those low, easy chuckles she'd mastered over years of loving him. But her eyes didn't quite crinkle at the corners the way they used to. And when the moment passed, so did the warmth.

Ben leaned back in his chair. Shirt unbuttoned. Forearms bare. His hair was messy - the kind of mess she loved - and a shadow of stubble was claiming his jaw. He looked so fucking good it almost hurt.

Something ached, because she'd broken the rules.

It wasn't the sex. Not really. They both loved the game, the push and pull, the flirt and the fuck. They'd built a life on trust and kink and carefully drawn boundaries. But this time - in the hotel, on that business trip - she'd crossed one.

No permission or preview. No Ben.

He'd told her it was fine. That she looked incredible. That he loved hearing about it afterward. But deep in her gut, Tasha knew the difference between ""fine"" and fine.

Whatever this was it wasn't right.

She watched him sip his wine. His fingers curled around the glass, veins shifting under the skin making his tattoos move as though alive, his wedding band catching the light. The man she'd loved for years. Fucked in every room of their house. Shared everything with.

She wanted to say something, wanted to close the distance. But it was like a thin veil hung between them - transparent, but there.

Ben stood first, yawning, scratching the back of his neck.

""I'm heading up,"" he said. ""You staying?""

""For a bit.""

He nodded. Kissed the top of her head. Just a light brush.

She closed her eyes.

She sat in the quiet for a while longer, tracing the lip of her wine glass with one finger. Her mind turning in slow, heavy circles.

They'd lived the kind of lifestyle they did - the sex, the swapping, the watching - for years. But it had always been based on a simple set of rules. The biggest of which was all decisions together.

She'd broken that. Carried away in the moment, looking for ways to test him, push him further. She'd fucked up, and she knew it.

Eventually, she padded upstairs. She paused in the doorway to their bedroom.

He was half-undressed already - jeans off, standing in front of the mirror, bare chest and boxer briefs, his broad back turned to her. The muscles in his shoulders shifted as he rubbed moisturiser into his forearms.

She stared. Even now, her body stirred. Her pussy burned just watching him.

God he was beautiful, she thought to herself.

He caught her eye in the mirror.

""You okay?"" he asked.

Tasha smiled. The kind you wear when you're trying to mean it but struggling to make it believable.

""Yeah. Just tired.""

Ben nodded. He didn't push.

He climbed into bed, and flicked off the lamp on his side. She could hear his breathing shift. The rustle of sheets as he turned toward the wall.

She undressed slowly. Slipped beneath the duvet, staring at the ceiling.

Her body was warm and restless. She reached down and touched herself absently, fingertips grazing her clit. No real intention. Just needing to feel something.

But it didn't take, not without him. They'd had sex since then, but something had been missing. Not a lot, but enough for it to feel different. Somehow incomplete.

Tasha lay there in the dark, eyes wide open, heartbeat steady but hurting.

She had to make this right. But she didn't want to talk about it. She wanted to show him.

***

The following morning the sun bled in slow through the blinds, warm and pale, catching on the edge of the bedding. Tasha woke before him - which itself was rare - and lay still for a minute, listening to Ben breathe.

His arm was flung over his pillow. His mouth slightly open. Hair still messy from sleep. The covers half off, revealing a bare hip and the start of that thick morning bulge pressing into the duvet.

He looked peaceful. Untouched by the thoughts that had churned through her all night.

She reached over and gently touched his forearm. Just enough to feel him. Then she slipped out of bed.

They moved around each other in the kitchen like a couple who knew the routine - coffee, toast, the clink of mugs.

It was familiar and comfortable. But it was not quite them.

Tasha leaned against the counter in her robe, cradling her coffee, watching Ben skim his phone at the table.

She hesitated. Then cleared her throat.

""I was thinking about going out tonight,"" she said, casually as she could. ""Jess and Elle are maybe doing that trance night at Thirty9.""

Ben looked up. ""Yeah?""

""Yeah.""

She didn't say ""are you okay with that?"" - but it was written all over her face.

Ben's expression didn't shift much. Just a faint, neutral nod.

""It's cool. You've not been out in a while.""

""You sure you're ok with it?""

He looked at her properly now, holding her gaze.

""Tash...it's fine. Go. Have fun.""

She gave a small smile. Not because she fully believed him, but because she wanted to.

""Okay,"" she said softly. ""I might wear something sexy. Something for you to think about while I'm out and look forward to when I get back.""

Ben smirked. ""I'd expect nothing less.""

He went back to his phone, while Tasha went back to pretending that everything was just fine.

***

The club was busy, loud and hot. People intoxicated on the alcohol and the music, dancing like they were barely in control.

Low light bathed the place, all red and violet pulses - like being inside a heartbeat. The bass hit deep, thudding through the floor like a second pulse in her chest. Synth arpeggios danced overhead, hypnotic and ghostlike.

Tasha stood near the bar, one elbow resting casually, her other hand curled around a bottle of something colourful and sweet but packing a potent punch. She wasn't in the throngs of the crowd, not yet, though her friends were. She was watching it all, letting the night wash over. She'd come to lose herself, to feel herself again.

To feel alive.

A black leather mini skirt clung tight around her hips, the hem cut sharp across her thighs. Knee-high stiletto boots, patent and textured, caught the flashes of light like wet glass. She wore a red turtleneck that was bold and body-hugging. Partly demure, showing no cleavage, but leaving little to the imagination with the way it cupped her tits in a way that dared attention.

It received it - in waves.

Men turned. Girls glanced.

Eyes flickered, trailed, then looked away too slowly.

She sipped her drink and let them look.

Tasha was in her early forties, but walked with the heat and confidence of a woman who'd only gotten better - and filthier - with age. Tall, toned, and curvy in all the right ways, her figure turned heads without ever begging for attention. Her tits were huge, natural, and proudly unhidden beneath that tight red top - a body that made people stare and wonder if they could handle her.

Most couldn't.

Her hair was dark and long, worn loose over her shoulders with just enough wave to look like it had been styled to fall out of place. Ink curled along one thigh, peeking from under her skirt - and there were others, glimpsed at her wrist, another unseen on her back. She had only one piercing - her right nipple, a bar that made her shirts stretch tighter than they already did.

She was sex, unapologised for.

But tonight, she was on her best behaviour.

It was maybe a good 10 minutes later, as the track shifted - something with a heavier beat and a dirtier rhythm - that the girl appeared beside her.

Not dramatically. She just slid into the space at the bar, close enough to touch, and leaned over slightly to try to catch the bartender's attention.

Tasha noticed her first as movement. Then shape.

She was petite, toned and with bare legs. A denim micro skirt sat low on her hips, frayed at the hem. Her white vest top clung to her chest - no bra, nipples just visible under fabric.

""You waiting too?"" the girl asked, glancing at her sideways. Her voice was soft, but raised slightly to be heard.

Tasha looked at her fully for the first time.

Big brown eyes. Flushed cheeks. Full lips. She was pretty in a slightly unconventional sort of way, and looked like she could only just be legally old enough to be in a place like this. Light brown hair fell around her shoulders.

""Apparently,"" Tasha said, nodding toward the bartender still busy pouring mixers at the far end.

The girl gave a sheepish smile. ""I always pick the wrong place to stand. Or I'm invisible.""

Tasha arched an eyebrow, smiling slightly. ""You're definitely not invisible.""

That made her laugh - a breathy, relieved sound. She brushed hair from her face and bit her lip.

""I like your outfit,"" she said, a moment later. ""You look..."" She trailed off, as if searching for the right word. ""...hot.""

Tasha's smile deepened, something sly and just short of indulgent. She enjoyed the compliment.

""Thanks. You're not doing so bad yourself.""

The bartender finally made his way over. The girl ordered a bottle of a vodka-based drink.

""Are you here with anyone?"" the girl asked, casually, taking her drink.

""Sort of,"" Tasha said. ""Here with a couple of friends. But they're off dancing and probably on the pull. How 'bout you?""

""Alone,"" the girl said, taking a swig from her bottle. She licked a little moisture from her lower lip.

""I'm Chloe, by the way,"" she said now. ""Sorry. Should've said.""

""Tasha.""

The names hung between them. Another wave of bass rolled through the club.

""You come here often?"" Chloe asked, lips twitching at her own cliché.

Tasha laughed softly. ""Not really. Not lately. Just...needed a night.""

""Same.""

She paused, swirling her drink in its bottle.

""My ex used to hate places like this. Said it was full of desperate people trying to fuck strangers.""

""And now?"" Tasha asked.

Chloe shrugged. ""Now I kind of wish I'd fucked a few strangers.""

Tasha let the words settle for a moment. Chloe had said them lightly, offhand almost - but they had carried something behind them. A flicker of heat, or maybe a flicker of hurt.

She turned slightly, facing her more directly now. One boot angled across the floor between them, her own drink still in hand.

""Sounds like there's a story there.""

Chloe smiled into her drink. ""Isn't there always?""

Tasha didn't answer. Just waited.

Chloe exhaled softly. Not dramatic, just letting go.

""We were together six years,"" she said. ""Since school. He was my first. My only.""

Tasha's brow lifted slightly.

Chloe caught the look and grinned.

""I know. Fucking tragic, right? Nearly 22 and only been with one bloke.""

""It's not tragic,"" Tasha said. ""It's just...limited.""

That made Chloe laugh. ""Exactly.""

She took another sip, then leaned back against the bar beside Tasha, shoulders just brushing.

""I thought I knew him. I thought I was doing everything right. We didn't argue. We fucked often enough. We planned things. And then he tells me he's been screwing some older woman. Like, a proper grown woman. Mortgage, job, the works.""

Chloe laughed again, but there was a bitter edge to it. ""Guess she showed him what real sex was like.""

Tasha tilted her ""Did she?""

Chloe looked over, eyes sparking now. ""You tell me. You ever steal someone's man?""

Tasha gave a slightly rueful smile. ""No. But I've borrowed a few.""

That made Chloe go quiet for a second. Tasha let the silence hold.

Then Chloe looked up. ""You married, yeah?""

""I am.""

""But here without him.""

Tasha nodded. ""He knows where I am.""

""So you're allowed to...borrow people?""

""Sometimes. If the mood's right. If the rules are respected.""

Chloe leaned in a little, her voice lower now.

""What kind of rules?""

Tasha took a slow sip of her own drink, watching her over the rim of the bottle.

""Talk first. No surprises. Always protection.""

Chloe's lips parted slightly. Her breath caught, not dramatic, just a hitch.

""And he's cool with that?""

""He is. He gets to join in,"" Tasha said. ""Or watch. Though that's partly why I'm here alone. I broke one of our rules and I think he's still pissed at me.""

Chloe looked stunned for a moment - wide-eyed and flushed.

""That's so fucking hot,"" she murmured. ""Which rule did you break?""

Tasha's smile turned knowing and slightly sad. ""I took a game too far, didn't ask permission before I fucked someone.""

Chloe looked stunned.

""I'm guessing your ex wasn't built for that kind of arrangement,"" said Tasha - a statement rather than a question.

Chloe laughed nervously. ""Please. The sex was so vanilla it barely qualified. He had an average cock and an ego way too big for it.""

Tasha laughed. ""Met plenty of them in my time,"" she said. ""I'm just better at sniffing them out now and avoiding them.

She paused momentarily, then continued. ""I'm very lucky, or I was, still am if I can put it back together. Ben's a diamond and we both love being adventurous. It's how we met, sort of, and it's always been our thing.""

Tasha reached in her clutch bag for her phone, saying nothing at first. She just gave the faintest smile - the kind that curled at the corner of her mouth and hinted at all the things she wasn't saying.

Then unlocked her phone and started to scroll.

Chloe leaned in slightly, instinctively, not too close or invasive. Just...drawn.

The first image:

Ben in jeans and a grey shirt, sleeves pushed up, leaning against their kitchen counter with a glass of wine and a faint smile. Candid and handsome. The kind of man people noticed.

""That's him?"" Chloe asked.

Tasha nodded. ""That's him.""

Swipe.

Ben again - shirtless now. Gym mirror, towel over one shoulder. Sweat on his chest, muscles lit in natural light, abs tight.

Chloe's eyes widened slightly. ""Wow. Okay....""

Swipe.

Ben on the sofa. Casual. Boxers low on his hips. Thick thighs spread, hand resting just above his crotch. The outline of his cock visible - even soft, it looked heavy. Substantial.

""Oh my god,"" Chloe whispered, swallowing hard.

Tasha glanced at her, amused. ""Oops, sorry,"" she said. ""I didn't realise that one was next. Too much?""

Chloe shook her head quickly, her cheeks flushed.

""No. Not too much. He's...that's soft?""

""Mm-hm.""

""Jesus. He's bigger than my ex was hard.""

Tasha laughed. ""Yeah, he's pretty fucking big.""

Chloe didn't hesitate. ""Show me.""

Tasha paused for a moment - not for effect, but to consider. Then she scrolled again, showing Chloe another photo.

Ben hard this time. Thick, veined and very long.

His cock curving up from his groin, his hand wrapped around the base, the head flushed dark and proud. One of those angles that made your breath catch.

Chloe blinked. Her mouth opened slightly, then closed again like she'd forgotten how to speak.

""Fucking hell,"" she breathed, finally.

She took a small step back, like the image had pushed into her chest.

""That's...wow. He's huge.""

Chloe was still staring. Her eyes flicked up, half-guilty. ""Sorry, that's just...fuck. I think my pussy literally just twitched.""

Tasha sipped her drink and laughed.

""He knows how to use it, too.""

Chloe didn't say anything at first.

She just stood there, lips parted, staring down at the image like it had rewired something in her. One hand still loosely holding her drink, the other now resting on the edge of the bar, knuckles white.

Tasha watched her. She didn't press, just let the silence stretch.

Eventually, Chloe exhaled.

""Fuck me,"" she whispered.

Then, quickly, ""Sorry. I didn't mean to say that out loud.""

Tasha raised one eyebrow, the curve of another smile ghosting her mouth.

""You alright?""

""I just..."" Chloe swallowed. ""I've never seen anything like that. Not...not in real life. Not attached to someone real.""

She took another sip of her drink - a little too fast. Her cheeks were flushed now, her eyes glassier, her voice lower.

""He's...."" she tried again. ""He's beautiful. You both are.""

Tasha inclined her head slightly. Accepted the compliment like a queen accepts an offering.

""And he's a real man,"" Chloe added. ""Not like the boy I was with. I've never had anything like that - what's it like to fuck a cock like that?""

Tasha smiled. ""Incredible,"" she said, truthfully.

Tasha didn't say anything else. Instead she let Chloe reach for it herself - which she did.

""I should probably fuck an older guy with a big cock like that,"" Chloe said, almost laughing at her own words. ""Just...for the experience. If my prick of an ex could, why shouldn't I?""

Tasha turned to her fully now. Her body facing Chloe's, her drink resting on the bar behind her.

""Maybe you should.""

Chloe met her eyes.

Tasha leaned in, just enough that Chloe could feel the heat of her breath.

""Maybe,"" Tasha murmured, ""I've got one at home, waiting for you.""

Chloe didn't speak, but she didn't step back either.

Her chest rose slightly. She didn't speak, but Tasha could see the thought forming behind her eyes: yes.

Tasha didn't press the moment. She let the silence settle, then she turned back toward the bar, picked up her bottle, and took a slow sip.

Chloe blinked, cheeks pink, her gaze flicking between Tasha's profile and her phone screen, dark now but with the image of Ben's cock ingrained in her mind.

She reached for her own drink and took a long pull.

When she spoke again, her voice was steadier.

""You always this direct?"" she asked, playful now. Breathless but recovering.

Tasha smirked. ""Only when I know it'll land. And I owe him something.""

Chloe laughed softly - and this time, it wasn't nervous. It was electric.

They stood like that for a few moments, shoulder to shoulder, hips angled in, the club still vibrating around them. Lights strobed as the DJ shifted into a remix that thudded harder. Bodies writhed out on the floor like liquid silhouettes.

Tasha turned her head slightly. ""You okay?""

Chloe nodded. ""Yeah. Just...processing.""

""You want to talk yourself in to it, or out of it?"" Tasha asked.

Chloe looked at her, held her gaze steady. ""I'm trying to think of reasons to say no,"" she said. ""But the truth is, I don't want to say no.""

""Sure?""

Chloe's tongue darted across her bottom lip. She stepped half a pace closer, her voice softer, more intimate.

""I'm horny. I'm curious. And I'm definitely not going home to finger myself and regret not going with you.""

Tasha grinned, looking pleased.

Chloe exhaled. ""Fuck it. I'm in.""

Tasha lifted her bottle, tapping it lightly against Chloe's. ""To experience, then.""

Chloe smiled. ""To older men with massive cocks.""

Tasha laughed. ""And the women who bring them.""

They downed the last of their drinks in sync, set them down, and turned toward the door.

***

The taxi smelled like cheap pine air freshener. It wasn't unpleasant, just the kind of smell you didn't notice until you did, and then couldn't shake it off.

Tasha slid in first, Chloe close behind. The door shut. The city blurred past. Bass still throbbed faintly in their ears from the club. Streetlights rolled over their bodies in flickers of gold and shadow.

Tasha's legs parted slightly as she settled back. Her skirt rode high on her thighs, leather creaking softly. Chloe's bare skin brushed against her, knees touching.",,2025-08-15T19:17:20.788932,3415,

CHAPTER 30: ""The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself""

* * *

Ethan slowly felt sleep leave his brain and smiled. He was finally back on the Argo with his wives where they all belonged. Somewhere deep down, he felt some irritation that Kendra wasn't right next to him though. He didn't understand why, nor why it aggravated him so much. The only thing he could think of was how his dragon side had seethed at her absence last night. The dragon wanted to drag her in here and force her to have sex with him via compulsion.

He pushed the thought away and focused on his surroundings, enjoying the simple pleasure of feeling his wives' naked skin....

Wait.

As he lay there with his eye closed, he realized that he was feeling something that he'd basically never felt before. Or at least not in his dragon body when waking up with his wives around him. He was feeling cloth pressed up against him, and it wasn't the sheets either. He cracked an eye open and a massive smile crept onto his face.

In front of him was a mess of red hair that slowly faded to blonde at the tips. Her blue eyes were hidden by delicate eyelids topped with long lashes, and her mouth was formed into the barest hint of a smile. Her breathing was slow, contented, and peaceful. She looked a vision of loveliness; a redheaded angel who was among the most delightful women he'd ever met.

He took a deep breath and let it out through his smiling lips. He was really going to enjoy having Rachel as his wife.

*Good morning sir.* Alana's mental voice said directly to him, probably so she wouldn't wake his other wives.

He had never heard her so happy.

He lifted his head to see that the wood elf was cradled in Rachel's arms and had a magnificent smile on her face; a massive smile that was would also be appropriate for a post-orgasmic haze.

*Morning princess.* He said with a wink, then added in a mischievous tone: *Whatever could be making you so happy this morning?*

She sighed. *I thought this day would never come; I've dreamed of it for so long.*

He chuckled, shaking the three of them slightly, then reached up and tucked a wayward lock of the redhead's hair behind her small ears. She had beautiful ears; very shapely and delicate.

""Hmm?"" Rachel muttered in her sleep, though she seemed to be waking.

""Good morning beautiful."" He whispered into her ear.

""Goo' morn' 'gly."" She mumbled.

He chuckled again. ""What brings you here?""

""Hmm?"" She mumbled as she started to do that waking-yawning-stretching thing some people do when they wake up.

""Good morning Rachel."" Alana said softly.

The redhead smiled contentedly. ""Good morning Alana..."" Her eyes flew open and she sat bolt upright, looking around wildly. ""Wha...? How...?""

Ethan and Alana laughed, and the sound woke his other two wives. Beth and Taloni started yawning sleepily while Rachel looked completely shocked and out of sorts.

""How did I...?"" She looked around, then looked down and sighed -- probably in relief -- when she saw she was still wearing her red dress. The lower portion of her dress had ridden up a bit in her sleep, exposing the lower half of two very slender and shapely thighs.

""I'm guessing you sleepwalked."" Ethan said between chuckles.

""Rachel!"" Taloni and Beth exclaimed at the same time. His two youngest wives dove forward, hugging her from both sides.

""I'm so glad you're here!"" Beth said beaming.

""I knew you'd make it!"" Taloni said with an equally exuberant expression.

Rachel glanced at the two of them, then Alana -- all three of whom were completely naked -- and then she went beet red and looked up at the ceiling, snapping her eyes shut as she did so.

""Ladies, you might want to cover up a bit; I think you're making Rachel a bit uncomfortable."" He said when he noticed the likely reason for her embracement.

The two blondes disengaged and all three of his wives pulled the sheets up.

""Thank you."" Rachel said as her face returned to a more normal color, resembling her hair tips more than the roots. She looked around and averted her eyes a bit. ""Sorry.""

""For what?"" He asked.

""Um, for..."" She looked around at the bed, then at him.

He reached up and took both her hands. She didn't resist his gentle pull as he raised them up. ""Rachel, let me be perfectly clear; you

never

need to apologize for being in bed with me. Ever. Understand?""

She nodded, still looking sheepish but also smiling.

""Now, as much as I love having you here, you should probably get going..."" He cocked his head to one side. ""...or maybe I should; anyway, it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride on the wedding day before the ceremony.""

All the girls stared opened-mouthed at him.

""What?"" He asked.

""Bad luck to see the bride..."" Alana stared at him mouth agape.

""...on the wedding day before the ceremony?"" Rachel finished looking equally thunderstruck.

""Well that explains it; I've been wondering for ages."" Beth nodded.

""Yes, it makes so much more sense now."" Taloni added.

""What does?"" He looked around at them, feeling like he was completely missing something.

""If the groom doesn't see the bride on the wedding day before the ceremony starts, the marriage is doomed to failure; everyone knows that."" Alana said like she was explaining that two plus two equals four.

""If that never happens on your world, no wonder they have such a high divorce rate."" Rachel said in much the same manner as a person who'd just realized that water was wet and deserts were dry.

He burst out laughing.

The girls all stared at him.

""Culture shock."" He finally said when he'd stopped laughing. ""Why is a marriage doomed if they don't meet before the wedding?""

Alana opened her mouth to respond, then closed it and cocked her head to one side. ""I don't know.""

""It's an old custom."" Beth explained. ""From back when the couple would often meet on the wedding day. It gave the groom a chance to inspect the bride and make sure he wanted to marry her.""

""And they often pray together so Illuminar will bless their marriage."" Taloni added.

Beth gasped aloud. ""Ethan, you never told us about your meeting with Illuminar!""

""You didn't?"" Rachel asked looking very surprised.

He shook his head. ""I was waiting until I could tell all of you together... including you.""

""Aww."" Rachel teared up slightly.

""Come here."" He said opening his arms, which she fell into.

""...but what happened with Illuminar?"" Beth prompted impatiently.

He glanced at her, the blonde's boundless curiosity getting the better of her as usual. She was so cute when she was curious, especially with the way her 'curious face' made her dimples stood out.

He smiled at her. ""Maybe not the time angel; it is Rachel's wedding day.""

She nodded, averting her eyes as she did so. ""I'm sorry Dominus.""

""No need to be sorry."" He replied kindly. ""I'm just saying that I don't need to explain now.""

""Actually, I'd like it if you did."" The redhead said.

""Oh?"" He let go of her slightly to look into her beautiful blue eyes.

""I'm really curious about what happened and..."" She paused a second, seemingly searching for more reasons. ""...and I'll be better able to concentrate on the wedding if I know.""

He raised an eyebrow.

""Please?"" His teenaged bride-to-be asked.

""Okay."" He nodded, thinking that there was probably more too it, but not wanting to push right now. Fortunately, his stomach rumbled moments later. ""But let's make it after breakfast.""

* * *

""I can take that bowl if you're done."" Sarah said pleasantly when she saw that one of the inn's customers had finished his breakfast.

The man mumbled a word of thanks and held it out to her. He was one of the two types of patrons that she really liked. The first type was like him, who were polite and minded their own business. The second type were like Selene, and they were all too rare. They were the pleasant ones who treated her nicely and were kind to her. She wished they had more of them. Sadly, many of the people who came through seemed nervous and unsure about her. She was pretty sure it was because word of her problem had spread far and wide over the years.

She let her shoulders slump as she went to the next table, where a young woman was sitting. She was clad in a white linen dress and something about her seemed to glow slightly. Her heart shaped face was the picture of perfect femininity, and something about her just seemed warm and relaxing; like a flickering candle shining in a dark room.

""Oh, thank you."" The woman in white said when Sarah collected her now empty bowl, which she had already pushed away from herself. She had treated Sarah perfectly and not given her so much as a suspicious look.

""You're welcome."" Sarah replied with as much sweetness as she could muster.

""Are you okay?"" The luminous woman asked. Her voice had a comforting, almost musical quality about it.

I'm... I've been better."" She admitted.

The woman pulled a chair out so Sarah could sit next to her. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

The innkeeper's daughter hesitated a moment, and then shook her head. ""I have chores to do.""

""Okay."" The woman in the white dress replied kindly. ""Well, I hope things get better for you.""

""Thank you."" She smiled, her dark mood lifting slightly at the other woman's kindness. She added the luminous woman's empty bowl to the other one she was carrying and took them into the kitchen. She started humming a Hymn to Illuminar as she washed them to try and cheer herself up. She wasn't sure why, but that usually seemed to cheer her up.

The singing eventually morphed into a prayer. ""Illuminar -- blessed be you -- thank you for sending Selene here. Please keep her safe and, if it's not too much trouble, I would really like it if she could come back for my wedding. I know you're busy with more important things, but I would really like her to be there when I marry Rindrin.""

She looked at the bowls as she set them down to dry, trying not to think of her wedding day.

Rindrin wasn't a bad guy, and Sarah was grateful that he was willing to marry her. She had no ill feelings for him, but wasn't attracted to him either. She would try to be the best wife she could of course, but wished it would be with a man she loved. At least she would be married though; she had thought her problem would prevent that for the longest time.

Fortunately, it wasn't likely that her problem would manifest if she was at home being a housewife. She wanted to venture out into the world and see what it offered, but that wasn't a good idea with her problem. She didn't want to hurt anyone else because of it; she'd hurt too many people already. At least being at home, and maybe being a mother, nothing bad would happen. She smiled, and thought about that for several moments.

She was shaken from her reverie by movement outside the window.

Hmm.

That was odd.

At least dozen horses were cantering into the little outpost and her eyes went wide at the unusual sight. She ran to the back door and opened it to get a better view. It was indeed over a dozen horsemen riding in close formation. All were clad from head to toe in chainmail, and each had a conical helmet to add further protection to his head. Each had an arming sword at his side, some had seven-foot short spears, and all of them also carried a heater shield.

In the center of the formation was the only man not clad in chainmail. Instead, he was wearing the finest robes that Sarah had ever seen. She wasn't sure, but guessed that they probably cost more than what the inn made in a year. He had a sword at his side also and the hilt had a large gemstone embedded in it that was probably worth enough to buy the outpost and everything in it.

She wondered who he was for a moment...

That's when she noticed the banners.

The lead horseman and the trailing horseman each had a handheld flagpole affixed to his saddle and held steady by one of the rider's hands. The flag had a green background with a stylized white mountain in the center. That was the flag of...

Her mouth fell open as her stomach clenched.

She could feel the color draining from her face

What was he doing here?

She turned and fled back inside, running to find her father. He needed to know. Neither of them had ever met the man before, but it couldn't be a good sign that he was here.

""Father!"" She called loudly as she entered the main room of the inn, startling some of the guests.

""What?"" He said in his usual defeated tone.

""Father, soldiers are riding into the outpost; it's Lord Farbrottan and his men!""

Everyone in the room froze.

No one moved for several seconds as everyone's eyes went wide.

Then there was a mad scramble. Everyone stood up at once, leaving everything behind and starting for the door. They all stopped when they heard the horses thundering to it and saw them come to a stop through the front windows. All the patrons turned as one towards the back door, but -- judging by the whinnying of horses -- that too appeared to be covered by the soldiers.

It appeared the inn had been surrounded.

The various travelers seemed unsure what to do, and then all of them fled to the communal sleeping area; retreating as far away as possible away from the new arrivals.

Sarah took a deep breath and let it out slowly.

She had to keep calm. That was the only thing that would do. If she got too scared then... she didn't even want to think about the trouble that her problem would cause. Unfortunately, her present situation was going to make that incredibly difficult.

She gulped as the inn's door started to open.

* * *

Ethan swallowed down the last bite of breakfast and washed it down with swig of water. The entire crew of the Argo was sitting around the fire, plus Selene and Kendra. Anthiel, Serif, and Raklan were fairly quiet this morning, though the latter occasionally let out a loud belch. Rachel was on Ethan's right side with Alana next to her; and Beth on his left side with Taloni next to her. The Fey teen was also sitting next to Kendra, who still looked wary and a bit uncomfortable.

Sandwiched in between Kendra and Anthiel was Selene, the FBI agent who'd caused so much trouble for them on Earth. He couldn't help but be curious about what she was doing here. She was clearly sharp and perceptive, but for her to be here in the Ten Kingdoms...

Hmm.

It was definitely odd.

The woman was gorgeous; drop dead gorgeous and she had wearing a very plain, light grey dress, no makeup, and her silky, caramel-colored hair wasn't styled either. Just as she was, she could easily do well in a modeling competition. She was an inch or two taller than he was in normal posture at maybe 5' 9"", but thanks to his Dragon anatomy he could easily stand up taller and still have an inch or two on her.

She was slender without being too thin; her breasts were full without being too large; her legs were long, slender and toned; and she had a perfect hourglass figure. She had the classic look of a Brazilian supermodel with just a hint of oriental ancestry; Japanese maybe. The combination made her look very exotic in addition to being jaw-droppingly beautiful.

He found himself wondering why a woman who was that attractive had decided to become an FBI agent. With her looks and smarts, she could've done almost anything. It was interesting that the FBI was her chosen profession in light of that.

*She is beautiful, isn't she.* Alana thought to them all.

*She is.* Taloni said wistfully.

*I wish I had her... well, her everything.* Beth added.

All three sounded a bit dejected.

*Ladies, I'm not blind and she is gorgeous; but no one is more attractive to me than you girls.*

They all sighed as one.

Rachel, Kendra and Selene all looked at them.

""It takes some getting used to."" Anthiel explained with a smile. ""He can talk to them telepathically and sometimes they talk amongst themselves in public, and then react without us knowing what was said.""

""What's that like?"" Selene asked.

""Amazing."" Alana said at the same time that Kendra said ""Annoying.""

Almost everyone laughed. Even the corners of Kendra's mouth twitched up a bit.

""So, Agent Dawson,"" Ethan began, intending to ask about her story.

""Not agent anymore."" She replied with a hint of bitterness in her voice.

""Oh?""

""Things got rough for me right after you left Earth."" She shook her head with an ironic smile. ""I never thought I'd say a sentence like that before... what? Three weeks ago? That's about when I saw you leave Earth right?""

""About that."" He nodded.

""Twenty two days."" Rachel confirmed.

Selene shook her head in disbelief. ""It's still so weird.""

""It does get easier."" He offered.

""I hope so.""

""So

Miss

Dawson, how'd you end up in the Ten Kingdoms?"" He asked.

""It's a long story, and I wouldn't want to interrupt the pending nuptials."" She nodded towards Rachel, then frowned. ""Isn't it bad luck to see the bride on her wedding day?""

Ethan and his wives laughed, and then they explained about the different custom here in the Ten Kingdoms.

""Huh, weird."" The Brazilian woman shrugged when they finished.

""I know, right?"" Ethan nodded.

""Um, I don't mind if you tell the story."" Rachel said to Selene. ""I'm rather curious myself and we have plenty of time.""

He looked at the redhead, but she didn't meet his eye.

Hmm.

Was she stalling on purpose? She certainly seemed ecstatic about being bonded to him, so it wasn't that. The only thing that he could think of was the issue she'd brought up before, about how their relationship would work since she didn't want anyone telling her what to do. That was probably what it was; she was probably stalling so she didn't have to deal with that.

He was shaken from his reverie by the Brazilian woman though.

""While we're on the topic of stories."" Selene interjected. ""I'd love to hear how you started a human on Earth, came here, apparently became a dragon, disguised yourself as a human, and then went back to Earth; especially how you got back to Earth.""

""You want to go back?"" Beth asked.

""Definitely.""

""Serif, Raklan."" Anthiel said. ""We're going to have a crew meeting downstairs.""

""What? Why?"" Raklan rumbled. ""I'm comfortable right here."" He said while his eyes flicked to Selene's body.

""Now."" Anthiel said firmly.

The hulking crewman scowled. ""But we've never had a--""

Serif cleared his throat.

The larger crewman started grumbling under his breath and then stood up.

""But Anthiel, what about the Argo?"" Taloni asked. ""Doesn't someone need to mind the helm?""

""Yes."" The high elf looked pointedly at the Fey. ""And fortunately she's becoming a proficient airship pilot who is more than capable of checking our heading every half hour.""

Taloni gulped as her wings fluttered nervously.

""You'll do fine honey; you can handle it."" Ethan assured her.

Tee still looked nervous, but she nodded. Anthiel, Serif, and Raklan all went below decks, leaving Ethan, Alana, Beth, Taloni, Rachel, Kendra, and Selene sitting on the around the coals that remained from breakfast fire. Ethan couldn't help but think that he was surrounded by beautiful women, and enjoyed the feeling very much.

Even Kendra -- who probably had never taken any pains on her appearance -- had a 'girl-next-door' kind of beauty that was subtle, but seemed to grow over time. Her jet black hair wasn't tied back this morning, and it fell in thick waves down just past her shoulders. Her eyes were deep brown, if a bit mistrustful. She had a vaguely Latina look about her, though perhaps with hint of Mediterranean that complimented it. Her skin looked heavily tanned, but healthy nevertheless.",,2025-08-15T19:17:28.330064,3496,
https://www.literotica.com/s/motherly-lust-the-book-of-evil-ch-05,"Motherly Lust, The Book of Evil Ch. 05",Unknown Author,,,,,"Leading me by the hand, mom pulled me back into the bedroom. As we stepped through the door, she sank to her knees and yanked my pants down to my ankles.

She put her nose to my length and inhaled deeply, her eyes hooding over in ecstasy. Savoring our combined scents, she planted a series of feverish kisses and licks up and down my head and shaft. Moving on to my balls, she repeated the process, growling animalistically as she inhaled, before assaulting them with a barrage of furious kisses. Her tongue danced up and down my sack, slurping and purring as she worshiped me. Pulling back, she took me into her mouth. Swallowing me whole and momentarily deep throating me, she stopped and jumped up onto the bed.

""So... wanna fuck?"" She giggled, opening her legs and spreading her lips apart with two fingers.

""Maybe,"" I offered back, kicking my pants off and removing my shirt.

""Then get over here and give me what your wife cheated me out of""

---

6:12 PM, one hour from Tracey's departure

""Mmmm.... Fuck. You feel so good.""

""Cum in me, I want it so bad......... ohhhh fuuuuuuuck! Ye- Yes! YES! I want it all.""

""Fucking shit Mom... we should clean up and get ready to go now.""

""Okay baby, let me jump in the shower.""

Bracing her arms against the bed, Mom rose from her place on my lap. Slipping off of me with a shiver, she leaned over and gave me a peck on the lips.

""Sooooo,"" she said, propping herself up on my chest, ""How badly do you think we messed up?""

""What exactly do you mean?"" I asked, absentmindedly trailing my hand up her bare back.

""What I mean is, we weren't supposed to

touch

each other today, let alone... all of this... you know."" She finished with a vague gesture towards our naked bodies.

""You mean..."" I paused, painfully aware of my dick's close proximity to her entrance, ""all of this?"" I finished, reaching down and gently teasing her lips with my head.

""James... down, boy,"" she murmured through gritted teeth.

""What?"" I asked innocently, slowly penetrating her with my entire length until once again fully engulfed within her warmth.

Resting the rest of her weight on my torso, she placed a hand on either cheek and graced me with yet another peck on the lips as my hands found her supple ass and gave a firm squeeze.

""You

know

what baby. We're supposed to be cleaning up, remember?""

She kissed my lips yet again, and again, and again as I lightly pushed against her, pressing our waists together, desperate for the closeness as the pecking grew more and more reckless.

We kissed and kissed and kissed, light, affectionate pecks on the lips, until I felt her tongue brush up against my lower lip. Opening my mouth, she dashed in, softly grazing my tongue with her own. We danced together, teasing, pecking, biting. Gradually, our kissing grew more fervent, desperate. She opened her mouth and pushed a torrent of hot saliva into my own. Lapping it up greedily, I swallowed before moving in to receive her tongue once again. Our hips beginning to gyrate as any concerns we'd had melted away.

""I remember,"" I said, starting a gentle rhythm in and out of her sex as I nudged her head to the side to plant a barrage of kiss and licks up and down her neck, ""We're sick, remember?""

""Obviously..."" she murmured under her breath, withdrawing a hand from my face she pulled her hair to the side, granting me better access and slowly bouncing up and down on my cock.

""We're so bad..."" she whispered, pausing momentarily before looking back down at me and lunging in for a messy kiss, aggressively riding me as we went for the fifth round in a single day.

----

7:46, two hours and thirty four minutes from Tracey's departure.

""God... FUCK! I can't believe we're doing this a- a- ah! Agaaaiiiin!!!""

""Ughhh, I'm cumming.""

""Mmmm I feel it, give it to m- meeeeeee!""

----

7:50, two hours and thirty eight minutes from Tracey's departure

""So...."" Mom said, lying down next to me on the bed panting as we came down from our last high, ""Is cumming seven times in one day a normal thing for you?""

""Absolutely not, not without feeling like my dick is gonna fall off at least... if it'd even be possible."" I shrugged, absentmindedly poking and prodding my hard on which had yet to fully go down.

""Does it feel like it's about to fall off right now?"" She asked, placing a hand on it and kissing me on the cheek.

""No... it's weird.""

""Yeah, weird,"" she agreed, ""and a little scary, don't ya think?""

""Yeah..."" I said, scooting in closer to her and wrapping an arm around her shoulder, ""This is the book...""

""I figured as much,"" she said, resting her head on my chest and looking up at me.

""Mom...""

""Baby?""

""You're jerking me off again.""

""I know.""

""Shouldn't we be cleaning up right now, so you can take me home?""

""Probably.""

""Soooo... let's get to it then?""

""Do you want to sweetie?""

""No.""

""Neither do I.""

""Soooo...""

""Ohhhh.... Yesssss...""

""Mmm, fuck, Mom, you feel so good.""

""I love you so much baby. Ughhh- mmm- ah! Fuck me harder.""

----

8:23, three hours and eleven minutes from Tracey's departure.

""Mmmmm!!!! FUCK! Cum for me baby, GIVE IT TO ME!"" Mom screamed, seizing up as I pounded into her from behind.

Grabbing a fistful of her hair, I wrenched her head back and planted myself deep inside of her. Planted into her soaking hole, I forcefully pushed against her as I came, jerking her body forward as she threw her head to the ceiling and howled in ecstasy.

I must have came for a solid minute and a half, my supply of cum seemingly endless as I painted her walls again and again, each spurt sending us into vicious cycles of unrelenting pleasure.

*ring ring*

As our climax petered out, my phone lit up with a picture of my dear wife.

Shushing Mom, I picked it up and placed it to my ear, still inside of her as I answered.

""Hey babe.""

""Hey... you gonna be coming home soon?""

""Yeah,"" I said, flinching as Mom shook her head at me with an evil grin, throwing herself back on sensitive length still buried inside of her, ""ughh, I'm just cleaning up the bathroom right now. I think I might need a shower before I leave.""

""Good, so you're feeling better then?""

""I- I- I'm..."" I trailed off, scared at what would come out of my mouth as I tried to speak, because mom had started to thrust back and forth against me as fast as she could manage, pushing back and forth against the bed frame in front of her. Looking back, she sent a sultry look my way and raised a finger to her lips in a shushing motion.

""James? Are you okay?""

""Yeah... just-"" My sentence remained unfinished as Mom reached back to grab my phone from my hand. Quickly ending the call, she wound up and threw it against the wall.

""I am so fucking tired of that woman!"" She yelled, pulling off of me and turning around so she was eye level with my cock on her hands and knees.

""Always interrupting-""

She paused to pop my dick into her mouth, sucking me up and down as she fondled my balls.

""me and my baby boy-""

She put it back into her mouth, taking me deep into her throat and gagging before sucking the head,

hard,

and removing it with a loud *pop.*

""while we're bonding."" She finished, lazily stroking my cock and looking up at me with a wide eyed look of adoration.

""Mom, stop... She's gonna freak out..."" I groaned as she took me back into her mouth, torturously sucking me up and down.

""Let her,"" she said, getting up and laying back on the bed, ""Now stick your dick in me.""

Unable to resist, I plunged back into her of my own accord, lifting her back with my left arm and pulling her close.

Pounding her with all my might, I said, ""Mom... what if she shows up here?""

""W- wh- why would she do that? Sh- she! doesn't want to get siiiCK! Don't do that if you want me to t- t- TAAAALK! Ohhhh FUUUUUCK!"" She broke off into a series of incoherent moans as I brought a finger down to her clit, ""God damn it James!""

""She might show up,"" I continued, removing my hand and slowing down, ""Because you hung up on her, and I'm here 'sick,' remember? What if she sees us?

""Oh fucking well!"" She yelped as I bottomed out, ""Then you get to stay here wi- with me- baaaby, don't stop.

""You don't mean that,"" I said, pausing my motions and giving her a disapproving look.

""Mean what?"" She said, desperately thrusting her hips into mine, pushing me deeper into her.

""What you just said, that I can just stay here with you. I have a life mom, you have a life. What about dad? Do you really want that?"" I asked, pulling out until only my head remained inside of her.

""I don't know what I want, I'm just talking. Now please James....""

""What?"" I asked, eyeing her soiled body.

""You

know

what."" She said, attempting to pull me back inside of her, thwarted by me holding back.

""I want to hear you say it..."" I murmured, raising my eyebrows and giving a mock thrust into her.

""Really?"" She wined, wiggling her hips with a pout.

""Really,"" I said, pulling out entirely as I walked towards the wall to grab my phone from the floor, relieved to see it wasn't broken.

Mom watched me pick it up and walk back over to the bed, resuming my place between her legs and teasing her clit with my tip.

She moaned desperately, giving me a pleading look, ""Please James... my sweet baby boy... come back to me... inside of me... I want..."" she trailed off with a stubborn look.

""You want....?""

""I want you to fuck me. Happy?""

""You want me to fuck who?""

""What do you mean who? I want you to fuck-"" she broke off as realization hit her, her eyes lighting up with excitement as she understood what I wanted.

""Son..."" she crooned, rubbing a hand against my chest, ""Fuck your mommy, please?""

I slipped my head past her lips, groaning as I felt her warmth encompass my most sensitive area.

""Is that what you want, huh?"" She said, caressing my chest and stomach with a devious look on her face, ""Are you getting off knowing it's your mommy's pussy around your dick?""

""Yeah, yeeesss you arrrre- oh!"" She broke off as I pushed myself in another inch, giving her a playful look as her legs locked.

""You like momma's pussy, don't you? Momma's pussy likes you baby... Momma's pussy loves you so much... mmmmm, fuck. Yes baby, deeper. Give it to me..."" she trailed off as I bottomed out, looking up at me expectantly and biting her lip.

""Yes?"" She asked.

""Here,"" I said, handing her my phone, ""Call her and explain that I'm back in the bathroom, stuck on the toilet.""

""And you won't fuck me until I do?"" She asked bitterly, ""that's how it is?""

""No,"" I said, furiously slamming into her for a few seconds before taking up a slow and steady pace, ""No, that's not how it is.""

""Oh..."" she grinned at me with an evil glint in her eyes, ""You're a bad, bad boy."" She finished by pulling me in for a kiss, opening her mouth to accept my tongue and wrapping her legs around my waist. We stood like that for a moment, me struggling to fuck her as fast as my body called for as her legs held my waist in an iron grip, gyrating her hips in time with my increasingly strained thrusting.

As I reached the edge, she pulled my length in tighter, her hips trembling as she locked me in place, cooing at me as she alternated between showering me frantic kisses and decadently breathing me in. Sniffing my neck, chest, and face, she whimpered, looking me in the eyes and urging me on in a light, unnaturally high pitched voice.

""Ooooh, yes baby."" She squealed, squeezing my waist as tightly as she could with her legs, matching my every movement with a deft circular motion of her hips.

""Cum in your momma's pussy,"" she whined, putting a finger to her lower lip and treating me to a small pout just dripping with sex.

""Cum for Mommy baby, oh yes!"" Screwing up her face further, looking as if she were about to cry, yet maintaining the devilish look of sensuality in her every feature. She rocked her hips faster and more aggressively, begging me to blow.

""Please baby, give it to me. Cum for Mommy, ohhhh, cummmm for Mommy,"" she squealed, pulling me in for another sloppy kiss as she felt me spasming inside of her.

Wrapping her arms around my upper back, she managed to tighten the grip her legs had on my waist even tighter as she squeezed me in. Her arms struggled against my elbows locked on either side of her, holding myself upright on the bed as she threw her head back and screamed.

As we peaked, her eyes turned jet black - just like my dream - and my entire body was overcome with an onslaught of beautiful, wonderful pleasure. Slumping onto Mom's chest, she squirted as I came harder than I'd ever thought possible.

Growling into the night, Mom rocked her hips endlessly, milking every last drop out of my dwindling climax. Her skin ran frighteningly hot, and I watched in sick fascination as her brunette hair darkened into a jet black that matched her eyes.

Snapping her face towards my own, she withdrew her legs from around my body, jumped up, and pushed me onto my back. Leaping on top of me, she rushed my sensitive cock back into her cunt, working my length into her again and again.

Her arousal mixed with my cum as it poured down my shaft and pooled onto my waist. She moaned in delight as I bottomed out, rubbing her ass in circles against me and smearing the juices onto her feverish skin.

Reaching back, she grabbed my phone and held it up to my face.

""You want me to call her baby?"" She asked, slowly bouncing up and down, leaning back and giving me a delightful view of her massive tits swaying in time with her movements.

""Ohhh, I'll call her. Just for you, baby boy,"" she moaned, holding the phone up to her ear and leaning forward with her boobs in my face, furiously bouncing her ass up and down on my cock.

The room was filled with the harsh smack of skin on skin each time our bodies connected. The energy frenetic, she moved faster and faster while the phone rang.

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

She picked up on the fifth ring.

As Tracey answered the phone, Mom put her on speaker.

""Hello? James, are you okay? What happened?""

*clap clap clap clap clap*

""Oh, FUCK that's good!"" I grunted.

""James....? Are you there?""

*clap clap clap CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*

""Ohhh! My god!"" Mom moaned.

""What the hell is going on.....? babe?""

*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*

""Ohhh, yes. Mmmmm fuck."" Mom moaned, placing the phone onto the pillow above my head and leaning in for a wet haphazard kiss, our lips loudly smacking together as I eagerly met her mouth, unable to properly process just what she was doing.

*smack* *slurp* *smack* *slurp* *spit*

*clap clap clap clap clap CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*

""Mmmm, YES! Fuck me James. Fuck meeee!"" She squealed as I took a nipple into my mouth and met her every bounce with an aggressive thrust of my own. She froze in place as I fucked her hole without a care in the world, yelling out a stream of obscenities as I went. I felt every care and concern in the world slowly slip away, replaced only with endless... beautiful pleasure... orgasmic bliss.

""Ohhh fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK! Fuck me baby, yessssssss ah huh huhhhhhh!!! Fuck Mommy's pussy. Mommy needs your CUM! FUCK!""

""Oh my god, what the FUCK are you DOING?"" Tracey screamed into the line, her voice tinged with despair and disgust.

""Sorry Trace,"" Mom said, picking up the phone, ""Hubby won't be home tonight. We're a little busy here. Yes baby, just like that. Fuck Mommy's pussy just like that....""

""What the FUCK...? I don't even know what to say. I- How long has this-""

""Shut up,"" Mommy moaned into the receiver, tossing my phone aside and planting herself firmly onto my member.

I saw white as her walls moved independently of the rest of her body, gently massaging my entire length, with special care given to my frenulum.

""Baby..."" Mommy said, leaning down and licking my cheek, ""Cum for me, one more time. Just one more time, then you'll see.""

Bucking my hips, I pushed into her as hard as I could manage, gripping her hips as her cunt quickened it's unnatural onslaught.

""Come one,"" Mommy whined, ""Look me in the eyes baby.""

Making eye contact, I stared into her jet black irises. Seeing nothing but an endless pool of ecstasy within them, my legs locked and my cock jumped for joy.

""Mommy loves you...""

My entire body came alive for what felt like the very first time.

My skin burned in the most delightful way imaginable.

My eyes were alight. I could feel them changing, moving. It was... warm. It felt incredible.

Most importantly perhaps, was the neverending orgasm overtaking my body. Every muscle locked up, my only movement being the involuntary twitching and thrusting of my hips, desperate to feel more of Mommy's sweet cunt as I shot an endless stream of cum deep into her womb. I felt my cock growing, I screamed in

sick

debauched joy as I felt my head bump up against her cervix, earning a wanton snarl from Mommy's lips as she continued to wickedly massage my now massive length with her unholy hole.

It built and built, until...

---

""James....? Wake up baby, we passed out."" She said, gently nudging my shoulder.

Slowly opening my eyes, I looked around the room in confusion. My eyes taking note of the huge stains littered across the carpet and bedsheets, evidence of our recent debauchery before settling on my mother's face.

As I set my eyes on her... my cock stood at attention, throbbing at the sight of what she'd become.

She was gorgeous.

Where the fuck did that book come from?

I thought to myself as I turned to the side and slowly rose to my feet.

""Well...."" A disembodied voice filled the room, ""You succumbed much quicker than most. I must say, it is a little sad that you gave in so easily.""

CHAPTER 27: The road less traveled

* * *

Kendra started feathering her airship's sails to reduce speed as she neared the crowded airspace of the wood elven capital city of Nalatia. Everything in her wanted to turn around, but she needed to warn Ethan -- and more importantly Taloni -- that Lord Delmar almost certainly knew that they were in the city. He would probably make a move by the end of the day and it was already past well past noon. That left the dragon huntress precious little time to find a berth, dock, find the Argo, and warn the crew of the impending danger.

She took a deep breath as she remembered the

other

thing that she needed to do while she was here. While everything in her was united in its desire to save the Fey teen, she was at war with herself on the other thing. She knew she needed to apologize to Ethan, but everything in her was telling her to run; run far away and never see him again, never talk of him again, and maybe never think of him again if she could manage it.

But she couldn't.

Taloni's life might be on the line if Lord Delmar attacked, and she simply couldn't risk that; it didn't matter how little she wanted to see the dragon.

* * *

Ethan felt his mind wanting to freeze as his body wanted to run. He was pretty sure that he was on a mountaintop with an angel and God Himself, after unknowingly telling God that He was both unjust and didn't care. No, it was worse; he'd called God a 'colossal asshole'. He was surprised that he wasn't being struck by a lightning bolt where he stood.

The grizzled man -- Illuminar -- laughed. It was a deep 'from-the-belly' sort of laugh that almost made Ethan want to laugh too.

""Ethan, I'm not in the habit of striking a man with lightning because he respectfully tells me his opinion, especially since I asked.""

""That's good."" He said tentatively, still rooted to the spot.

""Gabriella, offer our guest some tea."" Illuminar instructed, then turned back to Ethan and spoke in a friendly, conversational tone. ""So, you don't like the way I run the universe.""

He didn't know how to answer. It felt like saying anything would be akin to blasphemy.

The grizzled man looked amused. ""Ethan, I am big enough to take your opinion, and I already know what it is anyway. However, it's easier for you to have a conversation if you speak aloud. Now, speak."" His voice suddenly had a ringing authority that Ethan didn't feel right ignoring.

""No, I don't like the way you -- I mean, thee? Thou? -- I mean, yeah, I don't think some of the things that you do... or maybe allow? Anyway don't think they're quite... quite right."" He grimaced and waited for the lightning bolt.

Illuminar chuckled again, though Ethan didn't feel like he was being laughed at. ""Join the club. Membership currently stands at nearly every sentient being who ever has lived, is living, or will live.""

""Nearly?""

He nodded, and he had a mischievous grin on His face and a twinkle in His eye. ""A precious few accept that -- being all-knowing -- I do actually know best."" He then nodded his head towards Ethan's side and gently chided. ""Don't be rude; dear Gabriella has been offering you tea for some time now. Please take it and have a seat.""

""Oh, sorry."" He hadn't noticed her and took the offered cup. ""Thank you.""

""You're welcome."" She smiled.

The tea seemed to be at the perfect temperature; hot, but just shy of being too hot. He sat down on the grass, took a sip, and nearly moaned out loud. ""Damn that's good."" He breathed, then looked at Illuminar in alarm. ""Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to say 'damn', I meant... uh...""

""You meant to say exactly what you said."" Illuminar corrected. ""I don't prefer coarse language, but neither do I unleash plagues for it.""

""Oh good."" He replied, very glad that was the case, and also that he also wasn't being struck down for his opinion that the world wasn't being run well.

""Ethan, should a toddler instruct his parents on how to run a home?"" Illuminar asked.

""Of course not.""

""Why not?""

""Because a toddler isn't mature enough, old enough, or wise enough."" Ethan replied.

""Then perhaps consider that the knowledge and wisdom gap between you and I is

far

greater than between a toddler and his parents. When you're all-knowing and all-wise, then perhaps I'll take your advice on how to run the universe."" Illuminar chided gently and with a smile. It almost didn't sound like a rebuke, it was more like He was simply teaching a lesson.

""Yes sir."" He averted his eyes slightly, deciding not to mention all the terrible things which were happening in the world that He could prevent, but didn't.

""Yet remember this; I will not let injustice stand."" Illuminar said with a powerful conviction in His voice, seemingly answering his thoughts. ""Whether in this life or the next, no injustice will go unpunished and no integrity will go unrewarded. Every righteous deed

will

be rewarded and every wicked deed

will

be punished. None shall escape this judgement, for I show no partiality.""

Ethan grimaced, thinking of all the things he'd done that could easily put him on the wrong side of that judgement.

""Look at me Ethan."" Illuminar said with a kind voice. Surprisingly, He didn't look angry but rather consoling and tender. ""I require men to aim for perfection, but have near infinite grace when they try and fall short. If you aim for the bullseye and miss, you'll usually still hit the target somewhere. Not as perfectly as either of us would prefer, but you likely will.""

""I try to.""

""And that is what sets the righteous apart from the wicked."" He replied kindly. ""The righteous strive to hit the bullseye and trust my grace when they fall short; the wicked don't even try. Those who acknowledge me and practice righteousness will receive a great reward and rejoice; but those who practice unrepentant wickedness will be repaid in full for their wicked deeds.""

""But what if they start trying?""

Illuminar's smile became even warmer. ""I will show mercy to all who turn from their wickedness and acknowledge Me, requiring nothing else except repentance, even from the worst man who ever lived. But..."" His smile turned to distaste. ""...but those who practice unrepentant wickedness

will

be repaid in full.""

""I'm okay with that."" Ethan nodded.

""Whether you are or not, that is how it

will

be... so it's good you happy with it."" Illuminar smiled and took a sip of His tea. ""But you didn't come here to discuss how I dispense justice. Do you know why you're here?""

""Uh, the King asked me to come?""

""Try again."" Illuminar shook His head calmly, as if He was a teacher in a classroom and Ethan had merely answered a question incorrectly.

""Hmm."" As far as he knew, that's why he was there. What there another reason?

""Yes, there is."" Illuminar said, apparently answering his thoughts.

He thought about it for several seconds before answering again. ""Because you wanted me here?""

""Correct."" Illuminar nodded. ""Your tea is getting cold.""

Ethan took a sip; it was easily the best tea he'd ever had -- no exceptions -- and he didn't usually like tea.

""You are my chosen instrument Ethan."" Illuminar said. ""I have decided that you will correct a situation in this world that has gone on for quite long enough; a situation you aren't even aware of yet. I've heard the prayers of those troubled by it, and have decided that you will correct it.""

""Don't I get a say in this?"" He replied feeling a little irked.

""Of course you do."" Illuminar nodded. ""I won't force you to do anything; I don't force

anyone

to do anything. But given who you are, the situation you find yourself in, and who is around you; you will end up correcting this situation by your own free choice.""

Ethan raised an eyebrow. ""How can I make a 'free choice' to do something if you already know what I'm going to choose?""

""If you gave Alana the choice between living in a stainless steel shed or a house grown from trees like the houses in Nalatia, which would she choose?""

""The tree house of course.""

Illuminar grinned mischievously as He took another sip of His tea. ""How can she make a 'free choice' if you already know what she's going to choose?""

Ethan opened his mouth to reply, then closed it. ""Oh.""

Hmm.

""But... Hmm."" Ethan frowned. ""How can I make a choice if you already chose me? Isn't you choosing me overriding my ability to choose?""

""Ethan, would you prefer that your wives love you because they were forced, or because they chose to?""

""Obviously because they chose.""

""I am the same."" Illuminar took another sip of His tea. ""It would take more time than we have to fully explain how it works, but know this: I am absolutely sovereign over everyone and everything in the universe with no exceptions. Yet in my sovereignty, I have chosen to give you free will. I could make anyone in the universe do anything I wished with less effort than you use to blink... but then their love would be meaningless. Therefore, I don't override free will. Ever.""

""That makes sense and I'm glad."" Ethan replied. ""But doesn't that mean some people won't choose you?""

""Actually, it means that

many

people won't choose me."" He acknowledged. ""But a robot that's programmed to say 'I love you' means nothing compared to a child who

chooses

to say 'I love you'. I'm not after robots. Fortunately -- being all-knowing and all-wise -- I know how to guide events without violating anyone's free will. Trust me on that...""

He leaned for forward. ""...or don't; it's your choice.""

He winked.

Ethan chuckled.

""But, why choose me?"" Ethan asked after a moment. He wasn't especially... well, anything. He didn't have any special qualifications, he wasn't incredibly smart; he wasn't even as good or noble as he'd like to be, and his dragon side made things worse. He really wasn't special at all.

""I didn't choose you because you are special Ethan."" Illuminar replied. ""I chose you because you

aren't

special. I chose you -- a flawed man -- to accomplish my purposes so that no one -- especially you yourself -- could say you did it by your own strength. That's how I work. I choose the weak to defeat the strong, the simple to outsmart the wise, and the lowly to humble the proud.""

Illuminar leaned forward. ""Do you know what that means?""

Ethan shook his head.

""It means I can use anyone."" He smiled. ""There are 14,728 men in the universe who I could've sent into that dragon's body instead of you. 14,728 men who could've done what you've done, and who could do what you will do. Most of them are stronger, smarter, or more noble than you are. Some of them even devotedly follow me and would recognize me here, for I am known on every world... yet I didn't choose them.""

""Why?""

""Because of your free choice; because you asked."" Illuminar replied kindly and with a wide smile. ""You asked for a fresh start and the perfect woman for you just before your human body died. And foreseeing this, while you and Alana were both still in your mother's wombs, I knit you together to be perfect for each other. And because I knew Alana that was lonely and wanted sisters, I made six other women who would be the perfect sisters for her, and each other, and also the perfect wives for you. I made

all

of you -- I carefully designed each and every single one of you -- to fit perfectly together. Each one adding another essential and crucial piece to the whole.""

""Wow."" Ethan breathed, suddenly realizing how incredible that was. He was having a hard time wrapping his mind around it.

""So the next time you feel like complaining about your life or wishing that I did things differently, realize that there are precisely 14,728 other men who could've been in your shoes, but aren't... and then consider showing some gratitude."" It was a mild rebuke and came across as kind and gentle; it was firm, but not harsh.

""I will, thank you."" Ethan nodded, still trying to process what he'd just heard.

""You're welcome."" The grizzled man that was Illuminar nodded, then He took another sip of his tea.

That's when something He'd said jumped out at Ethan. ""Wait, did you say

six

other women? As in, seven total?""

Illuminar smiled.

* * *

Selene laid on the bed in the monastery's visitor's dormitory, staring up at the ceiling and trying to decide what her next move should be. The way she saw it, she had only two options if she wanted to get home. First, find the ruined temple which led back to Smithbond's base. That idea was extremely unappealing because it was tantamount to walking back into slavery.

Her second option was to somehow find Ethan Ejder and then somehow convince him to re-open the portal to Earth that he'd used. Without modern communications equipment, she thought that was a pipe dream at best. Plus she'd pointed a gun at him on Earth, so she wasn't sure that he'd cooperate even if she could find him.

However, an unrelated third option was to stay in the Ten Kingdoms and build a life here. She'd miss her folks terribly -- even her overbearing mother -- but that looked like the most viable option. It might be her only option if she couldn't find Ethan or the ruined temple. The question was, what kind of life could she build here? Hailey had made it sound like women had some rights here, but not many. Her investigative skills might be useful to the local constabulary, but she doubted they would accept a woman into their ranks.

She grimaced.

There was always the world's oldest profession, but she would've impaled herself on her sword before she turned to that. She didn't have any skills that might be useful in this world though. Hmm. She'd done a short stint of waitressing in college and some subtle flirting had gotten excellent tips -- her incredibly beauty did have advantages -- so maybe that was an option?

But where?

She rolled onto her side and her mind drifted to the inn where she'd stayed. Perhaps there? She wasn't fond of the owner, but she could handle him. Plus his daughter was nice. That of course made her think about Brother Kalen's warning about the girl.

How could an innocent girl like Sarah pose a threat to someone's soul?

She thought about it for a few minutes before remembering that it used to be common practice to burn 'witches' at the stake on Earth because they are 'consorting with the devil'. Plus bloodletting had once been a common practice. Maybe it was just superstition? Sarah was a bit odd, and perhaps that's what gave rise to their fears?

As she thought about it, waitressing at the inn might be her best bet for now.

She smiled wryly.

She had a master's degree in criminal justice, a lifetime of martial arts skills, had been approached by countless professional modeling agencies throughout college, and had succeeded in becoming an FBI agent. Now she was hoping to score a job as a waitress.

Life had sure taken some surprising turns.

* * *

""Seven!"" Ethan felt like his eyes were going to pop out of his head as Illuminar watched him in amusement. ""But I feel like I barely have time for three!""

""Are you questioning my judgement or being ungrateful?"" He replied with an amused smile.

""Uh... no?""

""It will be an adjustment, but you'll grow used to it and eventually love it."" He assured him. ""Besides, you'll need all of them to accomplish my purposes, and to rectify the situation that I brought you here to rectify.""

Ethan took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He wasn't sure how he felt about seven wives. His dragon side was roaring in jubilation and he got the distinct impression that the dragon would've wanted ten times that number; minimum. But he himself... Not so much. He loved his wives and wouldn't trade them for the world. He would also gladly add Rachel to their number, but beyond that... He couldn't think of anyone else he'd want to marry.

""That will change."" Illuminar said, taking another sip of His tea.

""And, you're sure this is a good idea?"" He asked. ""I mean,

seven

wives?""

Illuminar laughed good-naturedly as he shook his head. ""Mortals have such short memories.""

""Guilty as charged."" He admitted, remembering how they had just covered Him being all knowing. He just found it so hard to believe that Illuminar could be that good to him, especially after all the things he'd done wrong. It just didn't seem possible for Him to be so... so forgiving.

""Tell me Ethan, what was your impression of me when you first arrived on Mount Ianis?""

""I though you seemed like the kind of person who would wade through a river of piranhas to help your friends, but you would also be a fearsome foe.""

He nodded. ""If you acknowledge me and keep my commandments, you will be counted among my friends. Even the worst man alive -- the most depraved soul ever to walk the land -- need only acknowledge me, repent, and turn from his wickedness; then he too will become my friend.""

""That sounds so easy.""

""Conceptually, yes. But in practice..."" He shook his head. ""Don't expect an easy life. A good life? Yes. But not an easy one.""

""But why?"" He asked. ""If you care so much for your friends, then why is life so hard?""

""Consider a forge Ethan."" Illuminar replied. ""Men are like a piece of steel with many impurities, and I am like a smith who must remove those impurities so the finished blade will pass the test when it's used. To remove those impurities, I heat the steel up and repeatedly hammer it and fold it, slowly exposing the impurities to the fire so they can be burned away. So it is with men. To remove the impurities -- the wickedness -- in man's heart, I must apply heat and pressure to refine him; just as a smith does to steel. You might not enjoy the process, but without it, those impurities will weaken the final blade and it will break when tested instead of springing back true. Considering the judgement that awaits those who 'break' when tested and turn to wickedness, the forge is the better path. Not easier, but better.""

""Hell isn't like a forge though."" Ethan replied tentatively, not sure if he was being blasphemous or not.

Illuminar's face darkened; the first time it had done so. ""And have you noticed that not a single man, woman, or child on this planet even knows of the concept?""

He cocked his head to one side.

Huh.

""It was also nearly unknown for hundreds of years on Earth before it became the dominant view. However, I do not decree eternal judgements for non-eternal crimes, no matter how severe. I will punish all injustice, for it would be unjust for me not to. I will repay each man according to his deeds -- whether good or bad -- with no partiality. A man who practices wickedness in life has much to fear unless he repents before he dies, for my judgement is great and terrible towards those who practice terrible wickedness...""

Illuminar's eyes blazed and Ethan was left in no doubt that what He was saying was the absolute truth. He actually felt himself start to tremble with the sheer force of the power behind Illuminar's words. His gaze was so great and terrible that the worst man alive might be scared straight if he saw it. Somehow, Ethan guessed that everything he'd heard about fire and brimstone fell far short of the great and terrible truth...

...but.

But then Illuminar's expression softened to be among the kindest and most caring expressions he'd ever seen. There was a deep pool of love, affection, and caring behind them; like the most loving father to his most precious child. There was a warmth and comfort there that seemed too good to be true. It was the promise of a gentle embrace; one in which he didn't think it was possible to feel unloved.

CHAPTER 27: The road less traveled

* * *

Kendra started feathering her airship's sails to reduce speed as she neared the crowded airspace of the wood elven capital city of Nalatia. Everything in her wanted to turn around, but she needed to warn Ethan -- and more importantly Taloni -- that Lord Delmar almost certainly knew that they were in the city. He would probably make a move by the end of the day and it was already past well past noon. That left the dragon huntress precious little time to find a berth, dock, find the Argo, and warn the crew of the impending danger.

She took a deep breath as she remembered the

other

thing that she needed to do while she was here. While everything in her was united in its desire to save the Fey teen, she was at war with herself on the other thing. She knew she needed to apologize to Ethan, but everything in her was telling her to run; run far away and never see him again, never talk of him again, and maybe never think of him again if she could manage it.

But she couldn't.

Taloni's life might be on the line if Lord Delmar attacked, and she simply couldn't risk that; it didn't matter how little she wanted to see the dragon.

* * *

Ethan felt his mind wanting to freeze as his body wanted to run. He was pretty sure that he was on a mountaintop with an angel and God Himself, after unknowingly telling God that He was both unjust and didn't care. No, it was worse; he'd called God a 'colossal asshole'. He was surprised that he wasn't being struck by a lightning bolt where he stood.

The grizzled man -- Illuminar -- laughed. It was a deep 'from-the-belly' sort of laugh that almost made Ethan want to laugh too.

""Ethan, I'm not in the habit of striking a man with lightning because he respectfully tells me his opinion, especially since I asked.""

""That's good."" He said tentatively, still rooted to the spot.

""Gabriella, offer our guest some tea."" Illuminar instructed, then turned back to Ethan and spoke in a friendly, conversational tone. ""So, you don't like the way I run the universe.""

He didn't know how to answer. It felt like saying anything would be akin to blasphemy.

The grizzled man looked amused. ""Ethan, I am big enough to take your opinion, and I already know what it is anyway. However, it's easier for you to have a conversation if you speak aloud. Now, speak."" His voice suddenly had a ringing authority that Ethan didn't feel right ignoring.

""No, I don't like the way you -- I mean, thee? Thou? -- I mean, yeah, I don't think some of the things that you do... or maybe allow? Anyway don't think they're quite... quite right."" He grimaced and waited for the lightning bolt.

Illuminar chuckled again, though Ethan didn't feel like he was being laughed at. ""Join the club. Membership currently stands at nearly every sentient being who ever has lived, is living, or will live.""

""Nearly?""

He nodded, and he had a mischievous grin on His face and a twinkle in His eye. ""A precious few accept that -- being all-knowing -- I do actually know best."" He then nodded his head towards Ethan's side and gently chided. ""Don't be rude; dear Gabriella has been offering you tea for some time now. Please take it and have a seat.""

""Oh, sorry."" He hadn't noticed her and took the offered cup. ""Thank you.""

""You're welcome."" She smiled.

The tea seemed to be at the perfect temperature; hot, but just shy of being too hot. He sat down on the grass, took a sip, and nearly moaned out loud. ""Damn that's good."" He breathed, then looked at Illuminar in alarm. ""Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to say 'damn', I meant... uh...""

""You meant to say exactly what you said."" Illuminar corrected. ""I don't prefer coarse language, but neither do I unleash plagues for it.""

""Oh good."" He replied, very glad that was the case, and also that he also wasn't being struck down for his opinion that the world wasn't being run well.

""Ethan, should a toddler instruct his parents on how to run a home?"" Illuminar asked.

""Of course not.""

""Why not?""

""Because a toddler isn't mature enough, old enough, or wise enough."" Ethan replied.

""Then perhaps consider that the knowledge and wisdom gap between you and I is

far

greater than between a toddler and his parents. When you're all-knowing and all-wise, then perhaps I'll take your advice on how to run the universe."" Illuminar chided gently and with a smile. It almost didn't sound like a rebuke, it was more like He was simply teaching a lesson.

""Yes sir."" He averted his eyes slightly, deciding not to mention all the terrible things which were happening in the world that He could prevent, but didn't.

""Yet remember this; I will not let injustice stand."" Illuminar said with a powerful conviction in His voice, seemingly answering his thoughts. ""Whether in this life or the next, no injustice will go unpunished and no integrity will go unrewarded. Every righteous deed

will

be rewarded and every wicked deed

will

be punished. None shall escape this judgement, for I show no partiality.""

Ethan grimaced, thinking of all the things he'd done that could easily put him on the wrong side of that judgement.

""Look at me Ethan."" Illuminar said with a kind voice. Surprisingly, He didn't look angry but rather consoling and tender. ""I require men to aim for perfection, but have near infinite grace when they try and fall short. If you aim for the bullseye and miss, you'll usually still hit the target somewhere. Not as perfectly as either of us would prefer, but you likely will.""

""I try to.""

""And that is what sets the righteous apart from the wicked."" He replied kindly. ""The righteous strive to hit the bullseye and trust my grace when they fall short; the wicked don't even try. Those who acknowledge me and practice righteousness will receive a great reward and rejoice; but those who practice unrepentant wickedness will be repaid in full for their wicked deeds.""

""But what if they start trying?""

Illuminar's smile became even warmer. ""I will show mercy to all who turn from their wickedness and acknowledge Me, requiring nothing else except repentance, even from the worst man who ever lived. But..."" His smile turned to distaste. ""...but those who practice unrepentant wickedness

will

be repaid in full.""

""I'm okay with that."" Ethan nodded.

""Whether you are or not, that is how it

will

be... so it's good you happy with it."" Illuminar smiled and took a sip of His tea. ""But you didn't come here to discuss how I dispense justice. Do you know why you're here?""

""Uh, the King asked me to come?""

""Try again."" Illuminar shook His head calmly, as if He was a teacher in a classroom and Ethan had merely answered a question incorrectly.

""Hmm."" As far as he knew, that's why he was there. What there another reason?

""Yes, there is."" Illuminar said, apparently answering his thoughts.

He thought about it for several seconds before answering again. ""Because you wanted me here?""

""Correct."" Illuminar nodded. ""Your tea is getting cold.""

Ethan took a sip; it was easily the best tea he'd ever had -- no exceptions -- and he didn't usually like tea.

""You are my chosen instrument Ethan."" Illuminar said. ""I have decided that you will correct a situation in this world that has gone on for quite long enough; a situation you aren't even aware of yet. I've heard the prayers of those troubled by it, and have decided that you will correct it.""

""Don't I get a say in this?"" He replied feeling a little irked.

""Of course you do."" Illuminar nodded. ""I won't force you to do anything; I don't force

anyone

to do anything. But given who you are, the situation you find yourself in, and who is around you; you will end up correcting this situation by your own free choice.""

Ethan raised an eyebrow. ""How can I make a 'free choice' to do something if you already know what I'm going to choose?""

""If you gave Alana the choice between living in a stainless steel shed or a house grown from trees like the houses in Nalatia, which would she choose?""

""The tree house of course.""

Illuminar grinned mischievously as He took another sip of His tea. ""How can she make a 'free choice' if you already know what she's going to choose?""

Ethan opened his mouth to reply, then closed it. ""Oh.""

Hmm.

""But... Hmm."" Ethan frowned. ""How can I make a choice if you already chose me? Isn't you choosing me overriding my ability to choose?""

""Ethan, would you prefer that your wives love you because they were forced, or because they chose to?""

""Obviously because they chose.""

""I am the same."" Illuminar took another sip of His tea. ""It would take more time than we have to fully explain how it works, but know this: I am absolutely sovereign over everyone and everything in the universe with no exceptions. Yet in my sovereignty, I have chosen to give you free will. I could make anyone in the universe do anything I wished with less effort than you use to blink... but then their love would be meaningless. Therefore, I don't override free will. Ever.""

""That makes sense and I'm glad."" Ethan replied. ""But doesn't that mean some people won't choose you?""

""Actually, it means that

many

people won't choose me."" He acknowledged. ""But a robot that's programmed to say 'I love you' means nothing compared to a child who

chooses

to say 'I love you'. I'm not after robots. Fortunately -- being all-knowing and all-wise -- I know how to guide events without violating anyone's free will. Trust me on that...""

He leaned for forward. ""...or don't; it's your choice.""

He winked.

Ethan chuckled.

""But, why choose me?"" Ethan asked after a moment. He wasn't especially... well, anything. He didn't have any special qualifications, he wasn't incredibly smart; he wasn't even as good or noble as he'd like to be, and his dragon side made things worse. He really wasn't special at all.

""I didn't choose you because you are special Ethan."" Illuminar replied. ""I chose you because you

aren't

special. I chose you -- a flawed man -- to accomplish my purposes so that no one -- especially you yourself -- could say you did it by your own strength. That's how I work. I choose the weak to defeat the strong, the simple to outsmart the wise, and the lowly to humble the proud.""

Illuminar leaned forward. ""Do you know what that means?""

Ethan shook his head.

""It means I can use anyone."" He smiled. ""There are 14,728 men in the universe who I could've sent into that dragon's body instead of you. 14,728 men who could've done what you've done, and who could do what you will do. Most of them are stronger, smarter, or more noble than you are. Some of them even devotedly follow me and would recognize me here, for I am known on every world... yet I didn't choose them.""

""Why?""

""Because of your free choice; because you asked."" Illuminar replied kindly and with a wide smile. ""You asked for a fresh start and the perfect woman for you just before your human body died. And foreseeing this, while you and Alana were both still in your mother's wombs, I knit you together to be perfect for each other. And because I knew Alana that was lonely and wanted sisters, I made six other women who would be the perfect sisters for her, and each other, and also the perfect wives for you. I made

all

of you -- I carefully designed each and every single one of you -- to fit perfectly together. Each one adding another essential and crucial piece to the whole.""

""Wow."" Ethan breathed, suddenly realizing how incredible that was. He was having a hard time wrapping his mind around it.

""So the next time you feel like complaining about your life or wishing that I did things differently, realize that there are precisely 14,728 other men who could've been in your shoes, but aren't... and then consider showing some gratitude."" It was a mild rebuke and came across as kind and gentle; it was firm, but not harsh.

""I will, thank you."" Ethan nodded, still trying to process what he'd just heard.

""You're welcome."" The grizzled man that was Illuminar nodded, then He took another sip of his tea.

That's when something He'd said jumped out at Ethan. ""Wait, did you say

six

other women? As in, seven total?""

Illuminar smiled.

Selene laid on the bed in the monastery's visitor's dormitory, staring up at the ceiling and trying to decide what her next move should be.

Life had sure taken some surprising turns.

* * *

""Seven!"" Ethan felt like his eyes were going to pop out of his head as Illuminar watched him in amusement. ""But I feel like I barely have time for three!""

""Are you questioning my judgement or being ungrateful?"" He replied with an amused smile.

""Uh... no?""

""It will be an adjustment, but you'll grow used to it and eventually love it."" He assured him. ""Besides, you'll need all of them to accomplish my purposes, and to rectify the situation that I brought you here to rectify.""

Ethan took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He wasn't sure how he felt about seven wives. His dragon side was roaring in jubilation and he got the distinct impression that the dragon would've wanted ten times that number; minimum. But he himself... Not so much. He loved his wives and wouldn't trade them for the world. He would also gladly add Rachel to their number, but beyond that... He couldn't think of anyone else he'd want to marry.

""That will change."" Illuminar said, taking another sip of His tea.

""And, you're sure this is a good idea?"" He asked. ""I mean,

seven

wives?""

Illuminar laughed good-naturedly as he shook his head. ""Mortals have such short memories.""

""Guilty as charged."" He admitted, remembering how they had just covered Him being all knowing. He just found it so hard to believe that Illuminar could be that good to him, especially after all the things he'd done wrong. It just didn't seem possible for Him to be so... so forgiving.

""Tell me Ethan, what was your impression of me when you first arrived on Mount Ianis?""

""I though you seemed like the kind of person who would wade through a river of piranhas to help your friends, but you would also be a fearsome foe.""

He nodded. ""If you acknowledge me and keep my commandments, you will be counted among my friends. Even the worst man alive -- the most depraved soul ever to walk the land -- need only acknowledge me, repent, and turn from his wickedness; then he too will become my friend.""

""That sounds so easy.""

""Conceptually, yes. But in practice..."" He shook his head. ""Don't expect an easy life. A good life? Yes. But not an easy one.""

""But why?"" He asked. ""If you care so much for your friends, then why is life so hard?""

""Consider a forge Ethan."" Illuminar replied. ""Men are like a piece of steel with many impurities, and I am like a smith who must remove those impurities so the finished blade will pass the test when it's used. To remove those impurities, I heat the steel up and repeatedly hammer it and fold it, slowly exposing the impurities to the fire so they can be burned away. So it is with men. To remove the impurities -- the wickedness -- in man's heart, I must apply heat and pressure to refine him; just as a smith does to steel. You might not enjoy the process, but without it, those impurities will weaken the final blade and it will break when tested instead of springing back true. Considering the judgement that awaits those who 'break' when tested and turn to wickedness, the forge is the better path. Not easier, but better.""

""Hell isn't like a forge though."" Ethan replied tentatively, not sure if he was being blasphemous or not.

Illuminar's face darkened; the first time it had done so. ""And have you noticed that not a single man, woman, or child on this planet even knows of the concept?""

He cocked his head to one side.

Huh.

""It was also nearly unknown for hundreds of years on Earth before it became the dominant view. However, I do not decree eternal judgements for non-eternal crimes, no matter how severe. I will punish all injustice, for it would be unjust for me not to. I will repay each man according to his deeds -- whether good or bad -- with no partiality. A man who practices wickedness in life has much to fear unless he repents before he dies, for my judgement is great and terrible towards those who practice terrible wickedness...""

Illuminar's eyes blazed and Ethan was left in no doubt that what He was saying was the absolute truth. He actually felt himself start to tremble with the sheer force of the power behind Illuminar's words. His gaze was so great and terrible that the worst man alive might be scared straight if he saw it. Somehow, Ethan guessed that everything he'd heard about fire and brimstone fell far short of the great and terrible truth...

...but.

But then Illuminar's expression softened to be among the kindest and most caring expressions he'd ever seen. There was a deep pool of love, affection, and caring behind them; like the most loving father to his most precious child. There was a warmth and comfort there that seemed too good to be true. It was the promise of a gentle embrace; one in which he didn't think it was possible to feel unloved.",,2025-08-15T19:17:42.092065,3501,2.0

CHAPTER 6 - COST

David sat across our dining room table from me our laptop open in front of him with bank statements spread out neatly either side. He was ashen faced and stony eyed painfully aware by now of my betrayal yet only just learning of the money Tahlia had taken from us. I'd never seen David cry before, maybe at a funeral once of an old Uncle of his, but all our parents are still alive so nothing had ever really moved him to actual tears. Not until the one true love of his life couldn't control her desire to submit to a teenaged schoolgirl bully.

He was trying so hard to keep it all together as he looked up from the screen to me,

'How could you do this to us Robin? Aren't we soulmates? For life? Why couldn't you just talk to me? We chat about everything. Or at least we did until now.'

David stopped to slowly inhale. His lip quivered, my actions had hurt him so deeply,

'You know you've ruined our lives don't you?'

*********************

I woke up with a start.

I probably would have sat up and taken a deep breath just to make sure I was awake and not still dreaming . . . if I could. But I knew I wasn't dreaming now. The pain in my shoulders and knees was becoming difficult to bare as I lay on the floor of my bedroom with my hands tied behind my back attached by an old stocking to my ankles also tied together. Shandi had insisted tying me in this hogtie as she called it. She went on to explain that I might be a puppy to Tahlia but to her I am a pig and should be trussed up like one.

David was soundly asleep on the couch. Well asleep might not be too accurate. Unconscious more like it. Up in my bed snoring loudly was Shandi and one of her stripper friends. Their lewd outfits strewn across the floor of my loungeroom confirming they are both stark naked in my bed. I couldn't help but think one of the first things I'd do once they left was to change my sheets. I was naked too. Still not allowed the privilege of clothing as per Tahlia's instruction before she left last night with my daughter and her gang in an Uber to god knows where paid for on my account.

Shandi and the stripper that had come home with her had helped David out of our car as they stumbled up our driveway together before dumping him on the couch. He was so drunk, half laughing, half sleeping as his head lolled loosely from side to side before the girls laid him down. Shandi was drunk too but she was still very aware of what she was doing as the girl who had obviously driven them home got a pill out of her bag and slipped it to David to 'help him sleep'.

As for me, well I have to say I was relieved when I heard his car pull in.

I'd been laying on my bed worried sick about everything that was happening but still too cowardly to get dressed even though Tahlia, Denny and Flea had left with Carly over an hour ago. I edged while I lay there trying to convince myself to do as Mistress Denny says and to trust them. Trust these teenaged criminals that had infiltrated not only my life, which I had admittedly invited them in to, but also infiltrated the lives of my daughter and my husband as well as our bank accounts and statements. There was not a thing that Tahlia didn't know about me.

But with that familiar sound of my husband's car pulling into the driveway always came some relief. It was a signal that the man of my house was home safely, or home from work, or had simply just come home, that everything was okay and every single day I could barely wait to see him. That's just the type of marriage and relationship we have, or used to have anyway. Before tonight his arrival also signalled something else which I had only just started to recognise since I submitted to Tahlia, when David was here things seemed more normal. Normal in the ways they used to be before I allowed my fantasies to seep into my reality.

Tonight I knew he was bringing home Shandi but when you've been married as long as we have I think you do come to lean on each other through times of crisis. I was hoping maybe we could have a quick cuddle as he come in the door before Shandi might even notice. Then when I first glimpsed him, that hope, as well as any feeling of relief, was shattered. He hadn't come home safely, he had been drugged and assaulted, everything was not okay, and there wasn't the usual sense of comfort and normality I had enjoyed whenever I saw him for decades now.

These woman (not girls) these woman had effectively disabled my husband to the point where he was wholly reliant on them even to stand upright. I watched them bring him inside from my hallway while trying to hide my nakedness from them all. That was before Shandi called me out to laud my husband's uselessness all over me. They called me over to watch while they sullied his unconscious body with their dirty stripper moves. They never removed his clothing but they gyrated their crotch over both his lifeless cock and then his face teasing their victory over this humbled man. Tonight these girls were predators and they had brought home their prey to show off what they had done.

They were clearly mocking me, showing me what they had done to my protector. The man of my house. How they had turned him into a sex toy for their amusement. They made me turn on some music and watch while they danced together in my loungeroom, fondling one another, kissing and undressing like I was watching one of their shows at the club. The girl I didn't know constantly with phone in hand found our liquor cabinet and had me pour them drinks. Then they switched on our television and used my credit card to buy some pay to view pornography while they cuddled on my couch slyly whispering to one another while my husband lay in a drug induced sleep beneath their sexy little asses.

At times they would grind their pussies on his torso, masturbate themselves using his clothing and the natural bumps and curves of his body while they watched lesbians on the screen. Eventually Shandi would say she needed to see something more edgy and had me get my laptop. In no time that was hooked up to my television and the next video started. I was barely surprised when my own naked body presented itself to them on the screen dragged out of the toilet by Flea before being beaten and exposed in that first professionally produced video Tahlia had made of me.

They watched Dani rape me as well. They'd pull David up by the hair trying to get him to watch too but whatever pill they had given him was working well. Watching that video brought the worse out in them. Shandi had me kneel before her, take off her stripper heels and rub her sore tired feet while she reminded me of all my secrets, the things she knew about, the things that would ruin my life if people at my work found out, the things about my infidelity that David was yet to discover and hopefully never would. The things that she knew would make me submissive to her. I knelt and listened as the other girl tied my hair into a ponytail then I obediently crawled into my bedroom while Shandi rode me like a horse using my ponytail as reigns.

I laid down on the floor and let them tie me up in exactly the way I am now. I opened my mouth obediently for Shandi to stuff a pair of Carly's worn underwear inside then I listened to them have sex for the best part of an hour before they exhausted themselves and fell asleep. It must have been when I drifted off myself. But now I was awake again and alert. Alert enough to realise I may be able to trust Tahlia and Denny to lead me as their submissive, to allow them access to David and Carly, to enhance all our lives. But what I had overlooked was that I couldn't trust Shandi. She had no reason to make me feel safe the way Tahlia did. She clearly had access to drugs and for all I knew was a hardened criminal inside my house. I didn't sleep a wink for the rest of the evening.

Unfortunately I had a clear view of the digital clock in my bedroom from where I was tied and gagged. Who knew time could move so slowly? It was near enough to 3am when the girls fell asleep and just past eleven in the morning when the first of them stirred. Bright sunlight flooded our bedroom and for the past few hours I envied imagining what the people outside that window could be doing.

Those who were free, enjoying this beautiful sunny Sunday morning. The women and men at their favourite café enjoying their late breakfasts. The young couples out simply walking their dogs. The joggers and power walkers making full use of the beautiful gardens and pathways that graced the suburb where I lived. I made up my mind for what seemed like the hundredth time since I first submitted to Tahlia, no way was I going to be owned by anyone. My family was perfect in every way before all this. It was worth fighting for.

But in between time I couldn't stop looking up at my bed, at those Girls, thinking how much power and control they had over me, my body traitorously becoming aroused at the thought of not only my own real life Girl bullies but also of the imaginary bullies all featuring in the fake made up stories I had read on the internet, the ones where fictitious Women found themselves in my position their only mercy the imagination of the writers that created them. My body tingled despite everything, despite my drugged husband, despite my total loss of control, despite my fear and anxiety and my desire to return everything to normal. That part of my brain, that part where the wiring had gone amiss and created this sex addict, was always active and cared not for the safety or well-being of either my husband or my daughter.

Shandi's friend was first to rise, her only acknowledgment of me was a smirk as she looked down while stepping over my prone body. She padded out to my toilet totally naked (had she no pride?) before disappearing to check on David who was apparently still unconscious. As she climbed back into my bed she leaned over to Shandi and kissed her, she whispered loudly and deliberately enough for me to hear that she had given him another one and that he would sleep for a few more hours yet. In response Shandi lifted my sheets for the girl to crawl underneath and parted her legs.

'There's no better way to wake up piggy. You'll be doing this for me soon enough.'

Her voice was clear and happy and full of desire and clearly directed at me.

'In fact there is one thing better, that's when the person between your legs giving you pleasure while they get nothing in return is only doing it because they're being forced to do it. That's what you will be doing for me.'

Though with my behaviour lately and the way Tahlia has me constantly on edge I didn't think there would ever be a time when I would be unwilling to lick pussy. No matter who was forcing me. As long as there was a level of coercion where I was being threatened and the sane part of me thought I had no choice, then my submissive mind would take over and I would gladly submit between her legs.

Eventually Shandi did cum, I think she was louder and more animated than necessary given she had me as an audience, but she did cum. The girl was a sweaty mess as she crawled back out from beneath my covers before leaving the room and turning my shower on. Shandi swung her legs out of bed and sat on the edge looking down at me. I must have seemed really pathetic to her laying on my stomach tied up in my own house exactly as she had left me looking up at her desperately from the floor. I could only communicate with my eyes and hoped through this window that she may be able to see the distress and discomfort I was in.

To me she looked evil. It was in stark contrast to Tahlia. I had learned to read Tahlia's eyes so well, they were true windows into her emotions. Even in times like now where I was tied up and helpless before her, Tahlia had this happy mischievous type look about her. But Shandi wasn't like that at all, she had a victim helpless before her and all I could see in her eyes was a darkness.

You know what it was like?

It's like she had been a victim herself in the past and she was going to make me suffer in the same way she had been forced to suffer. She wasn't doing this out of enjoyment like Tahlia did, she wasn't like a cat playing with its mouse, she is a psychopath with a victim, and it truly was a frightening thing to realise.

After a few moments with their phone in hand apparently filming me she took the few steps to where I lay and pulled my head back by the ponytail to look up at her while she took Carly's underwear out of mouth. She unhooked the stocking which kept my feet attached to my wrists but left my hands tied behind my back and only loosened the ties around my ankles so that I could shuffle around. She then looped the stocking around my neck and used it as a leash to pull me off the floor and onto my own two feet.

With the gag gone it was my chance to seek some answers. Until last night the times I had spoken to Shandi everything seemed like it would be consensual, yet here we were David drugged on the couch while I was essentially being held hostage in my own bedroom.

'Shandi, what's happened, why are you doing this to us? Wasn't I meant to be your cuckquean, isn't that what Tay had arranged for us and why have you drugged David? This is actually an abduction in my own home, does Tahlia even know what you've done?'

'It's pretty simple Robin. Your noble old husband couldn't or more accurately wouldn't bring himself to cheat on you. You've spoken to him, I've spoken to him. But for some reason the ugly old fucker just couldn't bring himself to have sex with anyone but his Wife. So we had a change of plans, I brought home one of my Girlfriends instead. As much as I like a dick inside me, no way could old Davo give me the orgasms Lisa did last night.'

I felt this odd mix of pride and shame as Shandi revealed David's true loyalty towards me and our marriage. I was so very pleased, almost bursting out of my skin with pride that he would so brazenly reject these strippers to stay faithful to me. Yet it also made me sick to the stomach that I could ever cheat on him with an increasing number of schoolgirls. Dani had even penetrated me where only David had ever been before.

'So, my little piggy, when your darling husband wakes up I have decided we are all going to have a little truth session. See if he is so willing to stay faithful to you once he knows you have been whoring yourself out to schoolgirls for this past month, huh?'

I didn't stop myself to even think before I started begging the girl that had my hands and feet tied and a stocking loosely leashed around my neck,

'Please Shandi, no. Please, no. I told you last night I would do anything you wanted to prove my loyalty to him. I will finish this thing with Tahlia, remember I said last night, please, if he has been this loyal to me, he will be so upset with what I've done. Please don't break him, break me instead, I'm already broken Shandi, you've seen how low I'll go, just let me stay loyal to him, from now on I promise I'll be good.'

Shandi just laughed.

'Sound fucking pathetic pig. You know the sick shit fucked up things I'd make you do just to keep your secrets from him? Ever danced at a club Robbie? You'd be dancing for me of course. All tips and earnings 100% mine. And Carly too, fuck her, she'd be a decent earner, she can dance for me as well. But it's not just dancing. There'd be special favours for the clients of course. A bit of after hours type work once the club shuts, if you know what I mean?'

I nodded my head sadly, yes I knew what she meant, and it confirmed my initial fears, this girl is evil.

I should have been shitting my pants at the thought of it. But the truth is, while my adrenaline was pumping and heart racing, I had this overwhelming feeling that this could not be real and that everything would be okay.

I guess the first thing is I truly believed that David would forgive me. If I am upfront with him and honest and given what our marriage clearly means to him, then I think he would be willing to help me through this. Support me and help me stop putting myself in these situations. And he likes Denny, I'm not sure either of us are quite ready yet to admit that our daughter may be a lesbian, but if Denny loves her as much as she says and Carly is happy, then that's all that really matters.

The other reason I wasn't overly worried was I knew Tahlia could get me out of this. She controlled Shandi, she controls everyone and there's no way she is going to let Shandi do these things. And failing any of that, there was always the police I could go to. Surely what she was doing was illegal. Well drugging my husband then holding us both hostage in our own home would be a good starting point for the case against her.

She pulled at my leash for me to follow her into the bathroom,

'First you do what you have to do. Remember piggies don't get to piss in the toilet, you can squat down in the tub and have it all splash back up your legs. Then when you're done we're going on a little tour of your house before David wakes up.'

Having been tied up so long and despite this ridiculous position I was in, with Shandi still holding my makeshift leash, I had no trouble releasing my urine into our bath. I was absolutely bursting and as much as I tried to avoid it, the hot piss did splash back up on the bottom of my legs. To be forced to pee like this, in front of her, was unavoidably humiliating and disgusting. It solidified my early thoughts that there was no way Shandi was going to get away with this.

The tour of our house was actually a robbery of sorts. Shandi took any little thing she could find of value and pocketed it. But with every little thing she took the more determined I became to stop her. My submission to Tahlia might have forced elements to it but what Shandi was doing was simply out right illegal. I didn't know what Tahlia's reaction would be, but I knew the law well enough to know once I filed a complaint not only with the police but also my insurers that these possessions would either be returned, repossessed or compensated.

What was harder though was the photos.

Precious memories taken out of their frames and carelessly tossed onto the kitchen floor. Wedding photos mostly, photos pertaining to birthdays with both Carly and David, anything that Shandi thought might wound our family most deeply, all tossed on the kitchen floor. I was made to kneel before them and watch as she ground her soles into them, walked all over them, danced erotically with her stripper friend.

'Take a close look piggy. You know what we're doing don't you? All your most precious memories being destroyed by the soles of our feet. It's like a metaphor for our future together, me and my friends grinding not only your memories into the dirt with our bare feet but also your future. This is what you can expect when you belong to me . . . you will be beneath me always.'

Shandi tugged at my leash and pulled my face down toward the floor in among the photos she was destroying.

'Here I want you to get a close look, kiss my toes, kiss them while I stomp all over your most precious moments and feel me grinding them away beneath my soles. You looked so happy on your wedding day, you want me to show you what I'm going to do to your marriage?'",,2025-08-15T19:18:15.174125,3755,

* * *

Kendra sat alone in the dark on Ralgar and Anthiel's couch, still trying to process what had happened earlier that day with Ethan. She was almost sure that he had been mere moments from compelling her to have sex with him. She swallowed hard and tried to control her stomach's reaction to that. Ethan hadn't met her eye since it had happened, and she wasn't sure she wanted him to.

Then again, a part of her did.

She had heard of 'abject lust' before, but had never felt it herself; not with how detached and disciplined the Aldmiri had trained her to be. But what she'd felt over her bond with Ethan... That was something else. She shuddered every time she recalled it, and she couldn't tell if it was a good shudder or a bad shudder.

Her stomach lurched.

She drank down the last of the anti-nausea tea that Mirella had so kindly offered to make, but it only helped a little. And then there was the fact that Ethan had jumped between her and that mage to protect her.

Why?

He almost seemed to treat her like one of his wives. She had seen countless dragons defend their hoards before, even to the death. There was no doubt that Ethan felt that way about his wives and would die to protect them.

But her?

After what she'd done?

And yet she couldn't deny her eyes. He had looked exactly like a dragon who was ready to die defending his hoard; like Ethan ready to die defending his wives... and it had been for her. Obviously it must have something to do with their bond, but she still couldn't wrap her head around it.

The previous day she'd been wondering if the Argo's crew would fight for her. Now she knew they would. Or at least Ethan would, and she was sure his wives would follow his lead.

They were willing to fight for her.

She felt her throat get a bit tight and swallowed hard. She blinked several times as some extra liquid in her eyes threatened to make her vision blurry.

They were willing to fight for her.

She swallowed hard and blinked several times trying to clear her eyes. She had literally never had that before. Even her former squad mates only fought for her because she was useful to them; an asset. But it wasn't like that with Ethan and his wives. They were willing to fight for

her

. Not for what she could do for them, just for her as a person.

She didn't know what to do with that.

In fact, she--

She was shaken from her reverie by movement outside the door. There was the sound of scuffling and someone bumped into the door. Moments later, it opened. Ethan's disguise gem form came through the door, supporting Selene on one side while Beth and Alana were supporting her on the other side. The Brazilian woman's head was lolling slightly.

""S'up here? Back in the back place where the--"" She hiccupped, then belched. Kendra could almost smell the whiskey on her breath from where she was sitting.

Ethan looked at her, and then averted his eyes. ""Could we set her on the couch?""

Kendra got up and the movement appeared to draw the drunk woman's eyes. ""Ken-ra. How doin' you?""

The dragon huntress rolled her eyes. ""What happened? She doesn't seem the type to indulge in the sauce.""

Ethan, Alana, and Beth lowered the caramel-haired beauty down onto the couch, where she appeared to pass out almost instantly. Even drunk-as-a-skunk and passed out from alcohol, she still looked amazing; far better than Kendra herself felt like she looked on a good day.

It wasn't fair.

""I have no idea why she drank so much."" Alana turned to her. ""I don't think any of us realized how much she was drinking until..."" She blushed.

""What?"" The raven-haired woman asked.

""Selene is really beautiful, but her voice is... less so."" Beth explained wryly.

Kendra chuckled, then frowned. What had made her drink so much? Ethan and Alana were stone-cold sober, and Beth clearly wasn't even tipsy, but Selene...

Hmm.

Interesting.

""Hey, take the bed tonight."" The raven-haired woman finally said. ""Neither Selene nor I enjoyed waking up and having to avoid a peep-show.""

""Are you sure? Because--"" Ethan started to say, though he still didn't meet her eye.

""Trust me."" She interrupted. ""I'd rather not go through that again.""

""Okay."" He nodded.

There was an awkward pause, then Alana and Beth looked at each other before the former spoke. ""We're going to bed."" Both women said goodnight Kendra, then kissed Ethan, then headed towards the guest bedroom.

That was followed by an awkward silence.

Very awkward.

""Um, Kendra."" Ethan said after several seconds.

""I forgive you."" She replied.

He glanced at her. ""What?""

""You were going to apologize right? For earlier?""

He nodded.

""Then I forgive you."" She said. ""I tried to kill you Ethan, more than once. I put you and your wives in danger too, and you forgave me. How could I not do the same for you? Especially since nothing actually happened.""

""It almost did though."" He replied quietly.

""Yes, but it didn't. I almost killed you a few times, but didn't. Trust me, we're square; more than square. You're so far ahead that I'll never catch up."" She tried to keep a note of bitterness out of her voice on that last statement. She hated how much she owed him.

He took a deep breath and let it out slowly as he ran his hand over the top of his head, exactly where his hair would be if he was human. ""Can I be honest?""

""Please.""

""My dragon side is getting stronger, and I'm not..."" He closed his eyes and shook his head slowly. ""I mean, if you keep traveling with us; if we get the Argo back and you stay on board, then at some point..."" He trailed off, seemingly not able to finish the sentence.

Kendra's mouth replied before her brain had a chance to process. ""That's a risk I'm willing to take.""

Wait, what?

It was?

But even as she thought it, she knew it was true; it

was

a risk she was willing to take. She wasn't willing to part with her friends -- her home -- even if that was the cost. Some part of her brain, some tiny, long-neglected part of her brain reminded her of the abject lust that had poured over their bond. It teased that she might actually like paying that particular cost.

Her stomach roiled.

However, that same part of her brain reminded her that if she did go to bed with Ethan, she could have that indescribable feeling of waking up with someone else there.

""Are you sure?"" Ethan asked. ""I can't always control my dragon side, and even less so lately. That meditating thing you showed me helped, but it's a Band-Aid, not a solution.""

Kendra guessed what 'Band-Aid' meant from the context and nodded. ""I'm sure.""

He cocked his head to one side and looked at her with his mouth slightly open.

""You might want to catch up with your wives."" She suggested after several seconds of awkward silence. ""I'm sure they're missing you, Beth especially.""

He stared at her for several long seconds before nodding his head slowly. ""Yeah... yeah, okay. Good night Kendra.""

""Good night Ethan."" She replied, and even tried giving him an encouraging smile. Okay, it was a small smile and not terribly genuine, but she hoped it got the point across.

He gave her a pained half-smile back, and then headed towards the bedroom. He was gone for less than a minute before he returned with a large folded blanket, which he held out to her. ""For Selene, since I'm guessing she'll sleep it off out here.""

Kendra took the blanket and nodded. ""Probably.""

There was a slightly awkward silence for several seconds as the two of them looked at each other.

""What?"" She finally asked.

""You're a pretty amazing woman Kendra, has anyone ever told you that?""

Suddenly, she felt a warm feeling spread across her body, like sitting by a fire with a warm blanket or having cup of hot tea with a friend.

""Thank you."" She said as the warm feeling spread to her cheeks. ""I don't think anyone has ever... or at least no one who really knew who I was.""

""Well, you are."" He made a thoughtful sound, then nodded. ""You definitely are. Well, good night.""

""Night."" She whispered back.

For the tiniest split second, she

almost

wanted to follow him. She couldn't get the image of him jumping between herself and the mage out of her head. He had definitely guarded her, defended her; fought for her. Plus, he thought that she was 'a pretty amazing woman'. That warm feeling seemed to intensify a little bit, and she felt a tiny smile start to creep onto her face.

She sat down on the couch next to the Brazilian woman. The blanket was large enough for both of them, so she leaned back and covered herself with it too.

Ethan thought that she was an amazing woman?

For some strange reason, the warm feeling seemed to get a bit warmer around her pelvic region.

* * *

""Ugh."" Selene moaned as her head did its best to pound itself into oblivion. Fuck, she hadn't drunk that much in... in... maybe ever? It felt like she was at a rock concert and someone had duct-taped her head to one of the speakers.

""You're awake."" A feminine voice thundered at normal conversation volume. Kendra maybe?

""Not so loud."" The Brazilian beauty groaned, covering her ears.

""You gonna be okay?"" The dragon huntress whispered. She was still a bit loud, but tolerably so.

""No, I got blind drunk because life is fucking awesome."" She groaned as she pulled the blanket over her head.

""Sorry, anything I can do to help?""

""Pull out some of that magic shit for this hangover."" She mumbled.

""Sorry, magic isn't a cure-all."" The raven-haired woman replied. ""You'll need to recover the old-fashioned way.""

""Well that sucks ginormous donkey balls; this God-forsaken world doesn't even have coffee."" The Brazilian woman tucked her legs up and curled into the fetal position. She just wanted to sleep. She wanted this miserable day to end.

""I'll see if Mirella has anything that might help."" Kendra offered, and then Selene felt her get off the couch.

She didn't move.

""Here, try this."" Mirella's caring voice said from nearby a while later.

Selene's nosed filled with the scent of something vaguely tea-like that thankfully didn't make her want to puke, which was a minor miracle. It took her almost a whole minute to go from lying down under the covers to sitting up enough to drink. Mirella extended the small teacup towards her and she took it.

""Thank you."" She mumbled.

""Don't thank me yet; you haven't tasted it."" Her high elf host replied. ""It will help with the hangover, but you won't enjoy it, despite the smell. I apologize in advance.""

She took a sip and instantly had to fight her gag reflex.

She almost spat it back out.

""If you drink the whole cup and have some water, you'll be much better within the hour."" Mirella encouraged. ""I'm really sorry about the taste though.""

""Can I chug it?"" Selene asked.

The other woman nodded, so she did... Then nearly emptied the non-existent contents of her stomach. Her mouth tasted like a combination of charred toast and how your mouth feels after licking rubber.

She shuddered.

Not long after, Ethan and his wives left their room. All of them looked a little... frustrated? No that wasn't right. Concerned? She wasn't sure. Clearly none of them had gotten laid that morning and it showed.

""Good morning, would you like breakfast?"" Mirella asked them.

Ethan looked at Beth.

""I probably should eat something."" The blonde said glumly.

""Are you okay?"" Their high elf host asked.

""Yeah, I just..."" Beth's shoulders slumped. ""I need to talk to my dad this morning and I don't think it will go well.""

""I'll say a prayer to Illuminar that it does."" Mirella gave her a smile that was understanding, pained, and comforting. ""When?""

""Probably right after breakfast."" The blonde replied.

""Good."" Selene thought out loud.

Ethan looked at her.

""I mean, there are people who need our help, and we can't help them without an airship to get there."" She said, thinking of the miners who were having problems with orcs.

Beth sighed and then nodded. ""Yeah, so after breakfast it is...""

* * *

Rachel sat at the kitchen table after breakfast with Alana, Taloni, Kendra, and Selene after Ethan and Beth had left, mostly in discussion about how the conversation was likely to go. The redhead enjoyed talking with them of course, but wished the topic was more pleasant.

""I really hope he changes his mind."" The Fey said with a flutter of her wings, but she had a mournful look on her face and her tone conveyed skepticism. ""Bee has been through a lot and we've gotten so close; I would love to see her happy again.""

""Do you really think that'll happen?"" Rachel asked.

""I don't know, but I hope."" Taloni replied, though again her tone was skeptical.

""Me too, I'm just not sure how likely it is."" Alana said. ""It's possible he could go the other direction and cause real problems for us. I'm not saying I think he will, but it's possible.""

""I think it's more likely it'll be somewhere in between."" Rachel offered. ""Hopefully he'll stop fighting us, but I doubt things will go back to the way they were between Beth and her father in a single conversation.""

""Fair point."" The wood elf said as she looked at her.

Yet again, Rachel couldn't help but notice that Alana had the most beautiful eyes. Their rich hazel color was captivating and the depth of affection behind them was... was... well, as Ethan's mother might say: it 'made her heart happy'. The wood elf was beautiful inside and out, and that thought put the redhead in mind of her birthmark; the one they both shared.

She had successfully managed to block out thinking about hers for years before marrying Ethan. Well, not counting during the walk to see Graflex the dwarf in Arcanum a bit over a month ago; 40 days prior if her memory served her. She still had no clue where the birthmark had come from. Her father didn't have one, and her mother's side didn't have it either, not for at least ten generations prior to Rachel.

She'd even asked Lady Ekthros once before she knew what a snake the woman was. That's how she found out the devious woman was an arch mage, and had gone to great lengths to keep that fact hidden. Few in the court even knew that she could do magic, and only her father's inner circle -- and not even all of them -- knew that she was an arch mage. Sadly, she hadn't known anything about Rachel's birthmark either.

At least Ethan didn't mind.

She found it hard to believe that he wasn't turned off by such an obvious flaw, but apparently he wasn't.

""Rachel?"" The most beautiful voice in the Ten Kingdoms broke into her thoughts.

""Hmm?"" The redhead shook her head to clear it as she came back to the moment.

""I was asking if you think the fact that her father is a Lord might make him more or less willing to change his mind."" Alana asked.

""Honestly, I think it makes him less likely."" The teen mage replied. ""Lords are used to getting their own way, and he's probably no different. Look at what happened with Selene yesterday.""

Everyone turned to the caramel haired beauty, who hadn't taken part in the conversation yet. The Brazilian woman had her eyes closed and seemed to be trying to tune out the world. Rachel didn't blame her if her hangover was as bad as it seemed.

Still, the redhead thought something else was going on with her. She seemed abnormally quiet, and then there was the reason she had gotten so drunk in the first place; whatever the reason actually was.

* * *

""And you're sure you want to talk to him alone?"" Ethan asked as he and Beth walked down the cobblestone streets towards Lord Borden's manor house.

The blonde nodded, though she was looking more at the ground than at him or where they were going. ""Yeah. He's going to fixate on you if you're there. Besides..."" She glanced at him with sad eyes and sighed. ""He's my father, and if I ever want to have a relationship with him, I think I need to talk to him one-on-one.""

Ethan couldn't help but remember the flighty, slightly selfish, immature teen that Beth had been only a couple of months ago, and contrasted that with the young woman walking beside him now. She'd grown so much in such a short time and he found a smile creeping onto his face despite the situation.

""What?"" She asked after glancing at him again.

""I'm really proud of the woman you've become."" He said as the smile spread across his face without conscious effort.

""Thank you."" She smiled back and seemed to stand up just a little bit straighter.

""You can do this Beth."" He continued. ""I know it won't be easy, but you can do it. Consider all the things you've done in the past few months. You've gone through more things than anyone else on the Argo and come out stronger for it. I mean, after angels, demons, Dragos, and Elvin monarchs, you can handle talking to a lord; even your father.""

""Huh."" She cocked her head to one side. ""You know, you're right. I have done a lot, and maybe I'm...""

""You're...?"" He prompted.

""Maybe... maybe I've been thinking about this backwards."" She made a thoughtful frown, then looked up. ""We're here.""

He looked up also and realized that they had indeed reached Lord Borden's manor house.

He looked at her. ""You ready?""

She shook her head. ""No, I'm scared."" She looked up at him with quiet resolve in her eyes. ""But I'm going to do it anyway because courage isn't the absence of fear; it's being afraid and doing the right thing anyway.""

He smiled. ""I love you, you know that?""

""I do, and I love you too."" She glanced at the house. ""I should talk to him alone, but..."" She bit her lip. ""Don't go too far okay? I'll feel better knowing you're outside.""

""There's not a force in the world that could pry me away.""

""Thank you."" She smiled, then looked at the front door and sighed. ""Okay, I guess it's time.""

* * *

Selene didn't feel like her head was duct-taped to a rock concert speaker anymore, but she certainly had felt better. Mirella's tea, lots of water, and some breakfast had helped, but she still felt like someone had decided to practice their meat tenderizing skills on her brain.

She was sitting in the kitchen as Ethan's wives and Kendra continued talking about Beth and the upcoming conversation with her father. They were chatting like old friends, even Kendra, though she was a bit quieter. They all seemed to fit so incredibly well together and she was sitting there as an outsider. Almost literally, since she had chosen to sit at the end of the table to minimize the walking distance from the couch, and the women were sitting nearer the middle.

She could've joined in, and she knew they would welcome her. However, they had such a vast body of shared knowledge about this world which she lacked, so she ended up feeling like a kindergartener in a room full of college students; trying desperately to just follow the conversation, much less take part.

""Selene?"" A gentle voice said from behind her.

The Brazilian woman turned to see Mirella standing there looking sympathetic. ""I was planning to do some gardening this morning and could use some help. The sun might do you some good.""

She glanced at Ethan's wives plus Kendra, who were debating the finer points of how growing up in Gralden might affect the conversation.

""Thanks, I'd love to.""

The elven woman led her to the back door of the house and out into a small fenced-in yard with a flower garden in one corner. The high elf had a small hand-trowel, a one-handed garden fork, and a silk pouch in one hand, and she led Selene over to a patch of earth in the garden that was almost conspicuously bare.

""Planting seeds?"" Selene asked.

The elf nodded. ""I've been meaning to for weeks, but kept getting the feeling that I should wait for some reason."" She looked at Selene. ""Now I think I know why.""",,2025-08-15T19:18:22.041622,3539,

""Are you doing okay, baby?""

This question was asked with concern from across the span of a king-sized bed.

The bedroom was dark, only lit by several candles placed strategically on nightstands and shelves, the cloud-hidden Moon offering no further illumination. It was furnished like any normal bedroom would be, a white-wooden dresser sitting against a wall, a desk filled with pictures and knick-knacks that held treasured memories next to it. Other framed photographs lined the walls, ones that depicted scenes of matrimony - images taken from a wedding, dates, and numerous captured moments of happiness protected behind glass barriers. A large bed sat in the middle of the room, the owners of the house splayed out on top of its ruffled sheets, nude and sweaty.

On one end of the bed kneeled a woman who wasn't quite an actual woman. She looked like one, sure, her figure and features feminine in nature - at least

mostly

. A swathe of straight, ginger hair draped across her face and ended at her lightly-bronzed shoulders, curtaining her countenance. Wide green eyes narrowed in concentration, scarlet-painted thin lips pursed above a rounded chin, a wide-set nose flared between equally rounded cheeks. Modest breasts crowned by light brown nipples jiggled on a strong chest with every deep breath she took, bouncing over a flat, firm stomach that led to a hairy set of pubes that were the same fiery red as the locks on her head.

It was what was

connected

to her crotch that led to doubts about the person's sex.

Instead of a puffy, delicate vagina - although she had that

too

- or even a lengthy strap-on, there was a

cock

growing in the space. Because the woman was a futanari! And, as was normal for her dual-sexed nature, her masculine endowment was

massive

. The most eye-catching aspect of it was its girth: it looked as thick as one of the futa's own fat-filled thighs, though its width wasn't uniform across the entirety of its incredible expanse; about halfway down the shaft it staggered slightly in circumference before regaining the same girth as the base when it neared the glans, which flared out even

wider

than the rest of the appendage, giving it a somewhat

crooked

appearance.

As mentioned before, the futa's cock was enormous in length too - hence her distance from the other person occupying the bed. Longer than its owner's

legs

, it stretched across the bed, weighing heavily against the sheets which creased and ruffled under it. Numerous corded veins laced its giganticness, the shaft - which was lighter in shade until it reached the halfway point where it took on a pinker-hue - appeared

ribbed

with the blood-filled tubes, each one the size of a middle finger at

minimum

. The purple-and-blue arteries throbbed as they kept the futa's member at its full, steely hardness, fulfilling their singular purpose in life.

Splitting them down the center, her massive cock rested atop her scrotum and testicles that matched the rest of her endowment in sheer enormity. Covering her thighs and the space on the bed directly in front of her, the futa's wrinkled, darker-than-her-member sack rolled over the bed, forced onto it by the ridiculous heft of her balls;

much

bigger than you'd find on the average male or even futanari, they were comparable to honeydew melons, corpulent and rounded, more than anyone could hope to cradle with

both

hands. They shook against each under their own prowess, literally

vibrating

as they churned up what could only be

countless

quantities of sperm.

""I-I'm okay, Nia, you can keep going.""

The woman - and an

actual

woman, at that - being

impaled

on said endowment, stuttered from the other end of the bed. Unlike her wife, she was laid out on her back, her head supported by a large pillow, her glossy, platinum hair spread across it. Her features were much more

elegant

and near model-esque, sharp and undeniably feminine. Small pointed nose, sparkling blue eyes, plump pink lips - she was gorgeous by anyone's standards, high cheekbones and a pointed chin completing her attractive visage. It was the

rest

of her, however, that really elevated her from beautiful to

head-turning

!

To call her figure

obscene

would be an understatement. Squishing

into

her chin was a pair of absolutely enormous tits that, despite her laying down on her back, didn't flatten into a pancake-like shape at

all

; they managed to stick out high on her chest, nearly blocking her view of her partner, Nia. Alluringly pearlescent in tone, the huge mounds bordered on being

translucent

, the dark-colored veins weaving under her skin readily visible, creating a kind of

map

across her breasts. Befitting their massiveness, her areolas were just as large, the light-pink saucers taking up more than half of her breast-flesh, the matching nipples protruding from the top of them thumb-sized and

very

suckable.

What little of her waist that could be seen and

wasn't

taken up by her fatty hills was conversely very thin, her jewelry-encrusted stomach practically

miniscule

in comparison to her bust - though this slimness wasn't present when her torso gave way to her hips. The

definition

of child-bearing, they flared out farther than her the span of her svelte shoulders, thick in all the right ways and connected to equally-as-wide thighs. Though it

should

have been hidden, the blonde's rotund backside still made an appearance, the giant globes

elevating

the rest of her figure and jutting out from the sides of her legs like she was sitting atop a pair of jiggling cushions.

""Alright Kristin, just let me know if it's too much."" Nia replied, grabbing the base of her cock, a wedding band adorning one of her long fingers, ""We can stop if you need a break.""

Nia was referring to the sex the married couple were currently partaking in - or were at least

attempting

to partake in. Between Kristin's jiggly thighs her perfectly pink and tiny slit was being

split

by Nia's colossal cock, her puffy labia stretched taut around her wife's monster. A slimy, off-white mixture of feminine nectar and precum coated the meeting of their sexes, and Kristin's clit stuck out small and erect from above her gaped lower-lips. Nia's engorged shaft pulsated viciously as it waited to continue its deep dive into her wife's cunt, the

majority

of her awesome appendage remaining outside of it.

Only a little more than Nia's ridged cockhead and an inch or two of shaft were embedded into Kristin's depths, and they both knew not much else of its incredible length would fit. Though they had been married for several years - and had dated for several years before Nia proposed - sex was always the one hurdle they couldn't overcome. The single sore spot in their relationship. A glaring flaw in their otherwise harmonious matrimony. It had been an issue since the beginning, and it seemed as though no matter what or how much they tried, they could never make it work.

It wasn't that penetration was impossible by any means, it was going

past

the first few minutes of coitus that the couple couldn't seem to accomplish, the reason being that Kristin was just too damn

tight

! That fact had been understandable in the beginning of their relationship considering how just insanely

hung

Nia was, but it didn't change despite their concerted efforts to successfully make love over the years. Toys, muscle relaxants, alcohol - none of it ever made sex go any smoother or less painful for Kristin, and they were quickly running out of ideas. And both of them were getting frustrated.

Though for mostly different reasons.

For Nia, she was mainly saddened by the fact that not only could she not

please

her wife - at least with her cock, her fingers and tongue having grown skilled at bringing Kristin many orgasms - but also that she was actively

hurting

her. It made Nia so fucking

regretful

that she Kristin had to go through this just so they could be together the way couples were

supposed

to be! Sure, there was a little bit of frustration that

she

couldn't get off through sex, but most of her negative emotions were centered around how she made her loving partner feel. If she wasn't so stupidly massive between the legs their relationship would be the best it could be!

On Kristin's end she was primarily disappointed in

herself

. Why couldn't she take her wife's cock? She thought it was so sexy and amazing in every way a dick

could be

, but when it came time for sex she was always immediately wracked by torturous agony, the sensation that coursed through her body akin to someone trying to

rip her in half

! Kristin wanted nothing more than to take everything Nia had to offer - which was a fucking

lot

- but the suffering she experienced during their love-making she just couldn't bare. And no matter what she did and no matter how many times they attempted to fuck, it never got any easier.

That was where they were on this night, like so many others before it. They'd had dinner together, drank a few glasses of wine, engaged in plenty of foreplay, but the results were the same. Nia was patient as she always was, something her wife

loved

about her, going as slowly as Kristin needed, pausing and waiting with every new inch she managed to fit inside of her. Kristin was actively trying not to burst into

tears

, her long purple-painted nails raking at the bed sheets, her pearly-whites grit, her face scrunched up in what she

hoped

was a confident facade. Both of them prayed that this was the night that they found success.

But that probably wouldn't happen.

""I'm gonna go a little deeper, okay baby?"" Nia pushed her hips out as shallowly as possible, sinking another turgid inch of cock into her wife, ""I love you.""

""I l-love you too!"" Kristin cried out, spreading her legs into a near

split

like it might help in the matter at hand, ""Fuck, you're so fucking big!""

""I know love, and you're doing so well. I'm so proud of you.""

Taking a deep breath, Nia pushed a little more of her colossus into Kristin's pussy, trying not to give into her

primal

urges to ravish her wife right then and there - that was another thing she struggled with. Nia didn't know if it was because she was a futanari or not, but her body always

screamed

at her to take just Kristin how she wanted, to use her body until she reached orgasm; it was more likely, she thought, that it was just a part of being so sexually pent-up. Not being able to cum with the person she loved the most took its toll on her, even if Kristin did her best to get her off using her other assets.

While Nia was nudging small sections of her cock into her, Kristin could feel her limit being reached; there was a mental

and

physical threshold that, when struck, usually spelled the end of their coitus. Her eyes watered as she felt her wife's enormous cockhead bump into her cervix, a pain grunt escaping her pillowy lips, her whole body burning in a

bad

way. She began to shake uncontrollably when the barrier to her womb was prodded, and her head whipped back and forth violently, her blonde hair flying across her features. With a last curse-filled howl, Kristin suddenly jerked backward until she was pressed against the headboard, Nia's member yanking out of her sex with a sickening

slurp

.

Tonight was

not

the night.

""I'm sorry I'm sorry!"" Kristin repeated between ragged

sobs

as she curled up into a ball, her face buried in her knees, ""I'm sorry baby I just can't do it. Not tonight. I'm sorry.""

Nia immediately leapt into action. Hopping off the bed, she sprinted around the bed, her massive, still-hard, partially sexual-juices sheened cock bucking in front of her, her titanic testicles slapping against her knees. Without a word she crawled onto the bed next to her wife, and, after angling the obstruction that was her genitalia out of the way, pulled her into a close hug, cradling Kristin's head in her hands and brushing her fingers through the blonde's hair; she tried not to audibly sigh at the fact that they failed

again

, putting all of her focus on her partner's pain instead. She rocked Kristin back and forth gently, whispering reassurances as she did. Like she

always

did.

""It's okay Kristin, you did so well. I know it's hard, but we'll get there one day - I don't care

how

long it takes!""

""Well I

do

!"" Kristin yelled angrily, her fists balled and quivering, ""After all this time sex should be something we can do! I

hate

that I can't handle you!""

""Baby don't worry about it,"" Nia kissed Kristin's forehead again and again, ""

no one

can be expected to, erm,

take

what I have. It's amazing and great that you can even fit as much as you do!""

""I don't care, I

want

to take all of you! Make you orgasm! Like a good wife

should

do. But I can't! I'm such a failure!""

Kristin sniveled and wiped at a tear forming under her eye.

""Besides, if we can't have sex, I can never- we can never be...""

""Kristin, it's okay."" Nia told her for the umpteenth time that night, ""There are other ways. We can always look into, um,

alternate

solutions. There are options out there for us. It's going to be okay.""

""I'm sorry, I just get so

frustrated

! I wish I was better.""

""You are the

best

wife I could ever ask for Kristin, and our...

issues

in the bedroom don't change that. There isn't anything we can't overcome together, including this!""

""Promise?""

""I swear, baby.""

Nia took Kristin's lips in her own for a long moment before pulling back with a smile.

""Now, did you want to make you feel better? The night is still young!""

Kristin smiled back at her, but her smile quickly turned to a frown.

""No honey, I'm sorry. I don't think I'm in the mood anymore. I can still get you off though if you want!""

""No Kris, it's fine. Let's just cuddle and get some sleep. We can talk about everything tomorrow.""

""Okay Nia, I love you.""

""I love you too, Kristin.""

Trying to maintain an expression that

hid

her disappointment, Nia quickly kissed her wife again, mentally willing her cock to soften at the same time, her bestial endowment still jutting into the air, unsatisfied; Kristin happily snuggled up into Nia's arms and tried to put the night behind her - like she

always

did. The couple slid under the covers and spooned as they prepared themselves for sleep, Nia's arms wrapped around her partner's thin stomach, her finally flaccid fuckstick nuzzled between Kristin's fat cheeks like it was

reminding

the blonde of her one failing in their relationship. They drifted off, happy as they could be...

Well,

mostly

happy!

...

""I don't know, I can't find anything concrete about it.""

Kristin and Nia were sitting at their dining room table across from each other, having just finished up a delicious dinner. Nia was typing rapidly on her laptop, a pair of wire-framed, black glasses resting on the bridge of her nose, her eyes scanning over the pages she tabbed through; Kristin, always the dutiful wife, had just finished clearing the table of their dishes and had poured her partner another glass of wine, before taking her usual spot at the opposite end of the table. She sipped from her own drink, clicking her tongue as she thought to herself, her massive, braless breasts bulging the front of her red blouse until it was nearly

sheer

, her heavy-set pair resting atop the wooden surface in front of her.

""There isn't like... a speciality site or anything you could check?""

Nia took a gulp from her own glass of wine and pushed her glasses higher on her face as she shook her head in response. Pushing her laptop away from her, she stretched her arms, the sleeves of her plain, green t-shirt bunching at her arms, the bottom hem lifting at her stomach above her shorts; when not in public Nia wore bottoms that were as loose as possible in order to give her package room to breathe. Her cock managed to tent the front of her shorts even in its flaccid state, the pink head nearly poking out from one of the legs, her bulbous balls creating a similar outline. It wasn't easy being so well-endowed!

""It doesn't look like it."" She sighed, leaning forward on her elbows and turning her emerald eyes to her wife, ""Science just hasn't caught up yet - at least not where futanari are concerned. The only mentions are donor sites

explicitly

stating they don't cater to futa and don't accept donations from them either.""

""That's gotta be considered prejudice or something!"" Kristin exclaimed in obvious rage, crossing her lithe arms over her humongous chest, ""They shouldn't be allowed to turn you away just for

that

!""

""It is what it is, unfortunately, and there doesn't seem to be any clinics that are made for futanari either.""

""No In-Vitro or surrogates or anything?""

""None. I've tried every related term I can think of and I'm on like, the tenth page of this search engine.""

""Fuck! But baby I want to...""

Kristin looked away.

""...I want to be a mommy.""

""I know, love, I do too. But it doesn't look like we have any other options unless we use someone

else's

sperm to get you pregnant.""

""No, I couldn't do that to you."" The blonde sniffled, her hands folded in her lap, ""It wouldn't be fair when

I'm

the problem here. Besides, I don't want anyone else getting me pregnant but you!""

""That's sweet, but you're not the problem, love.""

""If you say so...""

""I do,"" Nia responded confidently, ""so then we'll just have to keep trying naturally.""

""Is it gonna be enough, though?"" The buxom blonde glanced up at her partner, ""I mean... we can barely have sex as it is and you told me that your sperm isn't exactly

compatible

with normal women's eggs. So even if we manage to have sex properly, you might

never

get me pregnant, and I feel like I'm running out of time!""

Tears began to well in Kristin's eyes.

Scooting her chair back, Nia got to her feet and moved towards her wife, her barely-contained junk flopping up and down against her thighs. Moving behind Kristin, she hugged her and kissed her head, pressing her face into the blonde's sweet-smelling locks; in turn Kristin grabbed Nia's arms and held them tightly, using partner's comforting presence to calm herself. They stayed like this for several minutes, silently embracing, until Kristin craned her neck backwards to look at Nia, her deep blue eyes staring into the futa's shiny green pair.

""We'll make it work, won't we?""

""Of course we will, love."" Nia gave Kristin's forehead a peck and grinned, ""We always do!""

""We do. Um, do you want to watch a movie or something? I can make popcorn.""

""Sure Kris, but I'm gonna go shower first. Long day at the office.""",,2025-08-15T19:18:27.241818,3362,
https://www.literotica.com/s/between-batons,Between Batons,Unknown Author,,,,,"'Carl? Come on in,' said Kaylee, chipper as always.

Holden wasn't exactly scared, but he wasn't not afraid either. The lube in his crack was reaching room temperature, and through the door came a lumbering figure he could barely see through his white eyeblinds.

He was on his knees, hands ziptied to the bedframe, a leather belt around his waist, and a choker around his throat.

He felt his wife's hand stroking his shoulder as she passed. The very same hand which just a few months prior had slapped Holden in the face in a spur of the moment while they had been fucking. Kaylee had gasped when she did it, but very quickly found that she enjoyed giving him red cheeks, or clawing his back.

A week later, while riding Holden vigorously, she had put her hand around his throat, restricting blood flow, completely controlling the situation. He had encouraged her to speak up a bit in the bed, try new things, and he didn't complain as he was seeing stars while cumming harder than ever before.

He hadn't complained when she had bought a small mischief whip to spice up the calendar-set Friday evenings either, which quickly expanded to become both Wednesdays, Saturdays, and whenever she was in the mood.

This Friday, however, had turned out a little different.

'Thanks. Kaylee, was it?' The barytone rumbled, making Holdens body tingle.

Kaylee gave a sound of affirmation.

'So this is tonights meat course,' said Carl.

'Yes, he's all yours.'

Holden felt a single hand span his entire buttock, and squeeze it. He gasped as a finger entered his ass a bit too quickly.

He felt every nerve ending in his sphincter fire off as the fingers curled upwards and straightened again, knowingly toying around for Holdens prostate. No, it wasn't two fingers, it was one. Carl had to be huge.

What had been Holden's scared, withdrawn olive turtle of a penis, soon grew into the tool he had worked his magic with all these years. Not amazingly large, but it did the job.

The first time they had fucked, Kaylee had called it the most aestethic hardon she had ever seen - a slightly upward-curving, well-proportioned cock, dark red at the head, and transforming along the lightly veined shaft into his suntanned groin.

He moaned, and quickly felt a rap across his back with the now familiar mischief whip.

'Ah ah ah!' Kaylee interrupted. 'Who told you you could speak, Princess?'

The nickname had come out a couple of weeks ago, and stuck.

'No one, Mistr-' Another whack across his shoulder blades. He had provoked her on purpose this time.

'You speak, when I tell you to. Now, tell me why you are in this precarious position.'

'Because I have been a bad Princess,' Holden answered. He knew his part in the play.

'I'm to be punished, and today Mistress has found a very special punishment for me.'

Carl laughed: 'Punishment? I'm no punishment, I'm a gift. Consider it an internal redecoration.'

Kaylee chimed in. 'That's right, because you're such a good Princess, I've decided to let someone do what I cannot.'

Not for a lack of trying. One night, around two months ago, Kaylee had sent Holden a picture while he was at work. A surprise pic of her shapely ass from behind, with a harness, her legs apart, and the tip of a strapon visible between her legs with the text:

'Ready?'.

He hadn't been opposed to the idea, it didn't look too big on the picture, and his work desk suddently hadn't felt large enough to cover the growing bulge in his pants. Lunch break had been taken in his office that day, sending a looping video back, of himself coming to the picture, with 'Ready!' pasted on top.

He was not, however, prepared for the harness to be interchangeable with several pieces. Kaylee had blown off a sizeable amount on different strapons, ranging in size from small candles or vibrating plugs, to what Holden could only describe as a floppy rolling pin, which she had dubbed The Baton, even though it was easily larger than any police baton he had ever seen.

She had spared him the largest one that evening, but he had been into the event; her hands on his hips, her staccato movements tickling his prostate, building up to him firing off his hot sperm quicker than he'd thought possible, and the rolling orgasms as Kaylee kept on until she was tired.

Later, the very same week, she had indeed gone for The Baton. It took a serviceable amount of time warming up for it.

She eased in the smaller ones first, taking her time to slowly enter him and exit him, with a satisfied schlopping sound every time she drew back. He had flipped onto his back, grabbing his cock and jerking off to the same rhythm, but was whipped every time he had been nearing a climax. Then it was time for the main event.

Holden had figuratively felt the earth move as it entered him, it had been as if his conscience had lept out of his skull with every thrust she had made, expanding him, straightening his entrance, setting down her flag and making her mark on his insides.

By the time she was happy with him reaching his peak, he was howling like a firetruck, firing an eager dollop of cum squarely into his nose, pouring down his lips and towards his eyes. Kaylee had licked it off his face while masturbating to her new favourite vista - a spent, cum-dry husband, exposed like a newly-robbed house, and laden with sexual ecstasy.

Carl's finger was nothing like The Baton, but Holden had a certain anticipation anyway. The finger exited him, and soon Holden felt a huge hand encircling his cock.

'Mmm, he's good and hard. What does he deserve now, Mistress?'

A voiceless command was obeyed, and he could see a figure through the eyeblind step in front of him.

A large hand stroking Holdens jaw got him tensed up.

'Relax, boy.'

Carl put a thumb in between Holdens lips and into his mouth, it tasted like mint and soap, and stroked his tongue and the inside of his teeth.

'Good stock, this one. Has he been trained to suck cock?'

'Not really, but he's eager to learn,' replied Kaylee.

That was a truth with certain modifications, but it wasn't for a lack of trying. The Baton was impossible, but Kaylee had been enjoying seeing Holden suck on several of the smaller implements.

A real cock, though? He had never done that. Before he could end the thought he was smacked in the cheek by something. Then the other cheek, before it was placed up towards his face.

Carl had positioned his penis so that it spanned the entire length of Holdens face, he could feel the radiating heat of this monster from his hairline to his chin.

Kaylee laughed. 'Do you like it, Princess? I put out a call for someone, with a pic of The Baton for someone to match its size, and Carl answered.'

I was speechless, and I guess my jaw must have dropped, because soon after I felt Carl's warm cockhead against my lips.

'Do your best,' he said. I could hear the smirk.

Holden put out a tongue and licked it, trying to wet the head as much as possible.

'Properly, Princess!' said Kaylee firmly. Holden spat on it, licked the hard ridge, wiggled his tongue under the head.

Carl laughed, and grabbed the back of Holdens head. 'She said properly, you heard her.'

It was almost like pressing against a vacuum, the head filled Holdens entire mouth. He felt a bit sorry for Carl, as his teeth scraped along the head.

Holden exhaled through the nose, which gave it a bit more space:

'Haha, good boy.'

Carl clapped his cheek with the other hand, frotting the outside of his cockhead through his cheek. Holden's jaw was already aching.

Through the sounds of drooling he heard Kaylee take a few steps behind him. Two fingers, smaller than earlier, but still as eager, entered his warmed-up asshole - and was soon replaced by one of Kaylee medium implements. He felt it penetrating his ring, and he backed up on it, engulfing it willingly. A button was pressed, and soon it sent varying vibrations into his very core, spreading tingles all along his spine.

'Ouuugh,' said Holden, muffled through a jawbreaker of a penis, still only some inches in.

'Don't speak with your mouth full, Princess!'

The good vibrations were quickly replaced by the leather whipping across his right buttock. He felt her hands gripping his hips, going as deep as she could.

At the same time, Carl was stroking Holdens jaw, scratching the back of his head. Carl withdrew a bit.

'Mmm, that pretty little mouth.'

He caressed Holdens lips and cheek before jamming his hard cock as far in as he could.

Holden's jaw creaked dangerously, as he felt the head of Carl's penis wiggle to the back of his mouth. He sighed when it was pulled out again.

Holden did as told, and started licking Carl's member, lapping around the edges of the head, before he once again tried taking the entire head in his mouth. Carl groaned with happiness, and laughed a barytone noise.

Kaylee pulled out with the medium strapon, and soon Holden felt the familiar feeling of the lubed-up Baton press against his prepared and willing hole.

'Ormgrr,' Holden hummed onto Carl's cock in pure ecstacy, he could feel the Baton fill him up at the rear.

""I wanna go deeper than I've done before, Princess. Are you ready?'

'Ready!' Holden answered immediately, and Kaylee responded even sooner.

The rubber member forced its way into him at a speed he had never felt before. Later he was sure it had been a figment of his imagination, but at the time he was certain he could feel air being displaced through his internal organs to his throat. Where it, of course, was being blocked by Carl's cock. Kaylee pulled out again.

'Princess is all warmed up for you, Carl.'

'Good, I'm getting close.' Holden saw their shadows switching place, and felt five of Carl's girthy fingers on his left side grip the belt around his waist. The next sensation was incredible.

Sure, a dildo was a stiff member being pushed into an orifice - it felt nice - but as every horny boy knows, that didn't mean stuffing your cock in a warmed-up, holed-out melon felt like a pussy.

Being entered by a real cock, giving off true human heat inside his asshole, was like nothing Holden had ever felt.

Carl's left hand gripped the belt as well, and Holden could feel himself brace for impact.

'Relax, Princess. No one is here to hurt you.'

'Well, I am, but just a tiny bit!' said Kaylee.

She took off Holden's blindfold, and for the first time tonight he could have a proper look at her. She was her slender self, and both her tits and her mood seemed perkier than ever before. Her harness was taken off, and up close he could see her bare sex was pouring wet.

Bending down on one knee to get to his eye level, she kissed him passionately on the mouth before asking:

'You remember the safeword, right?'

Holden nodded: 'Avocad- OH!'

That had been Carl's cue. He shoved his manhood in and pulled out again rapidly, repeatedly, causing Holden's toes and fingers to curl into almost impossible shapes.

Kaylee was smiling at Holden, as sweat was beading down his forehead. She licked his pearling drops off his face, and sat down in the chair in front of the bed.

At the same time, Carl was hard at work churning Holden's insides to butter. Holden could feel his colon straightening, caressing his tender ring muscle, firing off every nerve ending with friction as the beer can-shaped cock dived into his ass again and again.

Holden tried focusing on the image of his wife caressing herself, drawing shapes around her clitoris with a curious finger while pinching her nipples.

He had never been as hard as this before, he could sense his cock trying to escape from the bed and pull itself towards Kaylee. Catching a quick glimpse between his feet, Holden saw precum leaking from his diamond hard cock, and making a wet spot on the sheets.

He wasn't sure what was the driving force behind it - his wife being as tantilised and sexy as ever before, or the forearm-shaped hammer currently driving into his asshole.

Holden felt his entire pelvis tighten up. It was coming, he could feel the impact of bliss just around the corner, like a man standing on a tube station feeling the air move before the train came into the station.

He minded the gap as the gap between his ears came dangerously close to imploding. Holden's cock fired off a shot that could easily have killed a small rodent, sperm pouring onto the bed in oscillating patterns from being pounded by Carl.

He felt like fireworks. If didn't believe his eyes, Holden could have swore the house had just fallen down on its side.

'Good, Princess, good!' Kaylee laughed.

Holden felt Carl increasing the pace.

Kaylee exchanged a wordless glance with Carl, increasing the intensity of her breath and finger movements as well.

'Don't cum inside him...' she said between pants. 'Cum on his face!'

Carl gave a few more shoves, before pulling out, doing a few quick steps towards Holden's face. He felt the cold air rush in where the cock had been.

For the first time, Holden could admire Carl's shape. Everything about him screamed sex. His entire body, toned and well-kept. Carl's hand, as big as Holden had imagined, around a big, black cock, as large as Holden had felt, stroking himself quickly.

Above that, a strongman's stomach with clear signs of abs underneath.

Above that a sexy grin looking down at Holden, and his wide mouth saying: 'Here it comes, Princess!'

Carl creamed off the first shot as Kaylee gave her first indication of a coming orgasm. Holden's eyes were flooded by the warm sperm. Holden could hear Kaylee coming, yelping in tune with Carl, and just about see her pelvis bucking towards her hand, as the second spurt hit his face. Behind the white cloud, almost glowing through it, Carl was smiling, howling with delight.

The silence that followed was long, only punctured by the three new friend's sweaty panting.

'Holy shit,' Holden said. 'That sure was a redecoration!'

'Same time next week?' asked Kaylee.

'Sure thing,' answered Carl. 'But then I want to suck some cock too.'",,2025-08-15T19:18:34.296535,2467,
https://www.literotica.com/s/id-do-anything-for-my-wife-ch-01,I'd Do Anything for My Wife Ch. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"It started on the drive from my firm's Christmas party. We were half way home when Melissa, my wife of 10 years, turned to me and said, ""I can't believe how much you were staring at Cindy's tits tonight. I'm surprised you didn't drool since you were staring that hard.""

I had two thoughts immediately hit me. One - yeah, guilty as charged. The boss's admin was dressed to show off even more than she usually was and I definitely wasn't the only one who had noticed. Two - there was far less venom in my wife's voice that I would expect. Even after 10 years together I find my wife incredibly sexy and we've had a passionate and varied love life. Yes Cindy was younger, blonder, and smoking hot but she was no threat to Melissa.

""Babe, you know that she was doing that on purpose. Maybe she's trying to get a Christmas bonus out of Shawn."" I referenced a long running rumor that she was sleeping my business partner. Maybe a joke would get this conversation to a safer place.

""That doesn't explain why you were staring, "" Melissa had turned in the passenger seat to face me more. ""Are her tits that much better than mine?""

If there ever was a trap question, this was it. Melissa knows that she has amazing breasts. My wife has the type of body that used to be painted on the nosecones of World War Two bombers and even as we moved into our late 30s, her breasts remained almost supernaturally high on her chest.

""I was thinking of yours when I was looking at hers, comparing how similar even though she's younger. She can only hope that hers stay nice as she ages, you've got a consistent track record of great tits.""

This got the laugh I was aiming for from my wife. ""You always did know how to flatter a girl. But are you sure mine are still nicer?""

I turned to confirm just in time to see her unbuttoning her blouse, revealing those glorious mounds encased in a black lacy bra. It took a honk from behind me to tear my eyes away as the light turned green in front of me. I fought to keep my eyes on the road while Melissa continued.

""You think that her tits would feel as good around your cock as mine? That her nipples are as sensitive?"" Her voice took on the sultry tone that she knows sends all of my blood directly south. Watching her unclasp the bra from the front and fondle her breasts accelerated that process. ""Do you want to fuck her tits, Jason?""

My mouth was too dry to properly answer so I nodded. It had been a while since my wife had been so vocal or so adventurous. It was dark out but I'm certain that other cars could see that she was mostly topless if they looked. She had had the requisite office party drinks but was by no means trashed.

We pulled into the driveway and she didn't even bother to cover up as she walked into the house - saucily turning towards the street and then dropping her shirt to the ground as she stood on the front step. She unlocked the door and turned with a shake of her chest, calling for me to hurry up.

I pounced on her the minute I closed the door behind us, pinning her to the wall and kissing her passionately. I ran my hands down her sides, just brushing my thumbs along the sides of her breasts as they continued south, feeling for the zipper on her skirt. The offending metal clasp discovered, I pulled it down with one hand while pushing the skirt and her panties off with the other. With her basically naked, I finally disengaged my lips from hers to take her in.

""That girl has nothing on you, babe. You're as hot as the day we met."" I said honestly. Some people don't age much, my wife was one of the lucky ones. She hadn't picked up extra weight or the start of graying hair like I did, age had only slightly softened her curves and let her work on her strengths.

I started to unbutton my shirt before Melissa uncharacteristically took charge and turned my back to the wall and pushed. She leaned up only slightly, wearing only her heels, to attack my tongue with hers as she took over my undressing. She nearly ripped my shirt from my shoulders once it was freed and immediately moved to my belt buckle. Making quick work of that, she immediately had one hand on my cock over my clothes as she unfastened my pants.

""So you're saying this,"" she squeezed me firmly, ""is just from me? Be honest."" She punctuated this with a firmer squeeze with her hand now on my bare dick, causing me to gasp.

""Honestly, seventy percent you, twenty five percent Cindy and the other five percent the hot barista at Starbucks yesterday."" I responded as honestly as I could, I assumed rounding the numbers would be close enough.

My wife let out a ""mmmmmmm"" as she slowly knelt down in front of me, my erection pointing at her as true as any compass toward north. ""So there's a part of you that wants to see Cindy like this?"" She with added a light lick to the underside of my glans, ""Mr Stevenson, could you please put in a good word with Mr Angle. I really do need a raise."" She even did a decent job of making her voice sound airier than her own in a close approximation of Cindy's.

""Damn,Melissa....."" I started before I was interrupted with a light squeeze of my balls.

""I'm not your wife Mr Stevenson, I'm Cindy, the slutty admin that you all think is only here for my looks. Well I'm not,"" Melissa continued with a pout on her face which she turned to a smirk. ""I'm here because I'm really good at this too."" She dove onto my cock like it would escape if she didn't and started giving me a sloppy, aggressive blowjob. Melissa was taking me to the edge of her throat on each bob and swirling her tongue around the head on each upstroke. I groaned as she went full speed on me, one hand caressing my balls while the other stroked and pulled at her nipples.

""Mr Stevenson, what can I do to convince you that I deserve a raise? Do you want to cum all over my tits like Mr Angle does?"" Before waiting for a response she knelt higher so she could wrap her breasts tightly around my dick, the saliva and precum from the blowjob serving as plenty of lube to allow them to slide nicely around me. ""I bet your wife doesn't let you cum on her like I will. You can just paint me. I want you to cover me.""

My eyes widened as my wife referenced herself in character, but I was too close to orgasm to process it right then. On the next upstroke I felt the surge of cum rocket up my cock and blast the first rope onto her chin and neck, followed by more that geysered from her cleavage as she continued to milk me with her chest.

I leaned back, still no more than 3 steps beyond the front door, breathless and jelly legged as my climax finished producing more cum than I've seen in a long time. I looked down to see my wife, frosted from her lower lip to her nipples, using one hand to rub her clit while rubbing my cum into her skin with the other. As my brain rebooted I reached down to stand her up and drag her to the bedroom.

""Sit, now"" I growled, lightly pushing her onto our bed. She bounced and leaned back on her arms with a giggle. I turned that to a squeal as I dove down between her legs, quickly hooking one over my shoulder and trying to return the oral ferocity that she had shown me in the hallway. She was close, as evidenced by the glistening on her thighs before I even touched her, and it didn't take more than a minute to have her crying out in release. I kept going through at least one more orgasm, only stopping when she pushed my head away, I layed her back and leaned over her to kiss her, both of us getting a taste of ourselves in the process. Neither of us caring much.

""Well Mr Stevenson,"" my wife continued, back to using her normal voice, ""If that was 25%, I don't know that I could handle seventy.""

I grinned, ""What got into you, woman? You've not been this aggressive in ages. Not complaining by the way.""

Her questing fingers found my still partially armed weapons and she stage whispered, ""Nothing yet but you better get this into me soon.""

Always aiming to please, I did that in record time. It was when I was hammering into her that my wife locked eyes with me, and with a clear and determined gaze said, ""Fuck me Jason, fuck me hard, fuck me and cum thinking of fucking Cindy.""

With the stimulation thus far that was enough to tip me over the edge. I howled out my release, feeling my wife's pussy pulse and flutter right behind it as she too orgasmed. I collapsed next to her and pulled her into my arms as we both came down from our highs.

It was probably ten minutes later, the only noises in the room our breathing returning to normal when she kissed my neck and spoke again.

""We need to talk, Jason."" She said barely above a whisper, having slid to lay on my side, looking straight up at the ceiling.

I started to reply, ""I'm sorry....."" Before she cut me off.

""I want you to fuck her."" She said, like she was asking me to pick up some bread on the way home.

I had no idea how to respond to that. Was this still sex-high thinking or was she serious. And why? And how would I even start that? Being together a long time, Melissa knew that I'd be thinking that one sentence to death until she gave me more information.

""I want you to fuck Cindy, and then come home to me so I can suck her off of your cock and take you back."" Melissa moved to straddle my hips (and my awakening erection) and sat up with her hands on my shoulders. ""I think I've wanted it for a while, maybe not always Cindy, but something about it just drives me crazy.""

In our younger years we had done some crazy sex things, including having others guest stars in our bed. We had cooled on the three(and sometimes four)some thing for a while, and I was more than content with just Melissa that I didn't even question it.

""I know you'd never cheat on me, Jason. This won't be cheating if I tell you I want it.""

My brain was still trying to process this, hampered by the increasing blood flow towards where she was gently swirling her hips against my recovering cock.""But... why? And how would I even do that? Why would she want me?""

My wife laughed the laugh of someone who already knew the question you were going to ask before you did. ""Why you? Silly man. I know you don't notice women checking you out, but I do. And that dress tonight wasn't just for your business partner's enjoyment.""

At this she shifted just enough to slide my renewed erection into her velvet embrace. A flutter of her eyelids was the only outward change, while I could feel her kegels massaging me as she sat nearly perfectly still.

""As for the how.... That's for you to figure out. I don't want her to know that I know what you're doing. At least the first time.....""

First time? Does that mean this isn't a one time? I quickly lost that train of thought as my wife started to fully ride me with my orgasm holding off only moments behind hers.

---

The next morning arrived to that annoying combination of sunlight and birds chirping as my brains slowly started to boot up and memories of last night came back. Not just the awesome sexlympics but the conversations before and after. I turned my head to find my wife awake and watching me. Her eyes had always been expressive and this morning they revealed the worry and shame as she took remembered last night.

""Hey....."" she started shyly, before I leaned over and kissed her, trying to put every atom of love in it to push away the fear.

""I love you. Every day until the last."" I reassured her.

She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened them the fear and worry were gone. The sparkle of mischief and arousal had taken their place. ""I meant everything I said last night. I want, no I need this to happen. I know you don't understand, and I'm not sure I completely do either. But just the thought of that little blonde coming on to you gets me so hot.""

""I don't need..."" I started before she stopped me with a finger to my lips. A finger that had a very familiar scent and taste to it.

""Babe. This isn't about you needing to step out. I know that you'll never leave me for Cindy. That you are devoted to me, to US, beyond belief. I want this so bad. Please, will you fuck the hot young blonde at your office for me?""

I would have laughed if I didn't hear the earnestness in her voice. I couldn't leave it fully alone though. ""Sounds like a hell of a chore, but for you? I'd suffer through it.""",,2025-08-15T19:18:41.997486,2341,
https://www.literotica.com/s/not-exactly-infinite-wishes-ch-01,Not Exactly Infinite Wishes Ch. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"I know these stories are a dime a dozen but they're one of my favorite genres and I thought of this way of telling it with an interesting twist. I hope you like it. Any feedback would be great. There's a lot of ways I could take this one so just let me know.

***

I met my husband nearly twenty years ago at a party some friends had thrown. He was standing in the corner, quiet and commanding as if the party was beneath him. I saw him scanning the room, looking for something and I found myself staring at him hoping it was me. The dark Mediterranean skin of his bald head glistened in the dim light of the room. I noticed the strong, muscular neck and the arms that filled the tight fitting polo shirt he was wearing. The single gold hoop earring the one incongruous item on a man that otherwise projected an imposing appearance.

I screwed up my courage and walked up to him, emboldened by the fact that nobody had approached him despite the obvious lack of a ring. I still remember the surprise on his face as he looked at me. I'm just okay on my best day, I've always been athletic though guys invariably think they're flattering me when they call me thick. But the way he looked at me, I felt like my whole soul was laid bare to him and my physical appearance wasn't even in his top 10 list of things he considered.

""Bold to walk up to me. What's your name?""

""Rebeccah,"" I said. He swears my voice didn't falter but I remember it nearly dying in my desolately dry throat.

""I'm Gene, Rebeccah. It's very nice to meet you. Would you care to dance?""

And so we did. We danced for hours that night. He spun me and twirled me, shifting between songs and styles and making me feel like I was a ballroom professional. At first I was self-conscious of the spectacle we were making, our display eclipsed everyone in the room. But eventually it all faded and I just found myself getting lost in the blue eyes of this majestic stud.

When we went home that night, it never entered my mind to deny him. We fucked for hours and, despite my near exhaustion from the dancing, I kept up with him and the blistering pace he set. Just like the dancing, he moved me around, lifting and bending and twisting me into a variety of positions. His cock was magnificent, the perfect size for me and he carried me to five screaming orgasms before he unloaded inside of me.

That was over twenty years ago now and we've been together ever since. I've given him three beautiful children, a boy and two girls, and we've lived a wonderful life. It turned out Gene was independently wealthy, possessing a significant family fortune. We've never wanted for anything. The only problem was... well... it's hard to explain.

I've managed to stay somewhat attractive over the years. I work out and buy only the best, most perfectly tailored clothes. I want to always look attractive for my husband as just a small thank you for all he's done. But it's gotten harder over the years. Gene has aged remarkably well and looks almost the same as the day I met him. Good genetics run in the family as he's the spitting image of his grandfather whom he inherited most of the family fortune from. That man you wouldn't have guessed was a day over 30 when he passed away. And Gene was similarly blessed. I was more and more self-conscious with each day. More and more aware at the way women would look at my husband and I. When I was younger, I consoled myself that I was almost in his league appearance wise. But as the years passed, I could no longer delude myself of that. I'd see these other girls looking at him, flirting with him, flaunting their youth and beauty. And I'd get jealous and nervous... and... aroused.

It was after one such day where he'd gone to check on an investment he had, a student housing building on campus in Atlanta. One girl in particular had gotten under my skin. A tiny little blonde named Britnee... because of course that was her name. ""Britnee with two Es,"" she said when we first met. She was the resident director and was showing us around. The bitch.

""Mr Adalai, it's so nice to meet you, Sir. You're much better looking in person,"" she said as she blinked her eyes at him. ""Is this your assistant?"" she asked, looking at me with scorn. Bitch.

""This is my lovely wife, Rebeccah,"" he said as he looked around the common room.

I smiled and extended my hand, grateful for the small little triumph, ""Nice to meet you Britnee,"" I said. Her smile curled up in a sinister way.

""I'm sure it is. Let me show you two around the place,"" she said and flounced off. She was wearing a pair of obscenely short shorts and heels. Who wears Daisy Dukes and four inch heels? I mean other than Daisy Duke, I guess. Seriously? And yet I couldn't help stare at her perfect ass. I looked out of the corner of my eye at Gene, curious if he'd noticed the little coed and her pronounced hip waggle. I thought I saw his eyes flick down momentarily before going back to the inspection that brought us here, checking the building.

She was like that for the whole half hour we were there and it drove me nuts. I was so jealous and turned on, I jumped my husband's bones the instant we got home. Within five minutes I was sinking down onto that perfect cock and riding him while he watched me with love in his eyes.

""Please, Gene. Fill me up baby. Make yourself happy with my body,"" I begged. I needed to know that my body still brought him the happiness he deserved. ""Does that feel good lover?""

""Of course, my dear,"" he said and shoved his cock up into me hard. It took my breath away and I had to grip the headboard hard to avoid collapsing onto him.

""You think it's better than hers?"" I asked, scared of the answer but needing to know. Something compelled me to press.

""Who's?"" he asked as his fingers worked expertly on my nipples.

""Britnee's,"" I gasped snarkily as he flexed his cock inside me. God it felt so perfect to be filled up like that.

He chuckled as I rode him, ""Of course, my love. You're the only woman for me.""

I smiled at him but I'd been married to the man for 20 years. I knew when he was holding something back. ""But you noticed her tight little body, right? The way she flaunted it at you?"" His silence simply confirmed I was right. ""Did you notice her nice perky tits?"" I asked as I held my own breasts up to him. They weren't large but they had some sag to them from age and children. I knew they still looked good to him but surely the 20 something coed had objectively nicer ones.

He grunted and shoved his cock up into me, causing me to gasp. His hands pushed mine away from my breasts and he squeezed them, harder than I normally liked but with a possessiveness that I found intoxicating in the moment. This was MY man. ""Of course I noticed the little slut, my love. But she's nothing to me.""

""It's okay, lover. It's okay to imagine her on top of you right now. Filling her tight young cunt with your cock. Your seed. Your love. Imagine that little slut getting everything you're giving me and more,"" I said. I saw the change in his expression. That restraint that he normally had disappeared and something primal took over. He flung me off and remounted me from behind. He wasn't gentle, simply slamming into me and causing me to scream out loud. ""Yes... fuck my slutty cunt you fucking stud. Give me what those preppy limp dicked fuckers here can't give me. Fuck!""

""Is this what you wanted, Rebeccah?""

""I'm not that fat old cow of a wife. I'm Britnee with two fucking E's and all I want is to be fucked until... fuck me... what's left of my... oh God! Stupid bimbo brain is gone. Fuck!"" I said as I started cumming hard all over his cock as it pistoned out of me faster and harder than I could remember. As soon as I came, I felt his grip on my hips tighten and he started slamming in deeper. His hand snaked into my hair and shoved my face into the mattress as he took what he needed from my spasming body. Despite the overwhelming pleasure, I tightened myself around him, knowing how much he enjoyed that and just a couple minutes later he gave me one last, hard thrust as he filled me up and shot his load deep into my hungry cunt.

I collapsed onto the bed underneath him, enjoying his weight on top of mine. He kissed my neck sweetly and whispered, ""You know I only have eyes for you, my love.""

""I know, honey. It's just a harmless fantasy,"" I said, though in the back of my mind a voice was telling me it wasn't harmless and it wasn't just a fantasy. That voice scared me.

After such a thorough fucking, I stumbled into the bathroom on unsteady legs. I had a giant smile on my face, the kind of smile you only get after being blissfully pounded into oblivion. When I came back, my studly husband was laying in bed, still naked. I marveled again at how good he looked. He kept himself in remarkably good shape and his toned legs put all those young college boys to shame. I really couldn't blame Britnee for throwing herself at this perfect specimen of manhood.

I put on an old ratty t-shirt of his, savoring the smell of him that lingered on it and crawled into bed, curling up beside him. He started rifling through Netflix until I saw something that piqued my interest. A comedy special with a british comedian I really enjoyed, James Acaster. ""Can we watch that?""

""After that fucking? We can watch anything you want, babe,"" he said and I cooed softly at the sweetness in his voice as I snuggled closer. I ran my hands along his powerful pecs and down his abs. The hard, coiled muscles underneath the skin were like iron. Maybe I could entice him to round two?

But then, as with most things for middle age couples, we got distracted. Both of us were laughing out loud as this snarky british comedian kneeled on the ground, delivering a routine built around loopholes.

""Everyone's favorite loophole? Infinite Wishes,"" he said and I laughed again but I noticed that Gene wasn't. I guess the joke was too obvious for him.

""Clever... that is a clever loophole for a situation that, let's face it, none of us are ever going to end up in ever. We showed those stupid genies. Stupid genies!""

I was still laughing and Gene was simply staring at the screen. ""Do you not like this, hun?"" I asked.

""I just don't like this bit,"" he said, ""It's fine though."" His whole body was tense. ""Just annoyed when people joke about this?""

I paused the show for a moment, ""Infinite wishes?""

""It just doesn't work that way,"" he said with seriousness.

""Well it's genies honey. It works however the author wants it to work,"" I said with a laugh. He frowned before gesturing for me to start the show back. I let the conversation die and went back to the comedy routine.

""Some people don't like infinite wishes. Not a valid wish, they'll say. Okay. Fair play. I won't say infinite wishes again. Okay, great... what's your first wish then?... Infinite genies,"" he said to raucous laughter from the crowd and myself. Gene wasn't laughing but at least his scowl had disappeared.

""Infinite genies?"" he said with a growing smile on his face. The comedian continued on but my husband kept muttering, ""Infinite genies,"" under his breath, pondering something. He looked at me for a moment then hopped up out of bed. I paused the show again.

""What's wrong, Gene?""

""Uhmm... Hold on,"" he said as he went into our closet and turned on the light. I heard the beep, beep, beep of his private safe. He knew how much I hated guns and had the safe installed when we'd first moved in so that I didn't have to worry about them. I hadn't looked inside in nearly 15 years and he almost never opened it.

""Honey?"" I called out, concerned. ""What do you need in your safe at this time of night?""

He came out of the closet looking uncharacteristically embarrassed. Almost sheepish. Honestly it was the most disconcerting expression on the man. I'd never seen him look like this. He held something behind his back and I was starting to get nervous. ""I... Uhmm... I've kept a secret from you, Rebeccah,"" he told me. As stupid and irrational as it sounded, my mind instantly snapped to Britnee. Had they met before? Was that why she was so flirty? That bitch!

I kept my cool and reined in my emotions, forcing sweetness into my voice, I asked, ""What is it, my love?""

""I'm uhmm... I'm not... well... I'm not who you think I am... I mean... You know how you've been getting older and...""

""Gene... have you been having an affair?""

He blinked at me, stunned before laughing out loud, ""What? No!"" he said. The truthfulness in the response was reassuring, ""No... of course not. No... It's just... I'm... well.""

""Just tell me then Gene. We'll get through anything, I promise. But please tell me because you're really scaring me.""

He pulled out something from behind his back. It was a small golden object that looked like a teapot... or... a genie lamp? ""I'm a genie... or... I used to be?"" he said letting the silence hang in the air.

What did he say? A genie? What? I looked at him and nearly fell off the bed laughing. ""Oh god... you had me... where the hell did you get that? How long have you been waiting for something on TV to bring up genies so you could make this joke?""

He sat down in bed again, cradling the faux genie lamp in his arms as gently as he'd ever held any of our children, ""It's not a joke, Rebeccah. I'm serious.""

""Seriously hilarious,"" I told him still chortling.

""Rebeccah. Why do you think I haven't aged?""

""Stop, Gene. I'm not going to play this silly game.""

""Rebeccah, listen to me. Find a picture of me. Or my grandfather. Find one anywhere and look at them. Really look at them.""

Something about his tone told me I should play along. I grabbed our wedding album and flipped through it, looking for a good picture. ""Hold it up and look at them."" I did as he instructed. They were remarkably similar. In fact, nearly identical. The only difference was... the scar. About a week before the wedding we'd gone on a rafting trip. It had started out pretty rough and, at one point, I'd whacked him on the head hard with a paddle, cutting him pretty good and giving him a nice scar across his bald scalp just in time for the wedding.

I flicked the light on and looked at him now. The scar wasn't there. ""Find a picture of my grandfather,"" he whispered. I rummaged through the drawers and found an old family photo album. There was a slightly grainy picture of his grandfather next to a beautiful woman. They looked like quite the happy couple. His grandfather also looked exactly like Gene. Exactly. I flipped through some more. And there were more photos of the two of them. His wife kept aging and he didn't. He stayed exactly the same... exactly like Gene.

""What the fuck, Gene? What the actual fuck? Tell me the truth!"" I said, feeling pretty worked up at this moment.

""I... that's not my Grandfather. That's me, Becks. I've been free for over twenty six hundred years. The story of Aladdin is my story. Mostly at least. He's my last and greatest Master. The one that freed me.""

I laughed nervously but his eyes bore into me, searching for something. I knew when my husband was lying or keeping something from me. This wasn't that. ""But your dad... I've met him?""

Finally he gave a little laugh. A nervous snicker. ""That's my son actually. That's been the easiest way to do this. I pass my wealth to a kid, fake my death then come back as my own grandson.""

""This is messed up, Gene,"" I told him but my mind was spinning. I was imagining growing old beside a man who never aged, ""Did you tell the other ones?""

He nodded his head, ""I had to. I couldn't not tell them. Usually it's around this time anyways. With the kids grown and... ""

""Wait... does our son know, already?""

He shook his head, ""No... No... of course not, my love. You deserve to know first, of course. Stupid as it sounds, it made me feel better knowing I was the first person he told. Well, the first living person.

""Why now? Just because of the stupid genie bit on TV?""

""No... well... yes, actually. It was what he said.""

""The infinite wishes, part?""

He shook his head, ""No..."" he paused and I could see him calculating my reaction, ""The infinite genies part.""

""Wait... that would work?""

""Yeah... sort of... I don't think you could actually wish for infinite genies. But you could use one wish to wish for one more genie lamp to be brought to you or made. There are thousands of genie lamps on earth and millions of genies trapped in the land of the Efreets.""

""Land of the..."" I said.

""It's where I'm from,"" he said, shaking his head, ""Not important right now. The point is, I could go through them one at a time and spend one wish getting whatever I... whatever we wanted, one wish asking for another genie lamp and one wish freeing them. I could free all my brothers and sisters,"" he said. He was looking a little manic but the sparkle in his eye was the same one he got when he was excited about a new project. His passion for things was infectious and I jumped out of bed, giving him a huge hug.

""Okay... let's do it. We just need to find a genie to start, right?""

He nodded, ""Yup. But I don't know where any are. We might spend years looking for one. Centuries even. I've spent some time looking and they're incredibly hard to find. I've only ever found one.""

""You found a genie? What would a former genie wish for from another genie?""

""Perfect health, to always be able to find my soul mate in each lifetime and the freedom of the other genie,"" he said.

""So that's how you became... like this? Immortal?""

He shook his head, ""No... I was unaging before but I was otherwise mortal and normal. I got sick and tired of falling ill or having to spend two months healing a broken bone. So now I don't get sick and I heal super quickly. It's quite helpful, I've found.""

I did the math in my head, ""So in nearly three centuries you've only found one?"" He nodded. ""What about making one? You said you can make one?""

""We'd need someone willing to go into a lamp. It's an easy sell to genies. They live under the eternal servitude of the Efreets so the idea of being eternally trapped but away from our former masters is pretty appealing by comparison. But that only works if you make one within the bounds of the Eternal Caliphate.""

I snickered and Gene frowned, ""Sorry... just... Eternal Caliphate sounds like something a teenager makes up for his Dungeons and Dragons game or something.""

He smiled and returned my laugh, ""I guess it does. It's another realm though. A horrible place. I'd love to free a brother or sister but I can't do it without genie magic. So we need to find one here.""

I thought about it. Something tickled the back of my brain and I simply had to ask, ""Does it have be be a genie in the lamp?""

He paused, ""Yes... well... no... I guess not... The lamp binding gives all the magic. But the magic only works with someone who freely consents. Otherwise you could even bind a dog or something and it would theoretically work.""

""And you know how to make a lamp otherwise?"" I asked eagerly.

""Yesss?"" he said, sensing the trap I was laying.

""Then make me a genie!""

""Becks... Rebeccah... I can't... ""

I pouted, ""Why not? It'll make me immortal and you'll just free me with your third wish anyways, right?""

""Uhmm... no... Actually... the maker of the lamp is always the master of the genie. It's how the immortality works. I will continue to live as long as the maker of my lamp lives. Once you're a genie, you can never be truly free.""

""I wouldn't mind, Gene,"" I said. I found the idea very attractive actually. The thought of serving my husband for eternity had a certain... appeal to it.

""It's painful, too. That's the other part,"" he said.

""How painful? I did give birth to three children. And the last one was pretty big,"" I reminded him. Our youngest daughter had been born 15lbs 7oz. It was a record for the hospital and I have a picture of each nurse and doctor holding the gigantic baby.",,2025-08-15T19:18:49.023534,3683,
https://www.literotica.com/s/a-cuckquean-spreads-her-wings,A Cuckquean Spreads Her Wings,Unknown Author,,,,,"I checked my phone and reread the text for what felt like the tenth time in the last two minutes.

Heyyy Daddyyyyy I finally found someone who I think would be a good fit. I'm bringing her to our fave bar downtown. Meet there at 9:00pm tn? Grab the corner booth and get us some drinks.

I looked around my surroundings for what also felt like the tenth time, to check that I was indeed in the right spot. In the bar? Check. Corner booth? Check. Time? Check, it was 8:55, I even had time to spare. Drinks? Check, and I took a sip of my beer as I zoned out and let the combination of anticipation and nerves wash over me.

I pulled at my collar subconsciously as I continued to sip, and took a deep breath. I don't know why the little twinge of anxiety wouldn't go away. Rachel and I had been play partners for a year, and in that time we'd done all sorts of things that'd leave any polite company speechless should we discuss it with them. Bondage, impact, denial, overstimulation, all sorts of anal and various toys, even a shared watersports kink. And we were both really into grouplay, even done it before...but tonight was a little different.

Why? Well Rachel hadn't told me who she was bringing which left me on edge since we normally discussed who we'd be playing with together. I had no idea why she'd chosen to surprise me with this information, but it gave me the vague sense that I'd recognize who she was bringing. Additionally, the not knowing left me feeling on the back foot, which was not the standard arrangement of Rachel and I's dynamic. But, that'd just make taking control later more fun if everything went well.

I spent the last five minutes of solitude checking the door whenever anyone entered the bar, and reminding myself to project confidence and charisma, since I was the dominant one in this dynamic. Finally, the door opened, and I understood why Rachel had wanted to surprise me.

Rachel walked in, a little taller than average, dark hair and dark eyes, brown hair past her shoulders, and an absolutely stunning set of tits. She was in a low cut black top and jeans. Next to her strode in a woman I immediately recognized Rachel's best friend, Lila. Lila was three or four inches shorter than Rachel, had tanner skin, dirty blonde hair, smaller tits, and a cute ass. She was wearing a green sweater dress and I could tell there was no bra on.

My eyes widened with shock and recognition that Rachel had brought her best friend, who she'd known since high school, to an impromptu three-way date and possible kinky threesome. My mouth was still open by the time the sexy ladies arrived at my booth.

""Hey!"" Rachel laughed. ""Surprised to see us?"" Her and Lila giggled again.

""Uhhhhh yes?"" I said, still a little confused, as the girls laughed again. I'd seen and spent time with Lila a fair bit, normally at house parties Rachel would host. We'd both even commented on how hot Lila was, occasionally while we were fucking. But Rachel had always said she thought Lila was totally straight, and also pretty vanilla.

""Come on now, you know Rachel and I talk about everything,"" she said with a seductive smile, ""maybe it's time we try some things together too,"" she winked, holding eye contact with me. I stood up to give them both hugs and properly say hi. Lila held on just a little longer than normal. I sat back down and Rachel immediately said,

""Wait, let me run to the bathroom really quickly, I'll be right back"" Rachel said with a giggle. She glanced back at Lila and they both giggled again, Rachel clearly had discussed giving Lila and I some alone to chat in this new dynamic, her slow walk to the bar only confirming my suspicions. Lila slid next to me on my side of the booth and rubbed my leg with her hand as she did.

I turned to Lila, took her hand o n my leg in my own hand, and said,

""Lila, it's lovely to see you. And I know you know all about our adventures together, but what are you doing here? You know Rachel inviting you here means she wants to invite you back for...you know..."" I trailed off.

""A threesome?"" Lila finished for me, still giggling at my perplexion.

""Well, yes"" I laughed, relaxing a little. ""I mean I knew you were close, but this seems like another step entirely. Also,"" I paused, trying to be as tactful as possible with my next point, ""Rachel seemed very sure you were not into girls. Like at all."" Lila laughed and pulled her hand out of mine and placed it on my chest. She was being

incredibly

forward.

""Well I don't have to like girls to share...do I?"" She said, holding eye contact with me and sliding her hand slowly down my chest. ""Besides, you know Jack and I just broke up...maybe I'm in the mood for trying something new,"" she said with a smile.

My eyebrows raised involuntarily, surprised again with how flirty and forward she was being, until everything clicked into place. I'd forgotten, but Lila had just gotten out of a long relationship that was

not

sexually fulfilling (pillow talk gossip kept Rachel and I informed of all the interesting things going on in our lives and lives of those adjacent to us) and Rachel had definitely been keeping Lila up to date about all of the great sex she and I had been having. Not to mention that a breakup was a great excuse to explore. Finally it all made sense, and some of the confidence and control over the situation returned to me.

""So how much

did

Rachel tell you about what we were hoping to do tonight? Because it's not just a threesome.""

""Well, sh--"" Lila began, before being cut off.

""I told her everything,"" Rachel said with a wicked grin and a giggle as she returned. ""But enough about what'll happen later, how are you?"" She asked me, changing the subject before we got too deep too quickly. She slid into the other side of the booth, her eyes resting on Lila's hand on my chest briefly, her grin widening.

I decided to fight fire with fire. I was supposed to be in charge, and if Rachel was serious about bringing Lila to play with us, I got to make the rules. So I responded,

""Not so fast, Rachel. I want to hear from Lila,"" I said, holding Rachel's eyes. I slid one hand onto Lila's leg, massaging it. I watched Rachel's eyes track my arm disappearing from view under the table and onto Lila's legs, and I knew I'd got my hooks into her. Time to press my advantage. Still holding eye contact with Rachel, and slowly sliding my hand up Lila's thigh, I said, ""Go ahead Lila, we're all friends here. Tell me what Rachel told you about tonight."" Lila inhaled as I slid up her dress and placed my hand directly on her leg for the first time, our first skin to skin contact.

""Oh!"" She started. ""Well..."" she trailed off, as I continued massaging her leg lightly. Rachel and I smiled at each other knowingly. ""Um...Rachel said,"" she inhaled sharply I slid my hand further up her leg, to where I could feel her panties wrapping around her leg, ""she said that you'd been wanting to..."" she trailed off, inhaling sharply again as I slipped a finger on top of her panties and began sliding towards her inner thigh, where her legs touched. ""She said you wanted to have a threesome with somebody where she mostly watches!"" Lila finally rushed out.

""So you did tell her!"" I said to Rachel, still holding eye contact with her and having one hand all the way up Lila's dress.

""I mean you told me to bring someone willing! And you know she needs a little confidence boost to get back out there after the breakup. So I thought I could kill two birds with one stone,"" Rachel said with a confident smile.

""So you told her you were a cuckquean? Or at least wanted to try it out for a night?"" I responded with a grin.

""Well I didn't use that word exactly, I don't know if she's as into kink as we are and how much she knows about all the terminology. I just told her I wanted to watch her get railed and that it'd turn me on too.""

""Ahhhh okay."" I said, nodding in understanding, while at the same time sliding my hand directly over Lila's pussy over her panties, and felt her tense up, then slowly relax. ""How are you enjoying the show so far by the way?"" I said with a grin.

""I'm loving what I'm seeing. You know I've wanted this for a long time, and how hot I think you and Lila are. I can't wait to get home and see even more,"" she said with a hungry grin.

""Hmmm. I think we should all finish our drinks first,"" I said with a laugh as I pulled my hand on Lila and took a composed sip of my drink, as if nothing untoward had been going on, and laughed as both the girls sighed heavily.

We finished our drinks. And quickly, as everyone was pretty keyed up now, I closed the tab, and we headed outside, to Rachel's car. Rachel went to drive, I opened the back seat for Lila, then slid in after her, leaving Rachel alone in the front row. I'd taken an Uber to the bar from work for this exact reason.

Rachel started the car and began the drive back to her place, just about ten minutes away. I looked to Lila and placed my hand back on her thigh.

""So where were we?"" I asked, smiling at her. ""Oh right, Rachel wants to watch. Or more accurately be forced to watch while she has to do something else and be denied. You don't even know how much it turns her on to have to listen to us starting our fun back here while she drives.""

""Is that so?"" Lila returned one hand to my chest, and placed the other over my crotch where my dick was already creating a bulge through my pants.

""Oh yes. We've been fucking for a while as you know. And what I've learned is that she's almost happier when she doesn't cum, or is excluded and teased. Do you think you have that kind of teasing in you? You guys are so close after all..."" I slid one hand over her chest, while holding eye contact, cupping one of her tits in my hand. Finally, after a close to a year of trying not to stare holes into her chest, I was feeling what I'd fantasized about. Even over her clothes her tits were as perky and soft as I'd imagined.

""I think I do,"" she whispered, and slid so close to me I could feel the air she exhaled as she spoke. The tension hung on the backseat for a moment, before I couldn't take it any longer, and hungrily embraced Lila fully, and pulled her into a greedy, passionate kiss. Our lips locked, hers incredibly soft, and kissing me back just as hungrily as I kissed her. I began to paw at her tits without the same finesse or patience I had before, matched by her immediately dropping her hands to the zipper of my pants, undoing it and my button, and sliding her hands underneath my underwear.

The sounds of our kissing and groping filled the car, until I heard a sigh and moan come from the front, and I opened my eyes to see Rachel trying to get a glance at what was happening in the back seat.

""Uh uh little slut, eyes forward,"" I said. ""And take the long way back to your place too. I want to have a little more time like this.""

""Yes sir,"" Rachel obediently replied, in the breathy voice I'd come to know meant she was

really

turned on.

Lila and I continued to passionately make out, tongues intertwined, hands slipping underclothes, getting to know each other's bodies in the back seat of her best friend's car, while we were driven around. I slipped a hand underneath her underwear and felt a soft, well-maintained bush, brushed against her clit eliciting a soft moan, and ran my finger down the entrance to her pussy, feeling that Lila was already very wet from the flirting and making out. I pulled out of yet another deep kiss and put my lips right next to her ear.

""I love how wet you are,"" I whispered softly. ""I can tell you're going to be a good girl for me tonight. Now let's start putting that pretty face of yours to good use, what do you think? I'll make you feel good while you do, too."" Before I pulled away to make eye contact once again.

Lila didn't respond verbally, but smiled widely and nodded. I slipped my hand back up to her clit, and began to softly rub it as she fished my rock hard cock out of my pants for good, and began to move her face and mouth towards it.

Her soft lips engulfed the head of my rock hard dick first with some light kisses and licks, before slowly working her way further and further down. Taking more and more of me into her mouth and throat. Lila was not afraid of using a lot of spit too. I moaned softly and grunted in pleasure.

""Goooood girl,"" I exhaled, ""you are quite talented. Your friend is quite the little blowjob artist,"" I said for Rachel's benefit. ""Maybe I'll let you see once we're back at your place."" I heard an exhale of approval and arousal from the front. ""Or maybe I won't."" I said with a laugh.

Lila continued to work on my dick using a free hand to stroke me as her mouth came up off my dick. A truly impressive display or oral prowess. I continued to rub her clit to help encourage her, and would whisper ""good girl"" to her as I did, just loud enough for Rachel to hear in the front. Using my free hand, I grabbed a fistful of Lila's dirty blonde hair and began to guide her head up and down on my cock and set the pace, while she continued to use a hand to stroke me. We adjusted positions at this point, eventually with her bending over on the back seats, her ass pointed directly out the window if anyone could see through the tint, and both my hands in her hair, setting the pace. I pushed her further and further on my dick, until she was drooling and gagging all over me, taking all of cock down her throat.

""Ahhh that's a good little whore. I'm gonna take such good care of you tonight. I'm gonna ruin your pretty little holes in front of your best friend if you keep making me feel that good,"" I sighed happily.

I continued to fuck her face, mostly gently, for the rest of the ride home. The sounds of Lila sucking and gagging and spitting even more to keep me nice and lubricated filled the car for the last ten minutes of the drive. My hands stayed in her hair for the majority, although I took plenty of breaks to pull her tits out of her dress and massaged them hungrily. They were just perfect.

I bet Rachel will look great licking up my cum of these tits

I thought to myself.

I realized Rachel had parked, and we were outside her house. I kept using Lila's throat. She hadn't seemed to notice, and Rachel was well trained enough to know that I knew what I was doing, and would tell her when I was ready to go inside. So for the next several minutes, I locked eyes with Rachel in the rearview mirror, and allowed her to watch her best friend gag and slobber all over my dick.

Her eyes were hungrier than I'd ever seen them before. She stared at me with a nearly rabid desire in her eyes, to be included, to have a turn tasting me, to shove Lila off and keep my dick all for herself. I could see each and every one of those thoughts pass through her head. And each time they did, I'd smile even wider at Rachel, grope Lila's tits even more, give her nipple a little squeeze, then push her head town for even harder and even longer than the last time. And the only reaction Rachel gave the entire time, as the ever so slight rubbing of legs together, desperately trying to feel some tiny ounce of pleasure.

I forced Lila's head down all the way to the base of my cock, and held her there until she gagged on it and began tapping my leg for air. I pulled her head all the way off, and watched as she gasped for air to recover, spit dripping out of her mouth and off her chin, and pulled her in for a deep kiss.

""We're going inside."" I said. ""Rachel, bring my pants and underwear in, they're on the floor in the back here. Give me your keys so I can get inside."" Rachel quickly snapped to attention and tossed me her keys, opened the door, got out and came around to the back to open the door for Lila and I. Lila began to put her tits back into her dress, and I stopped her. ""Keep those out for me you little slut. We're just going to the front door, no one is going to see you."" Lila nodded dutifully.

I hopped out of the car, bottomless and with my cock rock hard, and dragged Lila by the tits behind me as Rachel looked in the back for my clothes. We beat her to the door by a mile, even in our undressed states. The perfect timing to enact my plan.

Rachel was still in the car grabbing my clothes like the obedient cuckquean she was by the time I stuck her key into the door and unlocked it. I led Lila inside into the entryway. Closed the door. Locked it again. Immediately pressed Lila up against the locked door, and slid my hand up her dress, and slipped two fingers into her tight, wet pussy as she moaned, and began kissing her neck and tits.

I heard the door handle turn, held in place from opening by the lock, followed by a knock. I continued fingering Lila, pushing as deep as I could into her and biting her tits as I did hoping to leave some marks for tomorrow. After some more insistent knocking I relented. I pulled my fingers out of Lila, and let her taste herself off them, before pulling her out from behind the door, and right into the long slim window next to the door, right in front of Rachel, who was peeking in trying to see where we'd gone.

I hiked up Lila's dress, pulled her hair so she was looking up into Rachel's eyes, and slid my dick into her pussy from behind, and began fucking her inside Rachel's house, while she was locked outside.

The long wait and foreplay in the car, and the thrill of having successfully locked my sweet cuckquean out of her own house while I fucked her friend was too much to maintain any sort of control. I thrust as hard and as fast as I could into Lila immediately. I was sure Rachel could hear the slapping of our skin even outside, and she could definitely hear how hard I'd periodically smack Lila's ass to the, and the incredibly loud moan that would follow.

""Ooohhhh FUCK!"" Lila moaned, as I continued to relentlessly pound her and spank her.

""How does Rachel look out there, having to watch us fuck in her house? Isn't she a pathetic little slut?""

""Yes she issssss"" Lila gasped out. ""This is my dick now, not hers!""

""Make sure you tell her that to her face when she comes inside I laughed, and smacked her ass again.

""Fuck baby that feels so fucking gooooooood."" As I continued to fuck Lila, I noticed Rachel rubbing herself on the outside of her her jeans. She looked at me, longing filling her eyes, and I nodded, ever so slightly, giving her permission. She undid her buttons and shoved her hand down her pussy immediately.

I laughed at the sight, and said, ""Look Lila, look at the pathetic bitch touch herself outside to us fucking,"" with another teasing laugh.

""That's so fucking hot holy shit,"" Lila said.

""I'm glad you think so, but it's nothing compared to me cumming inside and making her watch it leak out from out there.""

""Oh my goddd fuckkk that's getting me so close baby?""

""Yeah? You want me to fill you up and make Rachel watch? Make her watch it drip out onto the floor of her own home?""

""Ohhhhhh yes that's it that's so hot, keep talking and keep pounding my fucking pussy I'm so fucking closeeeee.""

""And after she's rubbed herself to the sight of my creampie, maybe we'll let her in to eat out of you.""

""Oh oh oh OOHHHHH YES."" Lila screamed, her legs shaking, her pussy clenching, and whole body throbbing as the waves of pleasure came over her. Rachel was furiously rubbing herself outside in the cold, and the sight of that and increase in pressure thanks to Lila's own orgasm sent me over the edge.

""Ohh fuck yesssss,"" I grunted, ""take that creampie baby,"" exhaling as I shot spurts of hot cum deep inside Lila's pussy, leaning down and nearly collapsing onto her back, still inside.

Rachel, for her part, continued to rub herself outside, watching us lean against the window and recover. Eventually I slid myself out of Lila.

""Turn around and spread your pussy for Rachel to see,"" I said to her. She obeyed, and Rachel was treated to the beautiful view of my cum leaking out of her best friend's pussy. She was frantically rubbing herself now, with a desperation I recognized. She was close too. I held up one hand with all five fingers outstretched, and began to count down.",,2025-08-15T19:18:55.168941,3784,
https://www.literotica.com/s/my-wife-the-quean-background,My Wife the Quean: Background,Unknown Author,,,,,"My wife and I have been married for ten years and I have been controlling her orgasms for most of that time. Before she was a submissive cuckquean, she was a chronic masturbator. On various occasions, I would come home from work and find her furiously rubbing her clit with her legs spread on the bed, while she looked at me and grinned sheepishly. I would feel the bed shaking while she fingered her pussy at night while she thought I was asleep. I also see her in the shower soaping her pussy and rubbing herself pleasurably from the mirror reflection. I knew I was married to a very, very horny girl. So when she told me about her cuckquean fantasies, I knew that controlling her ability to touch her clit would also allow me to control her.

***

I bought her a steel chastity belt for one of our anniversaries. She was so excited- but shy, even after all these years of me knowing of her humiliation fetish. I commanded ""Take your pants off. Panties and all."" She complied. Her pussy was red and dripping wet. I smirked. ""Look at that."" She smiled and looked at me eagerly then darted her eyes to my cock. ""Look away from my cock, slut.""

""Yes sir."" she mumbled.

""Lay on the floor.""

She lowered herself down and once her ass touched the ground she began gyrating from how horny and eager she was. I laughed out loud. ""What a horny bitch you are! Your pussy is dripping wet. You are making a mess. Bad girl.""

The verbal humiliation is making her even more horny; her pussy was creamed and I barely even touched it yet. ""Do I need to take pictures and send it to every girl I know? So they know how horny I keep you?"" I laughed. I know this gets her off. She wasn't just turned on by being denied, she was turned on by me threatening to fuck other girls. Her labia was completely swollen and her crotch was so heavily creamed (no pun intended). She was so horny she was literally humping the air at this point. I laughed at how pathetic it was but I was pretty turned on I could make my wife squirm like that.

""Please touch my pussy, sir."" She begged, quietly, scared of overstepping her boundaries.

I laughed and ran my fingers on her clit, then up her torso. She gasped and shuddered, closing her eyes and enjoying my fingers pleasuring her.

My two fingers landed on her clit and started to make circular motions. She began whimpering. ""Don't stop, please, sir"" she gasped. ""It feels too good."" She was squirming on the floor from how much she wanted to cum.

""I'M GOING TO CUM"" she screamed and gyrated her hips harder, her legs flailing from the pleasure and excitement. I took my fingers off her completely while she whined ""please don't stop, sir, please...""

I got up and looked at her.

""Did you have an accident and came?"" I asked smiling, knowing that she didn't.

""No sir.""

""Good girl. Now go stand in the kitchen. It's clean up time."" I commanded.

She did what she was told and stood in the middle of the kitchen, facing the sink, looking horny and defeated. I followed her, grabbing a kitchen towel. I ran hot water on it, drenching the towel, then squeezing the water out.

I walked towards my horny sub wife and her dripping pussy. I laugh ""Your pussy is literally drenched. You're dripping down your legs.""

She let out a small gasp. I knew she was horny beyond words, but this was just the beginning. There was more to do that day and I couldn't let her cum now. Plus, I enjoyed seeing her this way. I love the desperation and the obedience that follows the desperation. As long was she was horny, I could tell her what to do.

I proceeded to wipe her crotch clean with a warm towel before I put on the steel chastity belt. ""No, no, please, sir, no..."" my wife was whimpering and pleading with her eyes. ""PLEASE SIR""

click.

I locked her belt in place. She was so frustrated she was almost in tears at this point. And probably from the swelling in her clit and labia. Knowing her, she must have been so horny her pussy hurts and aches.

""I have the key on me at all times."" I said, grinning. I looked at my frustrated sub wife and the longing in her eyes. My cock was hard as rock at this point.

""Suck my cock."" She hurried on her knees and swallowed my entire shaft in her mouth. She was drooling from being so horny. She buckled her hips back and forth while on her knees, grinding against the belt trying to stimulate her throbbing pussy.

""Do you want me to let you out tonight, cunt?""

""Yes sir"" she moaned, muffled on my dick.

""Come worship my feet- and give me a massage.""

""Yes sir"" I sat down on our bed- the bed on which I torment her pussy every night. The bed where I restrain her in chains and deny her cum. There she was massaging my feet with her tiny hands and kissing my toes gently. What a good sub, I thought to myself as I made myself comfortable. I closed my eyes and fell asleep as my sub wife continued massaging me. Then she got up and cleaned our apartment completely naked except for the chastity belt so it was obvious that her horny pussy fluids were running down her bare legs.

***

I woke up and my wife was cooking dinner- I walked up to her and kissed her. She had an apron on, but nothing else except the chastity belt.

""I was thinking about the rules for the belt,"" I told her.

She looked at me, her eyes wide. She has been waiting for this moment for a long time. It has always been a fantasy of hers to be locked in a cage, denied of any relief.

My wife is the rebellious type. She acts like she doesn't like rules and breaks them all the time. But when I make them, it makes her knees buckle.

""You will be in the belt for most of the time. Especially while I am not at home. I will have the keys on me, so you can't touch your pussy. The goal is to train you. You will not be able to touch your clit or rub your pussy without my supervision. I am here to control your orgasms. This means that most of the time, I will let you out of the belt but I will ruin your orgasm. You must thank me for your orgasm even though there was no penetration or pleasure when you have them. When you are in the shower, you are still not allowed to touch your pussy. You will let me know so I can reach my hands into the shower and rub your pussy with my hands. YOU are not allowed to touch YOUR OWN pussy.""

My wife looked at me with her mouth gaping. She was so turned on at this point. I saw her lips quiver from how horny she is and how much she wanted my cock.

""Look at you being turned on at this, you sick horny slut."" I laughed. She smiled at me, moving towards me. I wrapped her in my arms and kissed her gently on her lips.

""I am going to take you out of your belt twice a day to clean you. I am going to rub you clean with a warm cloth.""

""mmmm"" she says smiling, being turned on and being seductive.

""Every night, I am going to take you out of the chastity belt.""

""you are?"" she says.

""Yes, I am going to tease your pussy so it's soaking wet. Then I am going to lock you back up. You can go to bed horny every single night. Except for when you get a ruined orgasm. But you would still be going to bed horny. So it's kind of like the same thing, I guess.""

She looked at me, completely turned on by this. I knew she would be. I read her internet history. I know what she's into and how much of a submissive cuckquean wife she wants to be.

""Are you dripping from this?"" I looked at her.

She blushed. I reached down, feeling her legs. ""Holy shit, your legs are wet. You are a messy girl."" I grinned as I watched her pleading look. The look that says please fuck me, but I am so turned on by this.

""I need to go back to cooking dinner"" My wife says in a joking manner. It meant, I am going to cook dinner if you don't fuck me right now. So I decided to maintain her desperation.

""Go ahead"" I said. I sat back and watched her cook and thought about what I was going to do to her tonight.",,2025-08-15T19:19:01.604873,1521,
https://www.literotica.com/s/ice-queen-cuckcake-pt-01,Ice Queen Cuckcake Pt. 01,Unknown Author,,,,,"""I'm sorry..."" Juan said, her throat suddenly dry. ""I'm just having a...very scatterbrained day. What did you umm, say your name was again?""

The woman in the interviewee chair raised an eyebrow and Juan had to struggle not to wither beneath her gaze. At 4-foot 10, Juan had been shorter than the average woman, even back in Singapore. But Joanna had towered over her, particularly atop her six-inch, pure white heels. Juan had been forced to deal with a lot of women in her career looking down their nose at her. A lot of Karens who saw Juan's heritage as a weakness.

You are in charge, she reminded herself, as she often had to. You are smart, you are powerful, you are confident. She should be scared of you.

But the woman didn't look scared. She looked pissed off that Juan was wasting her time. Slowly, she folded one smooth leg over the other and Juan's gaze was drawn to the intricate musculature of her leg. She wasn't just tall and beautiful. She was strong, the kind of strong that Juan, despite her weekly gym sessions, never would be.

""Joanna."" She said, her thickly accented voice sharp with disdain. Juan realized she was staring at the woman's leg and blushed heavily as she looked away. She glanced at Joanna's face to see if she'd noticed Juan's leering fascination, and she was met with two of the most piercing blue eyes she'd ever seen.

They were just like Juan's husband's eyes, overpoweringly bright. But they were full of judgment.

""Yes! Well, wecome to Zoni, Joanna."" Juan jerked her eyes back down to the papers on her desk and fumbled with them trying to find the appropriate resume.

Joanna remained silent.

""Do you uh, have any experience in the tech world?""

""I worked for Google for seven years."" Joanna said, inspecting her pure white nails.

""Oh! Oh, wow! Umm, why did you leave, if you don't mind my asking?"" Juan said as she finally found the paper already containing all this information.

""I did not agree with the politics of my boss."" Joanna said, meeting Juan's gaze again with unexpected intensity. ""My grandfather did not fight the Red Army so I could work for some neo-Marxist moron.""

""Ah. Ha-ha. Well, you won't have to worry about that here. No one here is uh...super political."" Juan said, quickly glancing over the resume.

""I will not be needing to know all about technology though, to be executive assistant, will I?"" Joanna asked.

""What? Oh, no, well, I mean...you might need to know a little about the company catalogue..."" Juan said.

""Will it be a man?""

Juan paused. ""E-excuse me?""

""Will it be a man that I will be interviewing for the position of? Will I be the secretary of a man?""

Juan, who thought she'd made it clear she was the supervisor in the position Joanna was interviewing for, contemplated briefly how to address this question.

""I only ask because when I have worked as a secretary in the past, the men I have worked for have always been terribly attracted to me.""

This confession, made so bluntly, only deepened Juan's befuddlement. Of course, she had been harassed herself in the past. She was an Asian woman in a male dominated field. Although in her experience, the harassment had more often been condescending than sexual in nature. There was further confusion based on the fact that Joanna, who couldn't have been more than 30, was speaking as with the air of experience. How many jobs had she had? How many had she been ""forced"" to leave?

How many, if any, men had fallen for her?

""I know that sounds conceited, but it is true. Men, all kinds, young men, old men, white, black, Asians...they all want me...and they want me to love them.""

Juan swallowed hard.

""I don't mind the gifts, the compliments, the promotions...but things always end up badly. As I'm sure you know, men do stupid things when they are thinking with their dicks."" Joanna said. ""I had to leave a very lucrative position at a jewelry store because the owner wanted to break up with his wife to be with me.""

""I'm the man!"" Juan blurted, then blushed. ""I mean, you-you'd be working for me, Joanna. Also, you wouldn't be a secretary, you'd be my executive assistant.""

Joanna raised an eyebrow again. Then she smiled. ""Well, I can see that you will need a very competent executive assistant, Miss...?""

""Hannola. It-it's on my door..."" Juan pointed toward the words frosted on the glass of the door behind Joanna. Joanna didn't move a muscle. ""And the form you filled out...""

""Hannola. That's a Finnish name, isn't it?""

""Yes, my husband's family was originally from that area."" Juan admitted, as her fingers subconsciously moved to the ring on her finger. It was small and elegant just like her, a tiny diamond surrounded by silver.

""Ah. Well, you are a very lucky woman indeed to have a Finnish husband, Miss Hannola. Finnish men...as I'm sure you already know; they have the will to treat a woman right."" Joanna said, with unabashed sensuality. ""It has been such a long time since I was back home. So long since I've had the company of a good Finn.""

Juan paled. ""Thank you for your time, but...I have to prepare for the next interview.""

""Yes, I can see that. You seem so busy."" Joanna said, standing up. ""You're very accomplished Miss Hannola. You must be very smart and a very hard worker to have attained this position. It would be inspiriting...but you look so tired.""

""Excuse me?""

""If you want me to be your secretary you are going to have to get used to my bluntness. This entire interview has been a complete disaster. You're obviously overworked, fatigued, confused by your own questions. You'll need a very hard worker, someone detail oriented and determined so that you don't embarrass yourself any further...""

Juan stumbled, then finally, too late, regained some semblance of dignity. ""You can leave now, Joanna.""

Instead of exiting through the door Joanna stomped over to the desk. Juan stared up at her suddenly afraid what this very large and highly unpredictable woman was about to do. ""I mean look around...your desk is a mess! This office looks like a hoarder's nest...and look at your dress..."" Joanna reached over, pinching the collar of Juan's pantsuit. ""If I was your secretary, I would never allow you to leave the house like this. You look so drab, so boring! A woman should never dress like a man if she wants to make him respect her. She must know her strengths and play to them. If your husband does not want to see you in this outfit, then your boss won't either.""

Juan stood up, slapping Joanna's hand from her collar. ""Insulting me is not going to get you this job!""

Joanna's expression darkened. Not at Juan's words, she seemed as utterly disinterested with what Juan had to say as she was unimpressed by Juan's outfit and demeanor. No, it was the little show of violence, the harmless slap which had gotten her attention.

Then she leaned over the desk, so tall that Juan had to sit back down to avoid being knocked over. Juan cringed as she felt Joanna's breath, hot and fishy crinkling her nose.

""I do not pretend to be something I am not, Miss Hannola. I will not give you false flattery so that you hire me. At the moment you are a disgrace to this company and to your position. You need someone powerful and self-assured to straighten you out. Someone who will put you back on track, who will not allow you to indulge your childishness."" She leaned close so that their lips were almost touching. ""You need me more than I need you.""

With that she turned away, marching out of the office without another look back.

***

Juan tried not to think about the woman. She was, obviously, some kind of psycho, probably with a superiority complex. And paranoid. Thinking that every man in the world was enchanted by her. Classic spoiled white bitch. Thought the world should be served to on a silver platter.

And that speech she gave about Juan failing in her job. That was the true mark of narcissism. How conceited did you have to be to think you could bully your way into a position. She never would have tried that if Juan had been white. Or taller.

Luckily, the rest of the interviews were much more boring. There was one obvious contender who stood out above the others. Juan's old college friend, Isabel, was leaps and bounds above the others in terms of experience. Plus, Juan wouldn't have to worry about her trying to supersede her.

After a long day at work and a wonderful dinner with her husband, Mark, she'd almost put the strange woman and the terrible interview out of her mind. But as she and Mark retired to the bedroom, and things were beginning to get hot and heavy, Joanna's words returned to her.

Juan had always considered herself lucky to be able to bag Mark. Like, Joanna, he had those Scandinavian genes that made him tower over her. Like her, he was incredibly fit, sculpted such that Juan always felt soft and pudgy when she compared herself to him. Unlike Joanna, Mark had dark hair and dark eyes, which only stood out more against his pale skin and which rendered him so handsome and intimidating that she never would have had the courage to make a move on him.

He'd been her personal trainer, and the daily exercises he'd put her through had taken on a suggestive edge, eventually culminating in him kissing her. It had been a particularly sweaty session and it only got more intense when mid-make out she'd begun to strip, in a hurried attempt to make up for lost time. She'd always been intrigued by the bulge in his sweat shorts, but that day she'd discovered just how out classed she was. She hadn't been as sexually experienced as he was, but even in the porn she'd indulged in on particularly stressful nights, she hadn't seen an organ like his, let alone had anything of comparable size inside her.

She'd quickly switched gears to a blowjob when she'd seen it. Not a deep throating, which she wasn't sure was physically possible. More like a little sloppy kiss to his glans, accompanied by a two-handed hand-job, with the occasional ball fondling and dick nuzzling. He was to her, from that moment forward, not just a commanding, dominant male that she could safely submit to, but a sexual deity worthy of worship. Her inability to take him entirely in her mouth or her cunt, had only deepened her determination to please him.

Since then, they'd experimented with all different kinds of love-making. She'd practiced with various dildos to try to open herself up better for him. But she'd still remained unable to get his entire length inside her. Or brave enough to even attempt his long-held fantasy of anal. He'd told her many times, usually after he'd finished bringing her to shrieking climax with his devilish tongue, that he couldn't ask for more. That he loved her tight little body and her cute little boobies as much as he loved her brain and her big heart. That any sexual incompatibility she might be insecure about was imagined, conjured by social expectation.

Still, it gnawed at her. It gnawed at her when she saw him training hot young models or voluptuous housewives. It gnawed at her when she took him to the Christmas party and the other women at the office flocked to grab his attention and asked her how she'd managed to get him under her thumb. Even worse was when she was with her family. Her mother always complained that she wasn't ""good enough"" to him. She'd wanted her to be a homemaker, and she considered Juan's entire career as a bit of selfish rebellion. As far as she was concerned, Juan should spend all day cooking and cleaning, and waiting by the door to blow Mark as soon as he came in.

Her two sisters were dating white guys too, but their relationships were far more heteronormative. They told her it was a big thing with Asian-American girls their age, a kind of forbidden fruit ripe with erotic possibilities. They followed in their mother's footsteps in criticizing the way that she ""took care of her man."" She didn't like it either how they, who despite being her junior, were both taller than she was, loved to press their bodies to his every holiday, as if inviting him to have a feel.

That night though, she wasn't imagining him pressing himself to tighter, slimmer Asian girls. She was imagining him with Joanna, their big, gorgeous European bodies fitting together like two puzzle pieces. Joanna would turn back to Juan, who sat in the corner watching them make love and just give her a little smile that said ""I'll take care of this. You can get back to work.""

The terrifying vision was only compounded by the thrill inherent to it. Juan had worried so often about not being enough. There was some comfort in the acceptance of that came with the confirmation of those fears. The thrill thankfully vanished with her accelerated orgasm, replaced with embarrassment at the prematurity of her own orgasm.

She tried to make it up to Mark by taking his entire length, which turned out to be just as overambitious as ever. But she was able to reward him for making her come undone so quickly with a lengthy lovemaking session. And as arousal was superseded by love, her worries about Joanna disappeared. Mark loved her and she loved him. No amount of bosom or ass was going to get in the way of that. She put the worry from her mind and it hardly bothered her until a few days later, when during a lunch break, she swung by the gym to bring Mark lunch and found him in his gym clothes rolling around on the mat with Joanna.

""Oh! Hey!"" His smile couldn't have been more innocent. Did he really not think he was doing anything wrong?

Joanna on the other hand, who's skin-tight leotard left nothing to the imagination, didn't even try to hide her malevolence. As she tussled with Mark, it was completely obvious to Juan that she was letting him win. Again and again, she'd put up a cursory fight, only breaking his hold on her long enough for him to get her into a lewder position. And all the while, as she rubbed her sweaty, spandex-wrapped body all over Mark's legs, shoulders, groin...she wore that same, horrible smile that Juan had imagined she would.

It was like a waking nightmare, and like all true nightmares, Juan was too shocked by its reality to intercept its inevitable conclusion. After what seemed like hours, but what was only a few minutes, Joanna turned on Mark, lulling him into a false sense of security and then effortlessly bucking him off, climbing on top of him and pinning him to the floor with her thighs around his head.

""Surrender and I let you breathe."" She said, glancing over her shoulder and smiling down where his handsome face lay hidden by her cyan leggings.

Mark struggled for a moment. Then he slapped first the mat and then the outside of her toned thigh in increasing desperation. Joanna opened her legs slowly, teasing him with his first gasp of air and grinning hideously as he inhaled her humid aroma of her juicy, camel toed twat. Juan felt her stomach somehow sink lower in her at the sight. It was wretched enough, the idea that Joanna's size and imperturbability made her Juan's superior. But seeing her demonstrate her dominance over Juan's husband as well, somehow more deeply crippled Juan's already crumbling confidence. It was like both her and Mark, as well as their marriage lay prone in Joanna's meaty hands, a baby bird with a broken wing.

""Your husband is a quite the wrestler."" Joanna said, dragging her core down Mark's washboard abs as she slid off him and pausing, almost imperceptibly, just above the belt line. ""He must keep you quite fit."" She said, casting another smirk of sacrilegious sarcasm in Juan's direction.

Juan fumed. She wanted to launch herself at the bitch. To rip out her hair and claw at her eyes and kick her in the cunt and make her promise never to touch her man again.

Instead, she stood at the edge of the mat, staring at Joanna's perfect ass sway in those eye-attracting sweatpants. There was no point in violence. Juan might get one or two kicks in thanks to the element of surprise. But Joanna could fold every bone in her body without breaking a sweat. Not to mention Mark would jump in to drag her off her.

Then Joanna would be able to take Juan to court for assault and Juan, a wife afraid of her husband's infidelity, would lose. The scenario played out in Juan's head with terrible vividness. Joanna lounging on Juan's king-sized bed while she spent the night in a cold cell.

Joanna sitting atop Mark's perfect face and grinding her sweat-soaked cunt across his chiseled face as she petted his hair and told him ""Don't worry, I'll keep you company until she gets out.""

Of course that would never happen. Firstly, because Juan had enough money and good enough lawyers that the worst, she'd probably get was house-arrest. But secondly and more importantly, because she knew, deep down, that Mark would never betray her by allowing himself to become the scratching board for this licentious lioness.

Probably.

""I didn't know you knew my wife..."" Mark said, suddenly confused and very nervous.

Had they been fooling around even more before she arrived? Had they just been flirting? Or had it been more sinister? Had he been thinking about her, admiring her form, imagining what she was like in the sack? Had he leapt at the opportunity to roll around with her when she inevitably suggested it?

Juan knew that Mark finding Joanna attractive shouldn't be worse than him flirting with her. But it was...somehow. It was because Joanna was objectively attractive, the kind of woman that some men would lavish fortunes on, in exchange for a brief smile or a blown kiss. But the idea of him liking her, of him liking her for something other than her body, that was emotional infidelity and it was far more stomach churning than anything physical he could do, because it meant that it wasn't just her body she should feel inadequate about.

""I interviewed to be her secretary."" Joanna said, leaning down to take her things off the bench by the wall and shaking her massive ass as she did so. Was she showing off for Mark? Or for Juan? She'd known Juan's last name, known his last name was Finnish. There couldn't be many ""Mr. Hannola""s in this city. She must have tracked him down to seduce him, as some kind of bizarre retribution for Juan dismissing her.

And yet...Mark wasn't looking in Joanna's direction as she shook that enormous, remarkably sculpted caboose. He was staring at Juan. Juan was staring in Joanna's direction and, judging from the secret smile that Joanna cast her way as she straightened up, picking up her water bottle and tossing the towel over her shoulder, she knew it.

Juan was suddenly just as confused as her husband was. And judging from the unmistakable tenting of his shorts that Joanna's ripe pussy must have elicited, just as aroused. Juan had never considered herself bisexual. She had admired the bodies of other women of course, but that was something that all women did, wasn't it? She'd never had the urge to feel the weight of another woman's tit in her hand or to plunge her tongue into another woman's canal. But there was something irresistibly seductive about Joanna that made Juan question everything. She didn't want to shove her little nose up that tight ass crack and inhale Joanna's natural musk. But she wondered what it might be like. She didn't want to see Joanna riding Mark until he forgot her name and painted her womb with Scandinavian sperm.

But she wondered what it might be like.

""Oh...uh, well, I guess I can skip introductions then."" Mark said, finally getting up and trying and failing to hide his obvious hard-on as he hurried over to Juan. ""She uh...booked me for half the day. We went through all the usual stuff and then she uh...asked if I knew how to wrestle.""

Juan just stared at him. Did he expected her to just believe that their sexually charged duel had started out naively? How stupid did he think she was?",,2025-08-15T19:19:06.609658,3506,
https://www.literotica.com/s/girlpup,Girlpup,Unknown Author,,,,,"Now that it's over, the whole thing is hard to believe, but it made sense at the time. Even now I miss him ... I miss Eliot. I hope he's happy. I think I could have stayed with him a long time but it didn't work for him. We met at a WeWork in downtown Seattle. I was trying to do some freelance writing. We occupied adjacent cubicles. I don't know which of us got there first, but we noticed each other and when I took a break to get coffee I offered to bring him some. He said, ""Um, sure...black, no sugar. Thanks."" He thanked me again when I set the coffee next to his laptop. Later, he asked me to watch his stuff for a few minutes while he took a call. You weren't supposed to do calls in the open.

The next day he was there again, though we weren't next to one another. We waved and smiled. I brought him coffee again and he introduced himself, Eliot Seaman. ""I'm Maddie,"" I replied. He was handsome, mid-thirties, wavy brown hair, expensive but casual clothes, dark eyes, a two-day stubble just like I love... but he struck me as unhappy. Preoccupied, distracted, maybe resentful -- of whom? Colleagues? Customers? I started watching him, trying to figure him out. I looked for him every day, hoping to park myself nearby, which was usually possible. We had a friendly thing going -- whoever was going for coffee would get it for both of us. Still, we didn't talk a whole lot; we were supposed to be working.

In the second week of our WeWork encounters he asked if I could watch his stuff while he ran home to take his dog out; he wouldn't be long, he promised. I said sure -- I wasn't going anywhere. When he got back he showed me Instagram photos of himself and the dog, a golden retriever. They were cute. I was starting to like him. He explained that he usually worked at home but his kitchen was being redone, it was too noisy to work there and Winnie, the dog, needed more than he could ask the workmen for. He was hoping they'd be done and gone in another week. To me, that meant Eliot might be gone in a week.

The next day he seemed hassled -- he kept disappearing for phone calls. When he asked me again to watch his stuff while he went to Winnie I said, ""Hey, why don't I go? I'm just waiting around for emails that never arrive. Give me your address, I'll take Winnie out. You can stay and work.""

I could tell he wanted to say yes. ""You're sure?"" he asked.

""Sure."" I wanted to help. I wanted to meet Winnie. Mostly, I wanted to see where Eliot lived and make a connection before his kitchen was done and he disappeared for good. He must have been desperate because he gave me his address, the keycode to his garage, and instructions for Winnie. He said he would text the workmen that I was coming. I felt butterflies.

Winnie was totally cool. She didn't know me but was eager to accept her leash and to romp in the park Eliot directed me to. When I brought her back to the house I walked to the kitchen to tell the workmen we were back; it gave me a chance to snoop a little. I guess I was looking for signs of a girlfriend. There weren't any, but the house was impressive -- Eliot clearly worked in tech.

I insisted on walking Winnie again the following day and it became a routine. I tended to Eliot's dog while he worked. I was bummed when he informed me at the end of the week that the kitchen was done at last and he would be working from home from now on. It implied he didn't need me. Worse, he thanked me in a way that felt final, like I wouldn't see him again. I congratulated him on the kitchen.

For two days I tried to figure out why I was obsessing about Eliot. Part of it was that I had been dumped by a guy a few months before who basically told me I was too focused on me and not enough on 'us' (but he meant not enough on him). He was being an asshole, but his comment bugged me. I wanted to prove him wrong. I wanted to show that I

could

focus on someone else and be some kind of model girlfriend. Eliot was perfect because I liked him and he was unhappy. I could make him happy. I would make that my job, like nothing else mattered.

So the next day I went to his house at dog-walking time with a leash from Petsmart and a coffee from Peet's. When he answered the door I said, ""Hey! I'm here for Winnie's walk!"" and handed him the coffee. ""Black, no sugar, right?"" The great thing was that he laughed and waved me into the house, and Winnie practically knocked me over. I felt like a dating genius (go for the guy's dog). And then he said exactly what I had been hoping for, why don't we all go for a walk: me, him, and Winnie. But just then I had another flash of brilliance: I said no. ""No, you need to work. Let me do this. Winnie and I will be fine. You do your thing.""

I was a little surprised that he agreed -- I guess he really did need to work -- so Winnie and I set out for the park. As we walked, I thought about how to play it. Had we gone together, it would have turned into some kind of dating thing between me and Eliot and we'd have to navigate that. This was better: it was just me doing something thoughtful for him. Therefore I should walk Winnie, bring her back, and then excuse myself -- cheerfully disappear and make it clear I expected nothing in return. Just Maddie being helpful.

It worked. Eliot invited me in again but I said, ""Oh, no. I'll get out of your hair."" I escorted him back to the sofa where he'd been doing whatever he was doing. The laptop was there, and a tablet, his phone, a half-eaten bagel, and the empty coffee cup. I playfully herded him to his seat, then turned to leave but stopped when I noticed Winnie. The dog approached Eliot as soon as he sat, poked him with her muzzle and licked his hand, waited for a pat, a fond if perfunctory stroking of her head and behind her ears. Then, understanding that her master was occupied, Winnie settled herself at his feet with her back against his leg. ""Good girl,"" he murmured. I realized two things. One, I wanted that closeness. Two, Winnie didn't ask for much; pats and scratches, sure, and she loved Eliot's attention, but she was content with whatever he gave her and then was just standing by for him. Wow. Winnie could teach me how to be with Eliot.

The next day when I brought Winnie back I asked for a tour of the new kitchen. It was still not unpacked and sort of a mess with boxes all over, nothing put away. Eliot kept apologizing for its condition but also wanted to show it off. He started telling me about features. I stopped him when he got to the espresso maker, a built-in fully plumbed smart machine. ""But you haven't even used it!"" I chided him.

""Well, not yet...""

I demanded the manual -- I'd already found coffee beans -- and nudged him out. ""I'm very good at this. You go on and I'll figure it out."" Fifteen minutes later I brought him a perfect Americano, then returned to the kitchen to unpack boxes and start organizing. I couldn't do it all, but I made a decent dent before returning to Eliot. Winnie rose to greet me, licked my hand, then returned to settle at his feet. I screwed up my courage and did the same thing. I said something like, ""Oh, Winnie looks so comfortable,"" and sank to the floor with my legs under me and snuggled against Eliot. You could say he was surprised.

He laughed uncomfortably and asked, ""Um, what are you doing?""

""Just waiting til you have a minute to look at the kitchen. You need to tell me where you want certain things. But I can wait.""

He gave me an eyeroll and said, ""Sorry, Maddie, but I have a girlfriend.""

""Is that so?"" I asked innocently. ""That's great. I hope she's good to you. What's her name?""

""June.""

""Because if she ever hurts you I'm going to be very upset,"" I warned, looking up from his knee.

He raised an eyebrow and said, ""I don't think she'd be too happy to find another woman walking my dog, making me coffee, unpacking my kitchen, and sitting at my feet.""

I responded simply. ""Why not? I'm just trying to be helpful. Does June walk Winnie or make you coffee?""

""June?"" He laughed. ""Hell, no, she's too busy.""

""Well, then she shouldn't complain. I just want you to be happy. Doesn't she want the same thing?""

He shot me a cynical, mischievous look. ""You want me to be happy? What if I asked you to take off your shirt?""

I pulled it off in a flash before he could stop me. I sat there in my bra, spread my arms to show off, and gave him a happy smile. It wasn't fake. I was thrilled.

Eliot was flustered. ""Jesus, Maddie! I was kidding. I mean, I didn't think you'd do it! Put your shirt on.""

""Whatever you say, sir."" But before I put it on, I unhooked my bra, slid it off and folded it. I handed it to him primly then took my sweet time replacing the shirt to make sure he got a good view. He fingered the bra as he watched me. I knew it was warm and smelled good. ""So let me know when you have a minute to check out the kitchen,"" I said, and curled back into his leg, now pressing my breast against him.

After that I never wore a bra at Eliot's and I wore tops that made it obvious. I wanted him to know my tits were his if he wanted them. I mean, if you want to make someone happy, share your tits. Really. What could be nicer? Boobs are wonderful, all shapes and sizes, mine included. There's no other body part like them. They're full, soft, round, warm, and totally plush -- no structure, so they jiggle and bounce. And nipples are awesome. Even if I didn't have a clit, I bet I could have an orgasm just playing with my nipples.

Eliot got the message and pretty soon, if he had a free hand when I curled up next to him (like if he wasn't typing), he would cup a boob and pet it and sometimes give a gentle squeeze. Apparently he liked tits -- great! I would encourage him with little sighs and make sure he had access. Not only were my nipples stiff, my panties were damp.

I figured the next thing was blow jobs. I never knew a man who didn't like them. I was sure this would make Eliot happy, too, but the problem was June. He was a very considerate guy and even though he was okay with feeling my tits whenever, he would probably think blow jobs crossed a line. Which they did, of course, which was why I wanted to do it. Once again I took my cue from Winnie. Whenever Eliot patted her, she leaned into it, prodding him for more. I did the same. If Eliot fondled my breast, I'd run a hand over his calf and rub my cheek on his thigh. The first time my hand wandered to his crotch, he removed it and murmured, ""No, Maddie."" And like a good girl I retreated. ""Whatever you say, sir."" He wasn't ready.

It had to be because of June. He was comfortable having me around -- by then I was there a lot -- but never when June was coming over. He might say, ""Thanks for your help, Maddie. You can go now."" One time I finally asked, ""Is June coming?""

""Yes, as a matter of fact.""

""You don't want me to see her? Or you don't want her to see me.""

He laughed. ""Very much the latter. I know you're not jealous. But I know June is, or would be if she found out who's been walking Winnie.""

He was wrong about me. I was super jealous but merely said, ""Okay. Can I come back when she's gone? I was going to fold some laundry.""

""I think tomorrow would be safer."" He patted my head like he might have Winnie's.

That told me June was going to spend the night and they were undoubtedly going to have sex. It's not like I didn't already know it -- she was his girlfriend, okay? But this time it got to me. When I left, I parked a couple of blocks away and walked back to a neighbor's hedge to watch for June.

She arrived in a silver Audi (so she's rich, I assumed) and was carrying a canvas bag big enough for overnight but also a briefcase-y looking backpack. I had only a moment to check her out before Eliot let her inside (at least she didn't have her own key). She was dark-haired (like me), medium build but not much bust, well dressed, heels, sunglasses -- that's about all I could tell. She seemed grumpy because she didn't dance up the walk eager to see her wonderful boyfriend; she sort of sauntered up while checking her phone. I imagined she was scowling. When Eliot came to the door, he pecked her cheek. When she didn't return it I thought to myself, 'Cold bitch,' and felt sorry for Eliot.

The rest of that evening, back at my place alone, I thought about Eliot and June and imagined them having sex. I pictured them naked and writhing, Eliot handsome and virile and June past her prime; Eliot wishing for oral and June too dumb or mean or prudish to give it to him. I wondered what poor Winnie did when they had sex. Then I imagined myself there at the house with Winnie. I had this sick fantasy that for the sake of Eliot's happiness I would get him ready for June even though he deserved better. She would have gone to the bedroom to wait while I undressed Eliot and folded his clothes. And neatened his hair and rubbed his body and told him how great he looked. Eventually I'd fondle his penis, getting it ready for showtime. I knew I could do it better than June. I could make Eliot harder than

she'd

ever seen him. I stroked it and then, yes, sucked it. I did it better than Eliot could have imagined; he was overwhelmed by my fellatio. In my imagination his penis was perfect, you understand -- big, but not shocking or gross. I imagined his balls covered with beautiful hair. His penis glistened and hardened, obviously for me not June. In my fantasy Eliot stroked my hair and whispered

Oh, Maddie.

But it was my duty to stop so he wouldn't ejaculate before he got to June. Faithful Maddie patted his chest. 'I think you're ready, sir.' And steered my Eliot toward the door where his undeserving paramour was waiting. He touched my cheek then went to her. In my fantasy I cried while they fucked. Is that sick?

All right, enough fantasy -- back to blow jobs. It took another week, during which I kept finding ways to make myself useful. In addition to walking Winnie and making coffee, I did whatever laundry he didn't send out, whatever errands I could think of, and started baking now and then, like bread and muffins; baking gave me another useful chore -- cleanup. When he finally allowed me to stroke him through his pants, I knew it was only a matter of time. Still, I had to make the move, which was to lower his zipper. Again he stopped me, but his heart wasn't in it. ""I don't think June would approve,"" he said.

""Oh? I just thought a blow job would make you happy. But maybe June is coming over to give you one?""

He knew where this was going. ""Not that I know of.""

""No? Well, that means you wouldn't get one. That would be a shame, wouldn't it?""

""Yes, I guess it would.""

""June wouldn't want you to be unhappy. And I'm the only one here so it's kind of up to me, isn't it?"" He surrendered to my logic and let me open his pants. I fished out his penis and began tickling it. ""Just relax, sir, and let me take care of this.""

He sighed. ""Good girl.""

It was almost as perfect as I imagined it. His dick had heft and heat that don't show up in a fantasy. This was real; it was Eliot's and I was giddy to finally have it. I had to remind myself not to get carried away, to stay focused on Eliot, to give him the best he ever had -- in a whole different category from anything June might attempt. I think I succeeded. I slurped and teased and nibbled; I licked the head like ice cream and petted his balls and stroked his thighs. He was passive at first, letting me do all the work, which I was happy to do. As he got closer to coming, his skin got damp and his breathing got heavy. He began thrusting, though not aggressively; I think he just couldn't help himself and that made me glad. I knew I couldn't deep throat him -- he was too big and I had never done it, though it occurred to me I should practice somehow in case he ever wanted it. Things had gotten sloppy by the time he was ready to come. I intended to take it all in my mouth so he would know he was welcome. That's what happened -- warm jets flooded my mouth and I swallowed everything. Mission accomplished. I licked him while he recovered. ""You see? You needed that."" I rose to fetch a warm washcloth and towel. I decided my service would include cleanup, too.

Blow jobs became a regular thing. We both looked forward to them -- they made him happy. I got better at knowing what he liked and he grew accustomed to first-rate cock sucking. When I came into the house I'd sing out, ""Does anybody here need a blow job?"" And he would laugh. Or I might look for him after finishing some chore and ask hopefully, ""Do you have time for a blow job, sir?"" Sometimes he turned me down because he had to finish something or start a meeting. ""Maybe later."" And I'd say, ""Why don't we set a time."" He'd laugh and say, ""Okay, 6:30."" ""Right. Banjo Judy at 1830."" Then I'd pull out my phone and say, ""Hey Siri, remind me to give Eliot his blow job at 6:30."" Corny, yes, but it was fun.

I wasn't sure how much June knew about me. I was pretty sure from things Eliot said that she knew he'd found a dog walker. But I was pretty sure she didn't know the dog walker was unpaid and was sucking her boyfriend off every chance she got -- tits out preferably. We laughed a lot. He never took it farther -- he never tried to get in my pants -- but I didn't mind. I was making him happy and I just knew June wasn't. It was her own fault and served her right. But then, suddenly, Eliot stopped being happy. He'd been enjoying my service so much that it was jarring to see him obviously down. ""Is everything okay?"" I asked. ""Is there anything I can do?"" I wasn't teasing him -- he was serious so I was serious.

He drew a breath. ""Maddie, what are we doing?""

""What do you mean? I thought we were having fun.""

""We are. That's the problem. You know I have a girlfriend [he didn't say her name], and yet we do all this. And you never complain when I go to her. Why is that, Maddie? Why do you do this?""

""Well ... I want you to be happy."" I was nervous because he sounded almost angry with me, frustrated at least. Like I was making him

un

happy, which was so unexpected, so opposite from my intent, that it sort of freaked me out. ""Would you be happier if I left?"" I asked. My voice was unsteady. ""I'll leave if that's what you want."" [Please don't make me leave.]

He continued to stare at me but his look softened. ""No, I know that. I love that you do things for me, Maddie. But what's in for you? It can't be just my happiness.""

Without much thought I said, ""I want to be like Winnie..."" He narrowed his eyes. I blushed and started over. ""Okay, that came out wrong ... but not totally. I want to be loyal, faithful, obedient ... dependable. If I demand anything in return, that ruins it -- then it's not a gift, it's a trade. It feels better to just give, to do things for you -- to make your coffee, do your laundry, give you orgasms. I want to give you

me

, with no strings attached."" Then I added, ""I promise you can have June, too, if that makes you happy.""

He didn't reply. On an impulse, I left for the kitchen to find Winnie's leash, the one I'd bought at Petsmart. When I came back, I made it into a loop and placed it around my neck. I pulled it snug and presented the end to Eliot. I said, ""I'm yours, sir, however you want me.""

I hoped for a smile, but didn't receive one. He inspected the leash briefly, then handed the end back to me. ""I need to think about this.""

Shit.

I left and didn't hear from him for four days. It was mid-December, cold and rainy -- the weather sucked. I was alone in my little apartment and hated it. I thought about Eliot constantly and envied Winnie. I imagined her curled at his feet in front of a fire. Lucky Winnie. In hindsight though, the break was a good thing because I needed to think, too. Eliot was asking good questions -- why was I doing this? What did I want?

I wanted Eliot, but not exactly. I wanted to

be Eliot's.

There were lots of ways to be his. I could be his princess, or his servant, his little girl, his pet, his toy. Any or all of those. It was up to him. Then I wondered what if he hurt me. Was I still his then? Or scarier, what if hurting me made him happy? I decided it wasn't okay for him to abuse me, any more than it would be okay for him to abuse Winnie. If he did, I would leave. But he wouldn't, that's the thing --

he wouldn't.

Not Eliot. Eliot was a good man even when he was unhappy. It made zero sense that being bad would make him happy. I decided I would be his devoted pet -- his Maddie, his Girlpup. If he would allow it. If he would give me a chance. If he would just call me.",,2025-08-15T19:19:11.039684,3984,
https://www.literotica.com/s/the-au-pair-and-the-cuck-quean,The Au Pair & The Cuck Quean,Unknown Author,,,,,"Chloe was the eighth potential au pair that Jennifer and her husband, Callum, had interviewed. Despite her young age and lack of experience compared to other candidates, they both felt an inexplicable connection with her, making her stand out as the best qualified and the perfect fit for their family. After a second interview a few days later, they left Chloe in the living room and moved to the kitchen to discuss privately.

""I knew you would like her best,"" Jennifer teased Callum with a playful grin.

""I have no idea what you mean,"" Callum replied, his broad smile betraying his amusement.

Jennifer chuckled, feeling a mix of excitement and concern. ""I can't believe we're actually considering having a nineteen-year-old girl, who looks like her, move into our home.""

Callum's eyes softened as he reached out to hold Jennifer's hand. ""You know I only have eyes for you, Jennifer.""

""You better,"" Jennifer quipped back, a trace of insecurity in her voice. ""But seriously, don't you think she's dressed a little inappropriately for an interview?""

Callum shrugged gently. ""She's young, French and that's how girls her age dress. We both agreed we wanted someone relatable and vibrant for the kids, not an old matron-like nanny. And I love the idea that she can also teach the children French.""

""You're right,"" Jennifer acknowledged, trying to push her worries aside. ""And if I had the same figure as hers, maybe I'd show it off too,"" she added playfully.

Callum's tender gaze locked with hers. ""Jennifer, you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen,"" he comforted her.

Jennifer's eyes softened, but a hint of self-consciousness remained. ""You have to say that Callum, and even if you think it, I don't feel beautiful anymore. You still look exactly as you did on our wedding day, and I don't. You know I am self-conscious about it.""

Callum embraced his wife, reassuring her, ""You're beautiful inside and out, Jennifer. And nothing will change that.""

As they continued their heartfelt conversation, Jennifer expressed her concerns about her latest career step, the requirement for frequent travel, and the time Callum and her children would spend with Chloe. ""You have to like her, just don't like her too much!"" she teased with a playful nudge.

Callum chuckled, pulling her close. ""You know you have nothing to worry about, but I do think the kids will like her the most.""

""Okay,"" Jennifer agreed, feeling a bit more at ease with their decision.

Callum's mischievous side emerged as he added, ""And I have some ideas for her uniform, something short and low cut.""

Jennifer playfully swatted him. ""Don't even joke about that!"" she said, her cheeks flushed.

Together, they walked back to the living room to share the good news with Chloe.

Chloe seamlessly settled into their home, quickly becoming an indispensable part of their family. Her dedication to taking care of the children went beyond their expectations. Not only did she attend to their needs, but she also effortlessly managed the household chores, preparing delicious meals and keeping everything neat and tidy. Jennifer and Callum found themselves wondering how they had ever managed without her.

The children's bond with Chloe grew stronger with each passing day. They admired her youthful energy and playful nature, making her the highlight of their days. As they watched their kids thrive under Chloe's care, Jennifer felt a glimmer of relief, realizing that their decision to hire her had been the right one.

In the serene ambiance of their new home, Chloe's presence had woven itself into the fabric of their lives. She brought a warmth and affection that the entire family relished. And yet, Jennifer couldn't escape the incessant pull of her maternal instincts, tugging at her heart with nagging worry.

With each day that passed, her concerns mounted, and she felt an inexplicable need to ensure her children's safety when she and Callum were away. In her mind, installing discreet cameras throughout the house seemed like a small sacrifice for peace of mind. ""Maybe it's just me being overly cautious,"" Jennifer explained to Callum, ""but I would feel negligent if I didn't do everything possible to ensure the children are being taken care of.""

At first, Callum was skeptical about the idea of surveillance within their own home. He felt it betrayed a lack of trust in Chloe, who had only ever shown unconditional love and care for their children. But with Jennifer's persistent persuasion, he eventually relented, hoping it would ease her worries and maintain harmony in their home.

Jennifer had concerns for the children, which she had explained to Callum. However, she was also nervous about Chloe's obvious allure and her growing closeness with Callum. Installing cameras would not only allow her to check on the children's welfare but also keep an eye on Callum and Chloe. Jennifer's self-consciousness and lack of confidence in her appearance were amplified by Chloe's youthful beauty. She noticed how Callum looked at Chloe, especially when she wore revealing clothes, which intensified her jealousy. Despite trusting Callum, Jennifer hoped the cameras would discourage any inappropriate behavior between them and give her peace of mind by monitoring the situation.

Jennifer's concerns grew one afternoon in early summer when she returned home early from work to find Callum and Chloe, frolicking in the pool with the children. Her eyes narrowed, focusing on Chloe, who was in the pool, water up to her navel, flaunting herself in an impossibly revealing string bikini that seemed to defy decency. The thin fabric of the bra clung to her like a second skin, leaving little to the imagination, especially now that it was soaked. Jennifer's stomach churned with a mixture of anger and insecurity.

Chloe's energy seemed boundless as she splashed around, and Jennifer couldn't help but notice how the tiny bikini top struggled to contain her ample breasts, barely obscuring her nipples. The pang of jealousy she felt was undeniable, as the sight of Chloe's bouncing tits twisted her insides into knots.

Jennifer grappled with a tumult of emotions as she observed Chloe's provocative attire. Deep down, she knew that part of her discomfort stemmed from an unexpected source -- herself. She had never considered herself attracted to women, but Chloe's youthful allure, infectious energy, and explicit clothing were creating an unexpected arousal and excitement within her.

It was a confounding mix of feelings, one that she struggled to reconcile with her genuine concern for her family's well-being.

Taking a deep breath, Jennifer pulled Callum aside, hoping he'd understand her perspective. ""Callum,"" she said, trying to keep her voice steady, ""I really think Chloe's choice of swimwear is inappropriate around the children and you.""

Callum raised an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed by Jennifer's concerns. ""It's just a bikini, and she's French, you're lucky she isn't topless or au naturel!"" he replied, a hint of mocking in his voice. ""Chloe's comfortable with her body, and I don't see anything wrong with that.""

Jennifer's frustration bubbled up, and she wished she could voice her true fears. It wasn't just about Chloe's bikini; it was the effect it had on Callum that worried her the most. But she held back those thoughts, not wanting to escalate the situation further.

""It's not just about being comfortable,"" Jennifer explained, trying to reason with him. ""It's about setting a proper example for the kids and being mindful of their exposure to certain things.""

Callum's dismissive tone grated on her nerves. ""You're letting jealousy cloud your judgment,"" he retorted, his words cutting deep. ""It's unattractive and childish. Why don't you put on a bikini and join us?""

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, feeling hurt and misunderstood. With a heavy heart, Jennifer watched as he returned to the pool, laughing and playing with Chloe and the children.

The warm summer afternoon cast a golden hue over the scene by the pool, but Jennifer's emotions were anything but serene. She sat on the edge of her seat, her heart pounding as she watched the au pair emerge from the water. Chloe's sun-kissed skin glistened as droplets of water cascaded down her toned figure, drawing Jennifer's attention to the bottom half of her bikini, which was as daring as the top. With only a thin string at her hips and translucent material that left little to the imagination. Even from a distance Jennifer could clearly make out the impression of Chloe's hairless vulva against the wet material, and when she turned and bent over to pick up a ball, Jennifer was shocked that the dark shadow surrounding her asshole was visible.

As much as Jennifer admired Chloe's carefree spirit, she couldn't help but feel a pang of envy and insecurity. She was too self-conscious of her own body to don a bikini like Chloe, and the contrast between them intensified her inner turmoil. But she couldn't deny that Chloe's body was breathtaking and she found herself drawn to it in a way she had never felt toward another woman. Caught between shock and arousal, Jennifer tried to make sense of her emotions, but the more she analyzed, the less clarity she found.

Lost in her thoughts, Jennifer didn't notice Callum approaching until he tapped her on the shoulder. Startled, she turned to face him, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment at the realization that he had caught her staring at Chloe who was bent over with her large breasts defying gravity and testing the strength of the tiny bikini.

""Jennifer,"" Callum said with a playful grin, ""you really shouldn't stare. It's not polite.""

""I-I'm sorry,"" Jennifer stammered, trying to regain her composure. ""It's just... I didn't mean to.""

Callum chuckled softly, his eyes warm with understanding. ""No need to apologize. I can't take my eyes off her either.""

Jennifer's insecurities were peaked by Callum's obvious attraction to Chloe and as a result, Jennifer's wavering self-confidence clouded her judgment. In a moment of vulnerability, she made a hasty decision, deciding at great expense to add extra cameras to the network without telling Callum. The new additions discreetly peered into the bedroom she shared with Callum with a second in Chloe's room.

She knew it was irrational, an unfounded fear that gripped her heart, but the possibility of something developing between Callum and Chloe while she was away traveling for work haunted her dreams. Jennifer loathed herself for entertaining such thoughts, but they refused to be silenced.

Jennifer found herself grappling with a complex mix of emotions as her mind was increasingly filled with intrusive thoughts of Callum being unfaithful with Chloe. These vivid scenarios of betrayal and humiliation left her feeling deeply emotional, even though she knew they were solely creations of her own imagination.

To her surprise, as Jennifer let her imagination run wild, the idea of Callum cheating with the alluring Chloe took on an unexpected twist. The fear of infidelity evolved into a source of arousal, stirring an exciting tension within her. It was a perplexing revelation that left her initially disconcerted, but as time went on, she embraced these thoughts as harmless fantasies, freeing herself from any guilt or inhibition.

In the private sanctuary of her mind, Jennifer allowed the fantasies to develop, becoming more elaborate and explicit. The infidelity scenarios now held an intriguing edge, not just about Callum and Chloe's enjoyment of each other, but also involving an element of thrilling humiliation for herself.

Though unconventional, Jennifer found liberation in exploring these thoughts. They excited her, creating a unique tension that she found herself needing to satisfy with increasing frequency, often in unusual places like her office, car or public bathrooms.

Initially, Jennifer used the hidden cameras to ensure her children were adequately cared for and looked after while she was away. She rationalized it as a means of being a responsible and vigilant mother, despite the questionable ethics of her secret surveillance. Yet, as the days turned into weeks, and she found herself spending more time away from home, those cameras became more than just a tool for parental supervision. The cameras evolved into a lifeline for Jennifer, connecting her to her family in a twisted and voyeuristic way. As Jennifer watched the footage from the cameras, she also couldn't help but notice how pretty and alluring Chloe was.

Jennifer's travel schedule intensified, and she found herself spending more time away from home. To fill the void of her absence, she relied on the video camera feeds to watch her family's daily activities. From hotel rooms in different corners of the world, she would silently observe her children playing with Chloe, cherishing those moments as much as she could.

Despite her attraction to Chloe, which she could no longer deny to herself, she prevented herself looking at the camera she had secretly installed in her room as this would have been an unforgivable invasion of her privacy in Jennifer's mind.

However, Jennifer couldn't escape the occasional temptation to check the camera feeds in her and Callum's bedroom. She knew it was an intrusion of privacy, and in these moments of vulnerability, she often stumbled upon Callum alone in bed, watching pornography on his laptop. Jennifer's heart sank, feeling a mix of guilt and sadness that she wasn't there for him. She yearned to provide him with the affection and attention he deserved, but the demands of her travels often left her drained and unable to fulfill her promises to herself even once she returned home.

A regrettable pattern developed, with Jennifer returning home exhausted and jet-lagged, leaving little energy for intimate moments with Callum. The passion in their relationship dwindled, and their sex life came to a grinding halt. The guilt of not being there for Callum weighed heavily on Jennifer's heart, fueling her insecurities even further.

Her lack of sexual interest in being with Callum was compounded by the energy she was expending fantasizing and masturbating to the thought of him cheating with Chloe.

One evening, alone in a hotel far from home, Jennifer felt an overwhelming need to connect with Callum. She searched for him on various cameras, but he was nowhere to be seen. In her mind, fear and jealousy started to creep in, imagining that he might be with someone else, possibly with Chloe in her room.

Feeling panicked, she impulsively turned on the camera in Chloe's room, but Callum wasn't there. Chloe was simply alone, undressing and getting ready for bed. Jennifer felt guilty about invading the au pair's privacy, but she couldn't bring herself to turn off the camera and kept watching instead.

Chloe's long blonde hair glided through her brush and fell onto her beautiful bare breasts before she carefully applied lotion to her skin. There was a sense of intimacy in this private moment, and Jennifer couldn't help but feel a connection to her.

Despite her guilt, Jennifer couldn't look away as Chloe settled on her bed, naked and began to touch her full perky tits and then her beautiful cunt. Jennifer wondered what Chloe was thinking about as she played with herself, and continued to watch, enthralled, as Chloe masturbated, using only her fingers, until she came with a muscle tightening, back arching climax.

While she had acknowledged the attractiveness of other women in the past, Jennifer had never encountered such a powerful and overwhelming sexual attraction as she did that evening. Surprisingly, her feelings of guilt seemed to amplify her arousal.

Eventually it was Jennifer's turn to lay on her bed, where she found solace in a private moment of self-exploration, gently stroking and teasing her own clitoris and pussy in a similar manner to Chloe until she orgasmed herself, still feeling both guilty and excited from the scene she had clandestinely observed.

The next day, Jennifer found it challenging to concentrate at work, preoccupied by her thoughts of Chloe and feeling a sense of guilt mixed with anticipation about potentially watching her again later that day. As Jennifer's guilt intensified, so did her curiosity.

Over the next three evenings, Jennifer spent excessive hours monitoring the camera in Chloe's room, observing her during vulnerable moments. Despite her guilt, Jennifer's desire to spy on Chloe only grew stronger.

Upon returning home from her trip, Jennifer initially felt awkward and embarrassed in Chloe's presence. However, with time, she learned to distinguish their two relationships--the one centered around the children and household while they were together and the secret fascination she had developed while watching her on camera.

Unfortunately, Jennifer's infatuation with Chloe began to strain her relationship with Callum. She lacked the energy and interest she once had in him, making it increasingly challenging to meet his needs. Any sexual desire she had was now spent watching Chloe on camera and pleasuring herself. Even when at home, Jennifer would retreat to her office in the evening, using work as an excuse to watch Chloe's camera.

Jennifer recognized that she needed to stop and that her marriage was at risk, but she found herself unable to break the cycle.

As Jennifer watched the live feed on the hidden camera, witnessing Chloe's lonely and intimate moments, a wave of conflicting emotions washed over her. Chloe, just nineteen, had become the pillar holding Jennifer's family together, but at what personal cost? The weight of responsibility weighed heavily on her slender shoulders, leaving her with no time for friends, no room for romance, and only rare glimpses of a social life.

As Jennifer delved deeper into her reflections, she couldn't shake the thought that Chloe's apparently vibrant social life had significantly diminished since moving into their home. The stories of past boyfriends that Chloe had shared now seemed like distant echoes, fading away in the backdrop of her solitary existence.

As Jennifer replayed her own carefree days at nineteen, the memory of youthful exploration danced before her. She remembered the thrill of discovering boys, and the adventure of embracing her own sexuality. In stark contrast, Chloe seemed to have forfeited these essential rites of passage, dedicating herself entirely to the well-being of Jennifer's family.

Jennifer's own sex life had dwindled, a mere ember compared to the fire of her youth. However, she had once tasted the excitement and freedom that came with exploration. Now, she feared that Chloe might never have the opportunity to catch up. Crudely, Jennifer acknowledged that Chloe needed to get laid.

However, Jennifer's concern for Chloe was not entirely selfless. The more she thought about Chloe's sacrifice, the more fixated she grew with the idea of watching Chloe with a lover, rather than just the moments of self-pleasure she was secretly privy to. Jennifer wrestled with her emotions, grappling with the understanding that these feelings were both intrusive and inappropriate. Yet, the allure of this infatuation was hard to resist. As she envisioned Chloe in different scenarios, Jennifer found herself drawn to the thrill of what could be, trapped in the web of her own desires.

At times, Jennifer's fascination with Chloe caused her to lose sight of Callum's needs, but in moments of reflection her concern also turned to him. Callum had always been a vibrant and social man, with a high sex drive that matched his outgoing personality. But now, in the wake of Jennifer's frequent absences and lack of emotional and physical energy when she was home, he seemed to be living a life devoid of fulfillment and passion.

As Jennifer continued to watch Callum's lonely evenings through the camera feeds, her heart ached with the weight of guilt and the realization of the toll her absence had taken on their marriage.",,2025-08-15T19:19:16.383209,3254,

Talia had already woken up and left, but everyone else was still asleep, so he crept around the snoozing forms and out of the tent. The slender elf was standing by the fireplace, watching a kettle that was steaming gently as it approached boiling. He stepped lightly as he moved behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her close. She let out a little shriek of surprise as he grabbed her, but then sighed and relaxed into his chest as she realised who it was.

""Are you ready to talk about why you've been avoiding me?"" Alex asked, rocking her slightly from side to side and kissing the top of her head.

""A little bit,"" she nuzzled her head back into his shoulder, ""I just felt bad about hitting you. I know you can cope with it, but I still shouldn't have done it. There's... a little more to it than that, but I'll tell you when I've had a bit more time and distance, if that's okay?""

""Of course,"" Alex smiled and kissed her again.

The kettle began whistling, and Talia broke away to finish making tea. The kettle lifted off from the fire by itself with a gesture from the elf, and she tipped in a small bundle of herbs which began stewing in the boiling water. She poured out two mugs, leaving the kettle next to the fire to keep warm, and Talia and Alex sipped at their drinks as the camp woke up around them.

It wasn't long before the camp was once more a bustle of activity. The carts which acted as a makeshift fence around the whole camp were redistributed to each group and loaded with cargo. Giant oxen the size of buildings were led over from a distant field and long trains of carts attached to each one. By the time the sun had fully risen, the first group of scouts had ridden out ahead to check the planned route and the army began to march.

The mech strode along beside the marching soldiers, keeping a slow gait so as not to outpace them. Talia sat beneath Alex's feet in the bottom of the cockpit, somehow finding a comfortable spot among all the metal beams and bolts that kept his seat secure. Daine and Borren sat on the shoulders, chatting animatedly about how excited they were to be finally moving, and Thrak and Gelb were perched in the hands. The gnome was tinkering with what looked like a steel bracer, scratching intricate lines into the surface with a metal stylus, while the orc was peacefully reading a book.

Long miles blurred into each other as the army slowly crossed the plains beneath a cloudy sky that threatened rain. Occasionally they would see a shock of red hair as Elizabeth rode by in the distance, joining the rest of her mounted troops in scouting the area. It was into the middle of the afternoon when the major rode up to them, slowing her horse to match their speed. Her hair was wild and wind-whipped, and her legs splattered with mud from hard riding.

""I've just had reports of a giant in the village up ahead,"" Elizabeth stood in her stirrups to talk directly to the captain, ""You want in on helping to clear it out?""

Alex looked around at his squad. Talia sat up by his feet, Thrak snapped his book shut and smiled a toothy grin, above him the dwarves had gone silent, waiting for his response, and Gelb finished the last symbol on his little project with a flourish, magic sparking off his fingers.

""We're ready if you are,"" said the gnome, eyes gleaming.

""Let's do it then,"" said Alex, looking back at the major with a grin, ""Hell yes we're in.""

Picking up the pace, the mech followed Elizabeth onwards to the front of the convoy, which was just drawing to a halt. Some gilded carriages flanked by ornately armoured knights clearly held the general and his aides. Elizabeth nodded to the scouts who were leading the column and then accelerated away, Alex following suit.

Travelling at a much faster speed than they had been, it didn't take long for the mech to crest the next hill and see the village. Squat, dark wood and thatch cottages clustered around a bend in a river as it wound its way through the hills. From a treeline many kilometres away, Alex scanned the area. His squad stood in front of him, a few paces further forward so they could see better.

""Reports say a large figure was seen wandering through the village,"" said Elizabeth, whispering unnecessarily, ""It has to be a giant, given the range it was seen from.""

""I think I see it,"" Alex stared blankly at nothing as the mech overrode his vision with data, ""Sitting behind one of the buildings. It's carrying some sort of weird sword, it's glowing like the sun to my scanners. Fifty other lifesigns. I can't tell what they are yet, but a dozen are in that larger building to the west.""

""I don't know what that means, but it doesn't sound good,"" said Thrak, chewing on his thumb as he thought, ""A 'weird sword' could be an enchantment. One large enough for a giant must be pretty powerful.""

""Got it, look out for the sword."" Alex nodded, drawing his consciousness back to his body and looking down, ""Anything else?""

""Goblins like ta hide inside, an' beastmen prefer the open,"" said Borren, who was running a pocket-sized whetstone over his axe, ""Nasty buggers, the lot of 'em. If anyone's left alive in that place, then they willnae be for much longer.""

""We should go then,"" said Talia.

She whipped her rapier back and forth a few times and Alex watched with fascination as it reshaped, the metal flowing and the balance shifting to better suit her grip. He reached into the storage rack beside him in the cockpit and tossed out the pistol and rifle to Talia and Thrak, the pistol arcing unerringly into the elf's outstretched hand as the orc caught his weapon awkwardly in his arms.

""I'm taking a contingent of scouts around to the west side,"" Elizabeth announced, walking back toward her horse and mounting up, ""If there's any survivors, they'll be in the village hall and we'll get them out. Captain, make a full assault on the village in any way you see fit. Try and draw them away from me and my men.""

""Copy that,"" Alex responded, closing the cockpit and switching to his speakers, ""See you on the other side, Major.""

As the major cantered away through the trees, the Irregulars stepped out of the treeline, looking across the empty fields between them and the village.

""Tha's a lot o' open ground,"" Daine noted, walking around the mech's leg and strapping a square shield to his arm.

""We weren't planning on taking them by surprise anyway,"" said Alex, running a final system check, ""Let's move, I'll keep us covered.""

The Irregulars set out at a swift jog, Alex constantly scanning the village to keep track of any movement. Before they had made it a hundred metres, a figure crossed between two buildings, looking in their direction. The mech's cameras zoomed in, trying to identify it. It was short, with gnarly green skin and pointed ears and teeth. A goblin. Alex raised an arm just as his systems check told him the laser was powered on. With a sharp crack, a pulse of high-energy light crossed the remaining kilometres and vaporised the creature's head.

A second creature, a shaggy, bovine beastman this time, wandered out and fell the same way. As the Irregulars reached the final stretch of distance an alarmed shout went up as someone saw the bodies. Alex sent out a scanner pulse and then gestured to one of the nearest cottages.

""Three in the left house, back corner. Through the door and clear them out,"" Alex shouted the order, taking another shot with his laser at an exposed head peeking around a corner.

The dwarves shouted and whooped in excitement, Borren throwing himself into the door and breaking it down, the others following behind. Alex strode into the village, keeping an eye out all around. Inside the house Daine and Borren pushed forwards as Talia and Thrak - with Gelb on his back - fired into the occupants. The goblins charged forwards, but were met head on by the dwarves who blocked them long enough for the others to take them down.

The squad made their way from building to building at Alex's direction as he towered overhead, watching the surroundings carefully. They were four houses into the sweep when a gleaming, armoured head poked up above a distant building and the giant bellowed a challenge across the village. Alex immediately snapped off a shot at it, but the laser did nothing apart from leave a scorch mark on the plated metal of the helmet.

The giant, female by the cut of its armour, stepped out into view. Clad head to toe in shining plate and wielding a metallic purple longsword, proportional in size to the huge creature, it rounded the corner onto the street Alex stood on and charged, sword held high. The repeated snapping of the laser blasted blackened craters into flesh and armour alike but didn't slow the charge.

With a howl of pain, the giant entered melee range and swung the sword. Remembering Thrak's warning, Alex quickly sidestepped, sliding his own blades out. The giant was quick though, and it threw a punch with its empty hand, knocking the mech off balance. Alex swung his blades wide, catching a glancing blow on the giant that cut the plate armour like foil but only scratched the flesh beneath. Still staggering, Alex fought to stay upright. Down the street, a goblin fired a crossbow at him and the bolt skittered off the faceplate of the mech, doing no damage but distracting him for long enough for the giant to kick at his legs.

The mech fell to the floor with a crash. Unable to dodge at all, Alex could do nothing but brace for impact as the sword speared towards him. In a nearby house, Talia screamed his name. There was a loud clang. The sword deflected off the chestplate. After a moment's shock, Alex grinned; this was how he was used to fighting. Invincible.

The mech raised an arm and the laser charged as the giant stared down in confusion, trying to figure out why its attack hadn't worked. Switching to a different wavelength, this time the laser ionised a thin beam of air connecting the mech and the giant. With a bright flash and a crack of thunder, a bolt of lightning arced across the conductive air and smashed into the giant. The plate armour buckled, glowing white hot where the bolt had hit. The giant collapsed without another word as Alex rolled out of the way.

Alex guided the mech to its feet, picking off the goblins and beastmen that had arrived to watch the fight with precise blasts from the laser. He saw Talia watching through a window, and she shouted a warning, pointing behind him. He spun about to the direction she was pointing just as a wave of shadow slammed into him. The dark energy passed right through the shell of the mech and rattled him against his harness, making his ears ring and the inside of his mouth taste of metal.

The mech stumbled to its knees as unholy roars filled the air, Alex turning the head to see a goblin dressed in black robes pointing at him with a glowing, green amulet attached to its neck with an iron chain. Translucent black tentacles suddenly burst from every surface and wrapped around the mech's limbs, pulling hard. Motors and hydraulics strained and dials swung into the red, but the mech wouldn't move. Only the right shoulder, marked with Talia's protective glyphs, had any freedom of movement. Wriggling with what little room he had, Alex felt some feedback as the fingers brushed against something. He gripped onto it, the handle of the giant's sword, and pulled it towards him. As it drew closer and closer, the purple blade seemed to drain the substance from the tentacles and their grip loosened. He planted the point in the ground and used it to lever himself upright and back onto his feet.

The goblin magician snarled angrily, baring long, yellow teeth as it gestured towards him again causing the tentacles to tighten their grip. Thrak stepped out of the building, the metal bracer Gelb had given him glowing brightly. The gnome himself was still strapped to the orc's back, and was making complicated gestures of his own as a silver shield shimmered into existence around the pair. Thrak raised the assault rifle, sighting down the barrel and squeezing the trigger. Despite the extreme distance, the shot struck home and passed clean through the goblin's chest. The magic tentacles abruptly vanished and Alex stumbled at the sudden lack of pressure, metal feet thudding on the dirt and gyroscopes whining as he kept his balance.

Scanning the area revealed absolute devastation. Houses lay in ruins and the bodies of goblins and beastmen lay all around. The various members of the Irregulars picked their way out onto the street. In the cockpit, Alex took a deep breath as the ringing faded from his ears, then activated the speakers.

""Let's keep moving,"" he said, brandishing the giant's sword with a flourish.

The rest of the village didn't put up much of a resistance. As they swept through towards the village hall, they found a few families, hiding in basements, who they left where they were for now. When they met up with the scouts, they were helping the few survivors in the village hall out into the open. Elizabeth was perched on the steps up to the grey stone building, wiping blood from her shortsword and watching the mech approached; unphased by the sight, unlike the rest of the soldiers and civilians who gaped upwards.

""How did it go, giant-slayer?"" she shouted up to him.

""Tough, but manageable,"" said Alex jovially, ""Spellcasters are tricky to deal with, but I think this might help.""

He held out the purple sword, rotating his mech's wrist all the way around to spin it about. Several people in the rescued group flinched, so he stopped and lowered the blade.

""You're not wrong,"" she said, sheathing her own sword, ""Mages are more of a pain to fight than giants sometimes. No offence Talia, Gelb.""

""None taken,"" squeaked Gelb.

Talia nervously smiled. A soldier pushed past her and saluted the major.

""We think the village is clear, major. Troops from the main force are moving in to sweep the area shortly,"" he announced with a salute.

""No need, we got them all,"" said Alex, sending out a scanning pulse, ""Not reading anymore lifesigns that aren't accounted for.""

The soldier glanced up at the mech, then back to the major with a concerned look on his face.

""If there's one lesson I can teach you today, corporal,"" said Elizabeth, in a disturbingly sweet voice, ""It's to trust the man in the giant mech. Unless the captain's orders contradict mine, you should consider him your superior.""

""Yes Major Swift,"" he saluted again, taking another fearful glance at Alex, ""Of course.""

It took a few hours for the army to arrive, thousands upon thousands of soldiers and staff moving in and setting up camp in the fields around the village. The bodies were all piled up and burned, and Alex spent some time clearing rubble away from houses so they could be reconstructed later by the survivors. As the day drew to a close, he walked around the camp, spotting the ragged tent of the Irregulars and powering down the mech.

As they sat around eating their evening meal in the dusk light, Alex and Talia looked over the strange purple sword. Talia ran her fingers delicately across the metal, furrowing her brow in confusion and frustration. The blade was straight and simple, roughly sharpened with many scratches and gouges in the dark, purplish metal. It looked like it had been cut from a much larger metal plate.

""I can't tell what it is,"" the elf shook her head, standing up and stalking away in disappointment, ""It's draining my magic, so I can't use my magic to work out what it's made of.""

Alex scratched his head thoughtfully, looking over the giant longsword. He had never seen anything like it used as a weapon. He had however, he suddenly realised, seen that kind of metal before.

""I know what that is,"" he laughed in surprise, ""That's a shard of reactor shielding. At that size it must be from a starship.""

""Reactor shielding?"" asked Thrak, who was reading by the fire.

""Yeah,"" he ran his fingers through his hair, ""It's used to contain the energy in a slipspace reactor. There's even a small amount in my mech's backpack unit. I wonder why it drains magic though...""

""Maybe your magic works the same as ours,"" the orc suggested, licking his thumb and carefully turning a page.

""It's not magic..."" Alex started to explain, but then paused, ""...actually, you might have a point there. That's an interesting thought.""

""Glad I could be of assistance,"" the orc raised a meaty eyebrow without looking up from his book.

They shared the same tent again that night, easily falling into a deep sleep from a hard day of marching and fighting. Once again, Alex began to dream.

*****

The steel city was strangely silent, as always. As with last time, Alex found himself alone. He tucked himself into a corner as quickly as he could manage, not wanting to be caught out by the other two mech pilots he had seen the previous night. What could have been minutes or hours later, he looked up to see Anna, stood stock still in the middle of the road. As he watched, she took a sudden gasp of air and shook herself, looking around disoriented. He waved, catching her attention, and she walked over.

""Hi,"" she smiled nervously, looking down at her feet.

""Hey,"" he responded, smiling back with confidence he didn't really have.

They stood in awkward silence for a while; two soldiers, bred and trained for war for over a century and a half between them, too afraid to speak. After an uncomfortable length of time, Alex finally spoke up.

""So,"" he began, ""How are you...""

Alex never got to finish his question as Anna suddenly launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around him and kissing him passionately. He reeled for a moment, then kissed her back and pulled her against him. They broke apart but continued holding each other tightly, needing to breathe but unwilling to let each other go.

""You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment,"" Anna gasped, dazed and exhilarated.

""You'd be surprised,"" Alex smirked playfully, ""You weren't exactly subtle about it.""

""Oh yeah?"" she challenged, kissing him again and grinning, ""Try the first day of training you ran.""

""Really?"" Alex raised his eyebrows in surprise, ""You were barely a teenager then.""

""I know,"" she sighed, resting her head on his shoulder, ""But you were kind and smart, and more charismatic than you thought you were. I started having weird thoughts about you when you grabbed my waist to correct my posture in close-quarters training, and they never went away.""

""I never realised,"" he ran his fingers through her hair, enjoying the silken locks against his skin.

""Mhmm,"" she relaxed even further into his arms, ""So I've had a very long time to come up with all sorts of filthy things I want to do with you.""

Alex froze, and Anna burst out laughing at his sudden shock. After a moment he joined in, and they collapsed to the floor laughing, hugging and kissing.

*****

The morning was met with a fine drizzle from a uniform, grey sky. It reminded Alex strangely of the dreamscape, though when Talia asked about his silence he pretended nothing was wrong and made more of an effort at polite conversation as they ate and packed up their tent.

The army left the little village behind to pick up the rubble and rebuild their lives. Marching onwards through the rain and mud, they made slow and steady progress in their relentless journey north. After a bit of thought and some clever use of ropes, the dwarves managed to sling the sword behind the mech's back and string up the tent canvas above its head like a shawl. The Irregulars travelled on safe from the rain, much to the jealousy of the column of damp and muddy troops beside them.

=== PAGE BREAK ===

Alex awoke feeling relaxed and refreshed. Talia had already woken up and left, but everyone else was still asleep, so he crept around the snoozing forms and out of the tent. The slender elf was standing by the fireplace, watching a kettle that was steaming gently as it approached boiling. He stepped lightly as he moved behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her close. She let out a little shriek of surprise as he grabbed her, but then sighed and relaxed into his chest as she realised who it was.

""Are you ready to talk about why you've been avoiding me?"" Alex asked, rocking her slightly from side to side and kissing the top of her head.

""A little bit,"" she nuzzled her head back into his shoulder, ""I just felt bad about hitting you. I know you can cope with it, but I still shouldn't have done it. There's... a little more to it than that, but I'll tell you when I've had a bit more time and distance, if that's okay?""

""Of course,"" Alex smiled and kissed her again.

The kettle began whistling, and Talia broke away to finish making tea. The kettle lifted off from the fire by itself with a gesture from the elf, and she tipped in a small bundle of herbs which began stewing in the boiling water.

Scanning the area revealed absolute devastation. Houses lay in ruins and the bodies of goblins and beastmen lay all around. The various members of the Irregulars picked their way out onto the street. In the cockpit, Alex took a deep breath as the ringing faded from his ears, then activated the speakers.

""Let's keep moving,"" he said, brandishing the giant's sword with a flourish.

The rest of the village didn't put up much of a resistance. As they swept through towards the village hall, they found a few families, hiding in basements, who they left where they were for now. When they met up with the scouts, they were helping the few survivors in the village hall out into the open. Elizabeth was perched on the steps up to the grey stone building, wiping blood from her shortsword and watching the mech approached; unphased by the sight, unlike the rest of the soldiers and civilians who gaped upwards.

""How did it go, giant-slayer?"" she shouted up to him.

""Tough, but manageable,"" said Alex jovially, ""Spellcasters are tricky to deal with, but I think this might help.""

He held out the purple sword, rotating his mech's wrist all the way around to spin it about. Several people in the rescued group flinched, so he stopped and lowered the blade.

""You're not wrong,"" she said, sheathing her own sword, ""Mages are more of a pain to fight than giants sometimes. No offence Talia, Gelb.""

""None taken,"" squeaked Gelb.

Talia nervously smiled. A soldier pushed past her and saluted the major.

""We think the village is clear, major. Troops from the main force are moving in to sweep the area shortly,"" he announced with a salute.

""No need, we got them all,"" said Alex, sending out a scanning pulse, ""Not reading anymore lifesigns that aren't accounted for.""

The soldier glanced up at the mech, then back to the major with a concerned look on his face.

""If there's one lesson I can teach you today, corporal,"" said Elizabeth, in a disturbingly sweet voice, ""It's to trust the man in the giant mech. Unless the captain's orders contradict mine, you should consider him your superior.""

""Yes Major Swift,"" he saluted again, taking another fearful glance at Alex, ""Of course.""

It took a few hours for the army to arrive, thousands upon thousands of soldiers and staff moving in and setting up camp in the fields around the village. The bodies were all piled up and burned, and Alex spent some time clearing rubble away from houses so they could be reconstructed later by the survivors. As the day drew to a close, he walked around the camp, spotting the ragged tent of the Irregulars and powering down the mech.

As they sat around eating their evening meal in the dusk light, Alex and Talia looked over the strange purple sword. Talia ran her fingers delicately across the metal, furrowing her brow in confusion and frustration. The blade was straight and simple, roughly sharpened with many scratches and gouges in the dark, purplish metal. It looked like it had been cut from a much larger metal plate.

""I can't tell what it is,"" the elf shook her head, standing up and stalking away in disappointment, ""It's draining my magic, so I can't use my magic to work out what it's made of.""

Alex scratched his head thoughtfully, looking over the giant longsword. He had never seen anything like it used as a weapon. He had however, he suddenly realised, seen that kind of metal before.

""I know what that is,"" he laughed in surprise, ""That's a shard of reactor shielding. At that size it must be from a starship.""

""Reactor shielding?"" asked Thrak, who was reading by the fire.

""Yeah,"" he ran his fingers through his hair, ""It's used to contain the energy in a slipspace reactor. There's even a small amount in my mech's backpack unit. I wonder why it drains magic though...""

""Maybe your magic works the same as ours,"" the orc suggested, licking his thumb and carefully turning a page.

""It's not magic..."" Alex started to explain, but then paused, ""...actually, you might have a point there. That's an interesting thought.""

""Glad I could be of assistance,"" the orc raised a meaty eyebrow without looking up from his book.

They shared the same tent again that night, easily falling into a deep sleep from a hard day of marching and fighting. Once again, Alex began to dream.

*****

The steel city was strangely silent, as always. As with last time, Alex found himself alone. He tucked himself into a corner as quickly as he could manage, not wanting to be caught out by the other two mech pilots he had seen the previous night. What could have been minutes or hours later, he looked up to see Anna, stood stock still in the middle of the road. As he watched, she took a sudden gasp of air and shook herself, looking around disoriented. He waved, catching her attention, and she walked over.

""Hi,"" she smiled nervously, looking down at her feet.

""Hey,"" he responded, smiling back with confidence he didn't really have.

They stood in awkward silence for a while; two soldiers, bred and trained for war for over a century and a half between them, too afraid to speak. After an uncomfortable length of time, Alex finally spoke up.

""So,"" he began, ""How are you...""

Alex never got to finish his question as Anna suddenly launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around him and kissing him passionately. He reeled for a moment, then kissed her back and pulled her against him. They broke apart but continued holding each other tightly, needing to breathe but unwilling to let each other go.

""You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment,"" Anna gasped, dazed and exhilarated.

""You'd be surprised,"" Alex smirked playfully, ""You weren't exactly subtle about it.""

""Oh yeah?"" she challenged, kissing him again and grinning, ""Try the first day of training you ran.""

""Really?"" Alex raised his eyebrows in surprise, ""You were barely a teenager then.""

""I know,"" she sighed, resting her head on his shoulder, ""But you were kind and smart, and more charismatic than you thought you were. I started having weird thoughts about you when you grabbed my waist to correct my posture in close-quarters training, and they never went away.""

""I never realised,"" he ran his fingers through her hair, enjoying the silken locks against his skin.

""Mhmm,"" she relaxed even further into his arms, ""So I've had a very long time to come up with all sorts of filthy things I want to do with you.""

Alex froze, and Anna burst out laughing at his sudden shock. After a moment he joined in, and they collapsed to the floor laughing, hugging and kissing.

*****

The morning was met with a fine drizzle from a uniform, grey sky. It reminded Alex strangely of the dreamscape, though when Talia asked about his silence he pretended nothing was wrong and made more of an effort at polite conversation as they ate and packed up their tent.

The army left the little village behind to pick up the rubble and rebuild their lives. Marching onwards through the rain and mud, they made slow and steady progress in their relentless journey north. After a bit of thought and some clever use of ropes, the dwarves managed to sling the sword behind the mech's back and string up the tent canvas above its head like a shawl. The Irregulars travelled on safe from the rain, much to the jealousy of the column of damp and muddy troops beside them.",,2025-08-15T19:19:21.202268,3489,2.0
https://www.literotica.com/s/thats-what-friends-are-for-35,That's What Friends Are For,Unknown Author,,,,,"""Ravi's been attracted to you for a long time,"" I say.

""He's your

boyfriend

,"" Sarah says. ""I don't want things to get weird,""

We're sitting in a coffeehouse in Venice Beach, near the bike shop where she works. Ravi and I have known her since college... long before Ravi and I were a couple. We were never close friends, but we were always part of the same crowd. We went to the same parties, saw the same bands. You know how it is.

Over the last few years, though, we've drifted apart. Ravi and I are working real jobs, renting a decent apartment. We even bought a couch together. Sarah though, she's deeper into the scene than ever. There's a tat I haven't seen before on her forearm, a fresh piercing through her left eyebrow. I suspect she thinks my new conservative look is ridiculous. I can't say I disagree with her.

""Things won't get weird,"" I say. ""We have a deal. It's strictly a one-time thing... a birthday present.""

""You want to give Ravi a threesome for his birthday?""

""It won't be a threesome,"" I say. ""I'm not into... I mean... it's okay if you are... it's just that I don't....""

""I get it,"" Sarah says, laughing. ""You don't eat pussy. It's cool. Neither do I. So, if it's not a threesome, what is it?""

I shrug. ""Just a casual hookup.""

""Just casual hookup... with a guy I barely know... while his girlfriend watches.""

""So it won't be cheating! If you two were alone, it would be like he was cheating on me. But if I'm there....""

""... that makes it okay?"" Sarah's expression is dubious. ""Um... whatever you say, girl....""

""Ravi and I worked it out! We have a deal! It's strictly a one-time thing....""

I know how ridiculous I must sound. I can feel my cheeks burning.

""Look, forget I ever mentioned it. It was a stupid thing to ask. I'm sorry I brought it up.""

""Hey, hey... don't be like that! I'm not saying no. I always did think Ravi was kind of cute. I just want to know what I'm be getting into. I don't want any drama.""

I hold up my hand. ""No drama. I swear.""

Sarah takes a sip of her latte. ""Does he have a nice cock?""

I nod. ""Oh yes.""

""Long?""

""Long-ish. But thick. You know what I mean? When he's inside you, you really feel it. You're flat on your back, with your feet up in the air. He climbs on top of you, sticks in it, and then he starts thrusting. All that hard thickness is riding in and out of your... uh....""

Suddenly embarrassed, I let my voice trail off. Sarah shakes her head and laughs.

""Damn girl, listen to you! When did you become such a freak?""

""So... um, anyway... are you in?""

""With an endorsement like that, how can I say no?"" Sarah laughs

* * *

That night when Ravi gets home from work, I'm chopping carrots in the kitchen. He drops his bag by the door, and kisses the back of my neck.

""Hey babe,"" he says. ""You have a good day?""

""Not bad,"" I say. ""How about you?""

""It's getting better already,"" he says, nuzzling up against me. His hands are on my hips, pulling me back towards him.

""Hey... watch it!"" I say, twisting away. ""Woman with a knife here!""

He laughs and lets go, opens the fridge to get a beer. ""You know I can't resist you when you're being domestic.""

I glance down and wiggle my toes. ""I am barefoot, and I am in the kitchen.""

""My dream girl.""

I nod my head. ""Damn straight. Best thing that ever happened to you.""

He takes a sip of his beer and glances at the knife. I love the look he's got in his eyes.

""Okay. You're safe for now,"" he says, grinning. ""But after dinner, babe, it's on....""

""Ha! What makes you so sure I'll want you?""

""Because you always want me,"" he says matter-of-factly.

I have to admit, he's right.

* * *

I wait until we're having sex to tell him.

I'm naked, flat on my back on the living room floor with my feet up in the air just like I described to Sarah. Ravi is on top of me, fucking me hard. He's got my wrists pinned over my head and I'm wide open, taking him deep. I'm going to have rug burns on my shoulder blades.

""She said yes,"" I mutter breathlessly.

There's a stutter in his rhythm. His face is a mixture of lust and bafflement.

""Who said yes?"" he pants.

""Sarah,"" I say. His thrusts push the words out of me. ""I... had... lunch... with... her... today... and... oh fuck!""

Ravi freezes mid-stroke. He's deep inside me, and I can feel his cock throbbing. We stare at each other, breathing hard.

""Wait, what?"" he says. ""You saw Sarah? You actually asked her?""

I bite my lip. I want him to move so bad. But he's holding completely still.

""Uh-huh,"" I say, nodding. ""She's good with it. With... all of it. Please don't stop.""

""Oh shit, sorry.""

He starts up again, slower now, gentler and more deliberate. I can feel every inch of him as he slides into me. Oh, fuck that's good. I wriggle with delight, wrap my legs around him, crossing my ankles behind his sweet ass.

""Oh, fuck yeah... just like that,"" I moan. ""Fuck me, baby.""

""How did she look?"" he asks.

""Is she still hot, you mean?"" I tease.

""Yeah, I guess,"" he admits sheepishly

I nod. ""Yeah, she's still hot.""

""You're amazing,"" he says. ""I don't deserve you.""

I kiss him hard on the mouth. I love him so much right now. The way we're moving together is sublime. We're so perfectly in synch, I can't tell where my body ends and where his begins. I can feel his muscles start to go rigid, so I know he must be close. I'm close too.

""Are you gonna cum inside me, babe?"" I pant. ""Are you gonna cum inside my sweet little pussy?""

He loves it when I talk dirty.

""God... yes... fuck... yes."" He can barely get the words out. His voice is a deep growl.

He lets go of my wrists and grabs my hips, lifting my ass off the ground. He's on his knees, pounding in and out of me. I'm moaning, thrashing. Our sex is generally pretty good, but it's been a while since it's been this good. He pumps me full, then hugs me and kisses me and cuddles me.

* * *

We fuck a lot over the next few weeks. It's like he's trying to prove that hooking up with Sarah won't mean anything. I don't know if he's trying to prove it to me, or to himself. Maybe to both of us.

For his birthday, we don't go out. We have a nice meal at home and Sarah comes over to share it with us.

When I call to invite her, she understands immediately what the score is. I'm grateful she doesn't make me spell it out--dinner first, then Ravi gets his present.

And no drama.

I wear my little black party dress and open-toed heels. I look sexy. I

feel

sexy.

Ravi is just in a normal button-down shirt and blue jeans, but it's his birthday, so it's okay if he doesn't want to dress up.

The two of us are puttering around the apartment, making dinner, cleaning up the place. When the doorbell rings it startles both of us.

Sarah is wearing an old floral-print cotton dress that I'm guessing she got at a thrift store, and battered Converse sneakers with white ankle socks. She's still cute as hell.

When I open the door, she hands me a bottle of wine.

""I hope red is okay.""

""Red is great,"" I say, smiling a little too wide.

We try to make small talk over the chicken tikka masala, but everything is forced and strange. Ravi tries to talk to Sarah about bands we used to follow, but she's into different music now, and the conversation goes nowhere. Eventually we let him ramble on about his job.

By the end of dinner we're all really drunk. We polish off the wine Sarah brought, and also the two bottles I got at Bevmo this afternoon. Afterwards, we retreat into the living room to smoke some weed.

""So how do we do this?"" Sarah says with a little laugh. ""Just take off our clothes and start going at it?""

I sit off to one side in a plain wooden chair so the two of them can share the couch. Sarah kicks off her sneakers and flops down next to Ravi.

He takes a big hit from the bong and passes it to her. She takes a big hit too, and an after a massive coughing fit, she sets down the bong down on the coffee table and casually lays her hand on Ravi's crotch.

His eyes open wide.

""Just so we're clear--no kissing, okay?"" Sarah says.

""Okay,"" Ravi nods. ""No kissing.""

I can tell from the bulge in his jeans he's already hard.

Sarah's floral dress clings to her thin body. She's not wearing a bra, and I can see her nipples through the thin fabric.

I feel a pang of jealousy. I can tell why he's so hung up on her. She really is amazingly cute. I also know it's also the ""forbidden fruit"" aspect of doing it with a white girl.

Ravi reaches out and touches Sarah's bare leg. He slides his brown hand up under her flouncy skirt. Her dress rides up, giving me a brief view of her skinny little white-girl ass and her pink panties.

Meanwhile she's unbuckling his belt. She slips her hand inside his jeans and wraps her fingers around his thick cock.

This is where things get surreal. Up until now it's just been some old friends hanging out, getting stoned and chatting, but now it's a

hook-up

.

Sarah takes Ravi's junk out of his pants. She looks at me as she does it, making sure that I'm cool with this escalation. I have to be, don't I? This is what we agreed to. This is part of the deal.

She's fascinated that he's uncut, and she experiments with it by jerking him a little, pulling his foreskin skin down until the shiny pink head peeks out.

""Is it okay if I suck him?"" she asks me.

""Totally,"" I nod. ""Go for it.""

Sarah bends over and delicately takes Ravi's big brown cock into her mouth. Her slender fingers stroke his shaved balls.

It's weird. I've sucked Ravi off a hundred times, but I've never had the opportunity to watch his face while I do it. Today, his expression softens into such a gentle look of gratitude that my final lingering misgivings completely evaporate. I'm so glad that Sarah and I are giving him this gift.

He lightly touches the back of her head, like he's trying to reassure himself that this is really happening.

Sarah kisses all along the length of his shaft, then takes him deep. While she's blowing him, she's also unbuttoning her dress. There are tiny mother-of-pearl buttons all down the front, and she undoes all of them one-by-one, then shrugs it off her shoulders.

The delicate wings of her shoulder blades shift under her pale skin. She's really tiny up top--hardly any tits at all--but they're still big enough to sway a little as she bobs her head up and down on Ravi's cock.

Her nipples are tiny too, and a delicate shade of pink, the color of seashells. Ravi reaches out and touches them, again with an air of not quite believing this is really happening.

""Do you want to suck them?"" Sarah asks in a husky voice.

Ravi nods. He does want to suck her pretty pink titties.

She sits up straight and stretches her arms over her head. The little tufts of light brown hair under her arms are damp with sweat.

Ravi leans over and presses his lips to her left breast. His cock is standing straight up, all wet and shiny from being in her mouth.

She looks down at him with a pouty expression on her face as he sucks and nuzzles her tits.

""Why don't you take off my panties,"" she suggests.

She raises her bottom up off the couch to make it easier for him. He hooks his fingers in the elastic waistband and drags her panties down her skinny thighs. But he's so eager he rushes it, and they get all tangled around her ankles. Sarah laughs and helps him. She pulls her panties the rest of the way off herself, and tosses them on the coffee table next to the bong.

Her pussy is as hairy as her armpits--a soft nest of light-brown hair.

She's naked now, except for her little white socks.

Ravi has his cock in his hand, jerking it.

""Can I eat you out?"" He asks shyly.

""Sure,"" she shrugs. ""Why not?""

She leans back and rests her heels on the edge of the couch, spreading her thighs.

Ravi groans and shoves the coffee table back to give himself room to maneuver. He eagerly dives in, rubbing his cheek against her furry crotch, coating himself with her scent.

Her pussy lips are pink too--delicate baroque folds, dewy with arousal. Tentatively, Ravi sticks his tongue in her slit. Sarah wriggles her hips urging him on.

She looks straight at me, making sure I'm still okay with what's going on. This is what we agreed to? Right?

I nod. Right.

Ravi's jerking himself like crazy. He's so turned on I think for a minute he's going to cum without even fucking her.

But he's definitely not going to miss out on fucking her. He rests his brown hands on the inside of her pale thighs, spreading her even wider. The dripping head of his cock is just inches away from Sarah's pink little cunt.

""You're protected, right?"" Ravi growls.

""Yeah, I'm good,"" Sarah nods.

I want to look away, but I can't, because we made a deal, right? It's not cheating if I watch them do it. And they're totally gonna do it.

Ravi rubs his big veiny cock on Sarah's bush, giving her a little preview of what's coming next.

""Oh yeah... stick it in,"" Sarah says.

She looks down to watch him penetrate her. Her mouth makes a little ""o"" as she discovers for herself just how thick he is.

Then she reaches down between her thighs to guide him, touching the veiny shaft of his cock, touching him where he's going in, touching her delicate pink pussy lips, where she's open to receive him.

She takes it all, the whole thick length of him, all the way to the root.

""Holy shit,"" Sarah says softly, her eyelids fluttering.

I feel a sympathetic tingle between my own legs--a sensory echo of the last time I had Ravi's cock inside my pussy. I know exactly how Sarah feels right now. That same delicious fullness.

Her sock-covered feet are up in the air, her toes pointed.

Ravi starts to move, plowing her with slow steady strokes.

I go stand next to the couch, inches away from where the two of them are going at it.

It's weird being fully dressed while they're completely naked. It's also weird watching my boyfriend fuck someone else. I can see everything. The way his cock slides into her. The way her pussy lips wrap around it.

She's making sexy little noises as he thrusts into her, little uh-uh-uh sounds.

Ravi grabs her wrists and pins her arms over her head, exposing her hairy armpits, stretching her out long and lean on our couch--the couch we picked out together.

He leans in to kiss her, but she turns her head to one side, offering him her bare throat instead.

""Remember... no kissing,"" Sarah scolds.

""It's okay if you cum in me, though"" she adds, glancing up at me for confirmation.

I nod my head. ""Yeah, you can cum in her,"" I say. ""Cum inside that sweet little pussy.""

I know what my man likes. As soon as the words leave my lips, Ravi picks up the pace, really starts to pound her, really starts to rail her.

Sarah has her head thrown back and her eyes closed. She's making little whimpering noises. I told you, right? I told you he had a nice cock.

I can tell Ravi's about to cum. His big brown balls are swaying in his shaved sack as he thrusts, slapping against Sarah's pale ass.

His cute butt suddenly clinches, his balls tighten, and he gives one final thrust....

He makes a desperate little noise, halfway between a groan and a whimper.

Sarah herself is goes totally silent. She lays there, trembling underneath him, arms pinned over her head, feet in the air, completely absorbed in her private orgasm.

This was what we agreed to. Ravi gets to fuck her once as a birthday present. No kissing. No drama.

It's done. Ravi lets go of her wrists and slithers out of her. Stunned, I watch his cock emerge from her hairy hole. He's still half-hard, slick and shiny from being inside her. A thread of cum connects them, stretching from the head of his cock to her wet pussy.

Then Ravi gets unsteadily to his feet and looks down in amazement at his handiwork. Sarah is gaping. A trickle of milky semen runs down her ass onto the couch. Onto our couch. I know it's going to stain, and I feel a pang.

Her eyes flutter open. She rests her hand on her tummy above her bush.

""Wow,"" she says softly, looking up at me. ""When you said he was thick, you weren't kidding....""

We're all still really stoned and drunk. Ravi wanders back to our bedroom, his wet dick flopping against his thighs. I get Sarah some tissues so she can clean up. She dabs ineffectually at her leaking pussy. She's in no condition to drive.

I tell her it's cool if she wants to crash on the couch, and bring her a fuzzy blanket and one of Ravi's old tee shirts to sleep in. The shirt is way too big on her.

""How are you doing?"" Sarah asks, as I shake out the blanket.

""Okay I guess,"" I say, looking off to the side.

I'm not feeling okay at all.

Then I follow after Ravi, turning down the lights so Sarah can get some sleep. The last I see of her she's lying on the couch pulling the blanket up under her chin.

Ravi's waiting for me in our bedroom, sitting naked on the edge of our bed, his thick cock hanging down between his open legs.

He watches me take off my clothes--my sexy party dress, my fancy bra, my lacy panties. I don't make a production out of it--this is just me getting ready for bed. I'm still a little tipsy myself and I stumble as I take off my heels.

Completely naked, I go stand in front of him. He rests his hands on my hips, and bends forward until his forehead touches my belly.

""Thank you,"" he says.

""Happy birthday,"" I reply, stroking his head.

I don't tell him, but I really want to fuck him right now. Watching him with Sarah got me so turned on... and I also want to make sure he still wants me.

""Should I let my bush grow out?"" I say.

""I don't know. I like you like this.""

He kisses down my tummy, until he reaches my smooth cleft. He presses his lips to my mound, just above the start of my split.

His hand is up between my legs, playing with my pussy lips. I shift my feet a little, widening my stance, giving him better access. He slips two fingers inside me. He knows how I like to be touched.

""You're really wet,"" he comments.

My pussy is making little smacking noises as he moves his fingers in and out. I

am

really wet. I play with my titties for a while as ride his hand, pinching my dark nipples. I've got bigger breasts than Sarah, so that's something.

He's already hard again. He just shot off in Sarah a little while ago, but he's already ready to go.

Ravi flops back on the bed, his erection standing straight up. I get down next him and nuzzle it. I can

smell

her on him, the musky aroma of Sarah's cunt. I meant it when I told her I don't eat pussy. Normally the idea of doing it with a girl doesn't do anything for me, but smelling Sarah's cunt on Ravi's cock is the sexiest thing....

I gingerly take him into my mouth. Now I can

taste

her. This is what Sarah's pussy tastes like. It's like I'm sucking Ravi's cock and eating her out at the same time.

I take my time blowing him, playing with his balls a little, doing everything he likes, reminding him what a good little cocksucker I am, how good we are together. I take him right up to the edge, until he starts jerking his hips up off the bed, eager little thrusts.

I'm eager too. I want his cock in my cunt so bad it's a physical ache. I climb up on the bed and straddle him, rubbing the pink head against my wet pussy lips. Slowly I lower myself onto him, impaling myself on his thick cock. Then I lean over so he can suck my womanly breasts while I fuck him.

His strong hands are on my generous hips, guiding me, urging me on.

Does my pussy feel as good as Sarah's? Am I as wet and tight? I do have one advantage over her--I know him better than she does. I know all his kinks and urges.

I play with my tits for him, squeezing my nipples, showing off for him. I bend over so they dangle in his face and he can suck them. I roll my hips for him, urging him on toward his orgasm, showing him what a bad girl I am. I want him to cum inside me the way he came inside her.",,2025-08-15T19:19:55.545556,3745,
https://www.literotica.com/s/brittany-becomes-a-cuckquean,Brittany Becomes a Cuckquean,Unknown Author,,,,,"My name is Ralph. I have been with my current girlfriend Brittany for a little over two years now and things have been great. She is pretty good looking dark curly hair nice curvy legs big tits not the ungodly huge kind but big enough to get a good handful when we are getting dirty with each other and a very dirty mind in bed. All this turned out to be great for me since I am kinda a freak myself.

We had been together about three months when I discovered her submissive side. She liked me to call her my little bitch spank her and with a little coaxing from me she even started calling me master. She would let me do just about anything I wanted to her in bed. However our escapades in bed was it. She never let it out of the bedroom and in fact would try to get rather controlling in the rest of our day to day lives. this all changed about 7 months ago to my great benefit and That my friends is where our story begins.

It happened on what would be a otherwise normal day at the job I have at a truck stop. I was Working a graveyard shift and since we live in Oregon I had just come outside to pump gas for a rather rude customer. Well of course his credit card would not work on the pump so I informed him he would have to go inside to pay this did not make him happy he got out murmuring something about me being a lazy ass as he went inside. I continued and filled his truck with gas and just as I was finishing he came back out and got in his rig my cashier came over the radio and informed me that he had paid so I put the gas cap on and as I did his engine started and before I could even close the fuel door he took off so quickly the fuel door slammed shut from the forward motion and the tires spun out. When he did that it sent a pebble that had been on the ground into the side of my head.

The pain felt like I had been hit by a train in that spot. It took all I had not to fall over right there I felt different it was like I could feel the space around me I stumbled over to my car one of my coworkers alice came over and freaked out when she saw blood running out of that spot. I knew how she felt but not like you think I mean I actually could feel her emotions almost like he was inside her head as a matter of fact I felt quite sure I could see thru her eyes if I tried so I did try and realized I could In fact see thru her eyes and thought that might be somehow useful later but right then even with how much my head hurt I wanted to explore what was happening right now.

Then this random customer went out the doors to his car and I could sense him I felt I could do exactly what I had with alice but thought better of it Alice would be way better to experiment with. So with that thought I jumped straight back into Alice's mind I wanted to try the next step controlling her mind. So I begun to tell her brain that she wanted to offer to buy me a soda to help me feel better . and before I could even finish thinking it she made the offer. I accepted and she ran to get it.

When she returned I wanted to see if I could make her forget things that have happened so I started trying to make her forget about buying me the soda then I gave her a ten dollar bill and asked her to get me a soda and she did when she came back and I was drinking the first one she brought she asked how I got it. Fuck yes so far this is amazing. I could do anything with this I thought. That's when I decided to have some fun I told alice in her head that she wanted to show me her tits that she just wanted to do it right then and now. I could tell it had worked she squirmed a little then lifted her shirt and shook her tits at me. Holy shit I thought I I told Alice's brain to for get that last bit. The rest of the night I refrained from using my new found abilities. But I wanted to the whole time. Seven o'clock came and I went home thinking of all the things I could have my way about.

When I pulled up to the house and went inside I found brittany still asleep as I entered the room she got irritated and told me to be quiet. It pissed me off I thought to myself I am tired of that part of her attitude and now that I can change it she will be acting how I want starting right now. I jumped strait into her head and told her she should be ashamed of how she just spoke to me that I am her master and she needs to show me some respect. I continued to tell her to get up apologize and make me breakfast right this moment. I did this while I was angry and found myself almost yelling in her head. The effect was immediate she got strait up looked into my eyes and apologized then asked if I was hungry I said ya then she offered to make me bacon and eggs. I smile and said that would be great. And she hurried off to the kitchen.

I spent the next half hour or so while she was cooking thinking about what I wanted to do with my powers and before I could help it I found myself thinking about all the fantasy's I had that I knew she would never go for. The big one was that I wanted to cuckquean Brittany to make her sit back and watch me fuck another girl in front of her. Even better I wanted to do it with one of the girls around town that I knew she hated I thought this would be a huge turn on since it would be totally humiliating to her to have to watch her enemy fuck the love of her life right in front of her. So when she came back from the kitchen with my breakfast I started to put my plan into action.

I dove straight into her mind and begun making her want to be humiliated filling her with the idea that seeing me fuck some other girl would be hot. Then I filled her with the Want to ask me if I would go along with it. And almost immediately she asked if she could ask me something crazy. I knowingly said of course. And it bust from her mouth like a dam had burst. Baby if I can make it happen would you be OK with fucking another girl in front of me. I of course was already in her head telling her give in to anything I wanted to get me to go along with it. I turned and looked at her and said that's kinda a strange request and if she was sure. She said she was totally sure and that she would do anything if I said yes. I told her I would do it but I had to be able to choose what girl. And if I was gonna go long with this for her she needed to understand that she is my complete slave at all times not just in bed and she was to obey my commands even when she did not want to. She answered by saying OK you got it so quickly I almost could not believe it.

So I started thinking about it and I knew almost immediately who I wanted it to be. Tiffany was a cute blonde hair blue eyed knockout I had been roommates with when me and Brittany got together and if it had not been for having a boyfriend when we lived together I would have rather got with her instead Brittany thought this was the case so they had been hostile to each other. I tried to see if I could reach Tiffany's mind from where I was and realized I had no problem doing it that's when I realized I could reach the mind of anyone in the world from anywhere so I set to work making tiffany want what I had in mind I made sure to impress on Tiffany's mind that Brittany was to be completely humiliated.then I turned to Brittany with a smile on my face and said. OK you can eat later babe I am ready to do this. Call tiffany and set it up for me.

The look on Brittany's face was priceless as she realized she was about to have to call her worst enemy and ask her to fuck me while she watched. she started to give me a pity look and I told her. Dammit bitch obey your master now or I will get my belt out. Brittany who's mind I had obviously programmed well jumped straight to her feet apologized and went to make the call. after only a few minutes Brittany returned to say tiffany would be here within a half hour.

I then told Brittany to get in the shower shave her pussy and do her make up. Cause my slaves need to be presentable when my lover gets here.

Tiffany arrived a little late. Brittany answered the door when she got here and tiffany knowing that Brittany was to be humiliated and had to obey gave handed her two packages and told her to put them up they where for later and to hurry back with a drink for her asap. Tiffany then entered my bedroom.

She looking fucking hot and the outfit she was wearing was perfect she was wearing these really short work out shorts and a red bikini top and sandals. I knew she had picked this outfit for a reason back when we lived together Brittany had come over and been pissed she was wearing that around me. Now she was coming over to fuck me right in front of her and she was gonna be a good little bitch about it.

I offered tiffany the breakfast Brittany had not been able to eat yet and she took it. And said she couldn't wait to get even with Brittany. So she would love to eat her breakfast. Right then Brittany walked in with Tiffany's drink upon seeing her eating her food she had a disappointed look but said nothing just brought her her drink then sat down on the bed. Tiffany shot her a death glare and said get your ass off that bed!! He is my man till I leave so keep your ugly fat ass away unless I say otherwise. Your lucky you even get to fucking watch you little slut. I smiled tiffany was doing great. Brittany got off the bed looked around said sorry mistress and sat on the floor. I thought to myself wow I programmed that into her well.

Tiffany put the food down and crossed the room to my bed as she did she removed her top giving me a full look at her small pink nipples.I was already rock hard watching this and Tiffany reached out and grabbed my cock thru my jeans then started unbuttoning them I responded by hooking my thumbs on either side and under both her shorts and panties then pulled them down to her ankles in one motion revealing her bald pink mound she stepped out of them and kicked my jeans and boxers aside then stepped into bed with me as she removed my shirt. We lay their exploring each others body for a few minutes before Tiffany looked me in the eye and said you wanna see what I brought for our entertainment? She then looked at Brittany and said go get those packages I came in with its time for us to teach you your role bitch.

Brittany disappeared from the room and returned less then a minute later holding two packages. Tiffany told Brittany to hand me the small box and to put on the clothes that where in the big box. I opened the small box and found it to be a remote then Brittany pulled out the items in her box and found it to be a strangely shaped pair of panties and a bra that had a key spot in each Brittany started changing into the outfit while tiffany explained that once she tightened the key down Brittany would have no access to her pussy therefore not being able to get herself off. She also explained that my remote allowed me to simulate either pain or pleasure to her pussy or tits when ever I wanted.

I laughed as Tiffany tightened Brittany's chastity device. Tiffany then return to my bed this time I took her and laid her down below me it was time to get this show on the road I brought her here for me to fuck now I needed to take that shit. I pressed her legs apart and lowered myself into her tiffany moaned with pleasure and Brittany let out and small whimper I looked over and seen her rubbing her panties but you could tell for the way she was getting irritated and frazzled that the panties where doing their job good cause she was obviously not getting any release. I started speeding up fucking Tiffany's till I had a good rhythm going. Then I felt Tiffany's grip on me tighten and her wrap her legs around my back and start pulling me into her as hard as she could. then I felt her shudder she was orgasming I spend up even more till I felt that familiar feeling that signaled my coming orgasm then I drove deep into her and blew my load in her.

Tiffany started to freak out and said she was not on birth control I laughed and said it's OK I have the perfect solution. I looked over at Brittany sitting on the floor at the foot of the bed like a obedient dog. And said Brittany get up here and make yourself useful lick my lover clean. Then get back in your place on the floor. As I sat back and watched I could not help but think that I needed to get her a dog collar and maybe a cage and water and food bowl. After all making her act like a dog was my next fantasy. But whatever I did I knew I had only started enjoying the things I could do to Brittany.",,2025-08-15T19:20:01.978256,2528,

The noise of my nightstick hitting the sturdy wooden door was loud enough to cut through all the sound. I rolled my eyes, nipples stiff in the freezing fucking November air. I was a quarter-past pissed-off to be responding to a goddamn domestic at three in the fucking morning. Why couldn't people have the common decency to beat their wives during daylight hours?

I found myself hoping that the asshole inside would be belligerent, that I'd have an excuse to fly some heads or kick some ass, something to help me warm up and vent some of this rage at being called out to do this close to the end of my shift. I was about to be disappointed.

""Who is it?"" a male voice called through the door.

""It's the police. Open up."" I shot back.

""Don't you need a warrant or something?"" He asked.

""Not with probable cause, Sir. Your neighbors called with a noise complaint, the sounds of a struggle, a screaming woman. That's more than enough for me to have the right to kick this door down or call SWAT on your ass if I want. Now OPEN UP.""

""Alright Officer, I don't want any trouble.""

He opened the door, letting me see inside. There were some signs of a serious struggle; paintings that had clearly been knocked from walls, couch cushions tossed in all directions, a big flat-screen T.V. resting on its back. It looked like the place had been tossed with them inside. His lower half was wrapped in a towel, revealing a pretty nice torso, but his hair didn't have the wetness of a shower.

I stormed in, hand gripping my club tighter as I kept one eye on him and the other looking for his victim.

""Where is she!?"" I asked, not waiting for an answer as I stalked deeper into the house.

""Officer, I—I..."" He didn't seem to know what to say, so I left his stupid dangling mouth and found my way to the master bedroom.

It was the smell that hit me first; like someone had just murdered a fresh pussy and put it away wet. My eyes got confirmation of the scene, a slender woman naked on a bed, her eyes all slitty with fatigue, her cunt visibly gaped wide. She did have some of the bruising of a domestic; except these weren't the marks of a knuckle or belt, this woman had been flogged with a dildo, or possibly even a cock, though it would have to be a big one.

She blinked and focused on me a bit, her voice raspy, ""Wh-who are you?""

""Primrose. Officer Pamela Primrose, though the other cops just tend to call me 'Stacks'.""

She sat up, ""What are you doing here?""

""Your neighbors heard you screaming. What's the matter bitch?"" I leaned down close to her face, ""can't you just bite a pillow or something when this loser is giving you dick?""

I cocked a thumb over my shoulder at the man who'd followed me into the bedroom.

""I have a name,"" he said, sounding a bit stung, then added, ""I'm Erik. And she's Melissa.""

""Well Erik and Melissa, thanks so much for wasting my fucking time, tonight."" I holstered my club and began to stomp towards the door, but on my way I accidentally stepped on Erik's towel, dropping it to the floor. Eric wasn't the only one that gasped, my eyes were captivated by the sensational piece of meat that hung—and I do mean HUNG—between his legs, swinging a little from the momentum. It was thick like the club I'd just abandoned and clearly had some give to it not being all the way hard.

I looked to his giant cock, then to the mosquito-bite tits Melissa was packing, then back to that cock. I put my hands on my hips, ""Well this is just a fucking WASTE! How in the hell does a negative a-cup like you end up with a piece of grade-A pork-meat like this!?""

""What?"" Melissa and Erik said as one. ""And from what your neighbors are reporting you can't even take it properly anyway!""

Erik was scrambling to replace the towel but I snatched it from him and threw it in Melissa's face. While she struggled to get it off I took my cuffs out and moved to her like a wolf striking down its prey,

""You're not under arrest so there are no Miranda rights to read you...instead I'm going to give you your Melissa rights.""

She gave a squeaky little shriek as I flipped her over and cuffed her arms behind her back, then dragged her to a chair in the corner of the room, making her sit facing the bed.

""You DO have the right to remain silent,"" I picked up her discarded panties and bunched them up, cramming them into her mouth. Erik moved on me to try and resist but I tangled his arm up and pushed him to the bed, making his naked form trip and sprawl out; I hadn't even looked at him to do it.

I used the towel next, tying it through the cuffs to the legs of the chair; she was totally immobilized now. I began to unbutton my uniform next.

""You have the right to sit there and watch while a real woman fucks your real man husband better than you ever could.""

She squeaked again on her panties as I revealed my massive G-cups, not to mention the nicely toned form I worked on to keep on top of the bad guys.

""You have the right to get smothered by my big fat titties,"" I taunted as I grabbed the back of her hair and pulled her into my tits, rubbing her face in my superiority both metaphorically and physically.

I turned, bodily pushing Erik back down onto the bed again; he was probably strong enough to resist me, but I had leverage and the element of surprise on him at every turn. With him pinned back down I straddled him and moved down for a dominant, nasty kiss, sucking his tongue with all the lust that big dick had inspired.

I pulled back afterwards, cupping his face in my hands, keeping it just inches from my huge boobs, ""Alright Erik, here's how this is gonna go. I'm gonna do you so good it blows your goddamned mind. You're gonna admit that I'm a better fuck right here in front of your wife, and if you don't let me I'll slap you two in the klink for noise violations. Is that clear?""

Erik's eyes went wide, but I didn't let him answer as I slid low in the bed, dropping down between his legs to get acquainted with that monstrous appendage of his. Up close there was no denying the glory of the thing; it was long and thick and wreathed with veins, it had a nice fat head on it and his balls were big too, making it all match nicely. I cupped those while I went to work on his head, slurping and sucking around it, not taking it all the way into my mouth yet, but using my thick lips to let him know what that might feel like.

I didn't have to work that big knob long before he was precumming right into my mouth a bit, the salty-sweet taste of him only encouraging me to go crazier on him. I pulled back a moment and looked his wife right in the eyes, holding his cock like a weapon in my fist,

I pulled the panties from her mouth, ""Alright bitch, how often do you take this bad-boy to the balls in your throat?""

She gawped at me a moment, ""Don't be ridiculous,"" she answered, ""That's impossible! Look how long he is!""

I grinned wickedly and took the plunge, slurping all nine inches of his fatness into my mouth and then my throat; I won't lie or brag, the damned thing was big and it made me gag just a little bit as I forced it in, but I was tough and sound myself looking Melissa right in the eyes with his nuts on my chin when I was done.

She flushed in what was either embarrassment or rage—I didn't really give a shit—and pouted as I began to move my head up and down, throating and un-throating the monster over and over again, reflexively tearing up a little as I bobbed and bounced.

After a few minutes of that I could feel his cock literally quiver-throb with hardness and he groaned, letting me know I should stop if I didn't want to lose the chance to ride this beast, so I did, his huge head bursting from my mouth in a torrent of drool and precum, my chin an absolute mess of the stuff. Slowly I stroked him, making sure he wouldn't spunk off until I was ready as I looked at her,

""Your boyfriend's dick is fucking huge you stupid bitch,"" I explained, ""and I can't believe he chose to settle for an ironing board like you when he could have had a proper pair this whole time!""

I punctuated my remarks by wrapping my giant globes around his giant pole, slowly wanking him off between them, milking him for more precum that spat from his cock in dollops, spurts, and streams, staining my tits to perfection. I had to slow down again, making sure he wouldn't lose it.

""Do you see the look on his face? Dude's in ecstasy!"" I said to her, ""You need to titfuck him if you want this kind of reaction... Oh oops, you can't, your boobs aren't nearly big enough. Oh well!"" I taunted her viciously, giving my own pair another shake before I went back to deep-throating him a few bobs. When I pulled back again I gave his poor balls some attention; I was torturing them by bringing him to the brink over and over, it was only fair I thank them for the restraint.

I kissed, licked, and sucked on those bad boys in turn, rolling them around my slobbery mouth before cinching them up and taking both at once.

""Oh god, you fit them both!"" he groaned in shocked delight, giving me evidence of the fact that Melissa clearly couldn't do the same; I gave her the finger as I slurped the fat pair deep enough to briefly gargle them, then came away to just admire my handiwork, his throbbing pork-pillar a testament to my fine skill at pleasuring a big cock.

""Why are you doing this!?"" Melissa sobbed as I rubbed his dick all over the soft skin of my face.

I could only cackle in delight with my answer, ""Because your man has a huge cock and he deserves proper service. The real question is why don't YOU do this?""

""I fuck him real good!"" she protested.

That only made me grin bigger, ""Not like this you don't!"" I smugly declared as I reared up and just mounted that fat fucker.

For a very brief moment, I suddenly had sympathy for Melissa. I'd been summoned here on a noise complaint... and when his big dickhead first gaped me open I understood why. I bit my lip, determined not to betray the amount of sheer over-stuffed pleasure I was feeling and squealed loud, squirting just a little bit onto his big nuts as I began to bounce on his dick.

""Please! Please officer, not in front of Melissa! Not like this!"" he begged, bucking a bit beneath me as he tried to sit up. That bucking only made it all feel better and I grabbed his wrists, pinning them hard against the mattress as I moaned out my delight, spilling out more gooshy juices all over him.

""She needs to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!"" I told him as I dropped my tits in his face and worked my hips, cunt pumping his dick hard like a fist as I move him in and out.

""What?"" he groaned, uncomprehending as I bounced and bobbed, tits boobs clapping together lewdly as twerked my ass up and down his huge, rigid length, bringing huge cries of pleasure from both of us. He was saying something, but his words were almost entirely lost in my huge boobs, smacking and smothering his face as I rode his cock like a show-pony.

""You know what! Say it! She needs to hear it!"" I commanded, pulling back so he could be heard, ""Tell her how good this cunt is!""

""That's my girlfriend!"" he sobbed in pleasure and torment, pleading with me to not make him say it.

I paused, turning to look her dead in the face, my expression calm and superior, not moving at all.

""Oh god, I need to cum!"" he cried, but I just reached down and grabbed him by the balls, keeping him from thrusting and refusing to bounce on him in turn.

""You want to cum? Say it. You know what she needs to hear. I you know what I want.""

He struggled with me, his hands uselessly groping my tits and trying to work my hips, but I held him on the edge, unwilling to give him the sweet release he so desperately needed. Finally he sighed in defeat and I could feel his lovely muscles utterly deflate beneath me in vanquished agony.

""She's better than you, Melissa,"" he said, ""Her ass is sexier, her tits are bigger, and her cunt is like I've stuck my cock right into fucking heaven."" His girlfriend visibly shrank at his words, tears brimming in her eyes as she recognized her sheer inferiority to me.

""Why?"" she managed, voice on the edge of full-on bawling.

""Because your boyfriend's cock is huge and you're unworthy of it,"" I explained simply enough. Then I was bucking my hips again, but this time at five times the speed I'd been doing before. He was totally unprepared; he had no idea how much I'd been holding back and as my cunt turbo-pumped his cock, his balls tightened right up and he began to spew his huge load inside of me.

""OH FUUUUUUCK SO GOOOOOOOOOD!"" he cried.

But I wasn't looking to take his whole load, I swiftly pulled off and aimed his gigantic cum-cannon at his subdued girlfriend.

""TASTE IT!"" I commanded, ""Witness the biggest load of your boyfriend's whole life!"" I milked him and milked him, dropping a hand to massage and coax those big nuts through his orgasm, his dick throbbing as it spat out wad after rope after splat of boiling white nastiness all over Melissa's face and tiny tits. Her eyes got wide around the eighth shot and huge around the fourteenth; I made sure to aim his final five shots right into them though, so she closed them in spunk-blindness, totally owned by the sperm barrage I'd brought to her.

Erik groaned and sighed, relaxing in post-orgasmic bliss as I moved to Melissa, lewdly licking the spunk right off of her, long slow dominant licks that showed her how much I owned her now.

""You have the right to cry yourself to sleep,"" I said when I was done, unlocking the handcuffs, then continued,

""you have the right to try and fail to please your boyfriend's dick as I just did. You have the right to be a flat-chested, inferior little bitch who's going to call 911 yourself to try and get me to come back and fuck your boyfriend properly. You have the right to suck your boyfriend's big nuts when I'm deepthroating him and to eat his ass while I ride his cock. Anything you say is irrelevant.""

There was a long, long pause as I began to get my underwear and uniform back on.

""Yes ma'am,"" she finally said.",,2025-08-15T19:20:10.422477,2653,

Chapter 2

Her skin is actually very soft. Maybe it's all the sulfur fumes in hell, good for the skin, sort of like the water in a hotspring. Or maybe she's a soulless hellbeast engineered to manipulate us with her beauty. One of those.

""A little lower, elf,"" she says while I wash her stomach, as if she's suddenly in charge of anything.

""Master instructed me to bathe you, not to follow your orders,"" I say as curtly as I can.

""You'll have to get there eventually, you know. Just make sure you're thorough,"" her eyes dance over me, ""I'm awfully dirty.""

Defiantly, I make sure I move up, not down with the sponge, swallowing hard when I realize I just got a handful of tit. Their definitely real, not that I expect there's a lot of boob jobs in hell. But they look a little too perfect, and feeling how jiggly and soft they are just kind of pisses me off.

Naturally, she groans as I wash them, as if just to annoy me further, ""You're good with your hands.""

""I take all my work seriously,"" I take the pitcher and pour water to rinse her breasts off. It's... quite a sight. I wonder if her nipples are always erect like that because she's a succubus, or if she's actually turned on right now. Impossible to tell.

""Clearly. Especially on women, I take it. I mean, that's why you haven't satisfied your master, right? You're not into men?"" she clearly tries to provoke me.

I respond by pouring the pitcher of water on her head, ""I have to wash your hair.""

She moves to allow me access. Somehow her head being wet makes her hotter.

""Did I strike a chord? I'm sorry, I genuinely thought you were a lesbian,"" she takes in a slow breath through her nose, ""After all, I'm not the only one who's wet in here.""

She's... not wrong. My crotch is still soaked, and my clit throbs a little each time I touch her. As if I wasn't pent up already.

""No, I am not a lesbian,"" I start firmly working shampoo into her hair.

""But... you do like women too, yes?""

""I serve whatever my human master or mistress needs,"" not that it's any of her business.

""So is he not your first owner?"" she leans back, getting closer than I appreciate.

""If you must know, I served master's aunt for many years,"" I tell her, ""She had no children, so when she passed, she left her estate, myself included, to her favorite nephew. I have been his for less than a year.""

""So... not long, but still long enough that you could have satisfied him hundreds of times by now. Did you serve his aunt as a proper- Ouch!"" she growls, looking back.

""Sorry, you had a tangle,"" I say, not bothering to feign sincerity, ""And again, if you must know, I did serve his aunt in every way expected of an elf.""

""That isn't taking credence from my lesbian theory,"" she's greeted with another pitcher-full of water to the head.

""Master has merely not asked for my sexual services yet. When that time comes, I will gladly do so,"" aaand, there's only one place left to wash. I sigh, ""Lean back.""

""Yet, you say,"" she gives that smug grin again and leans against the edge of the tub and spreads her legs, ""But what kind of man summons a succubus when he has an elf girl? I mean, probably not one who intends to use the elf girl, I'd imagine.""

That's it bitch, provoke me when I'm about to handle your genitals, ""Who master chooses to give and not give his attention to is not up to us, it's entirely his prerogative.""

I reach down between her legs, starting to rub the sponge between her buttocks, to which she responds with an irritating satisfied growl.

""Precisely, but what I'm saying is that he clearly is not so interested in giving it to you. At least not at first. Maybe not ever. Does that bother you?""

My jaw sets in. Maintain your composure, Lorelei. You need it now.

I move my hands upwards and find her pussy in the soapy water. Just like her nipples, her clit and labia are engorged as if she's ready to go. And her pussy is hot. Like, really hot. It's noticeably warmer than the hot water it's soaking in. I rub the outside with the sponge, then gingerly start to work in her folds. She licks her lips and shudders. Not making this easier.

""You're quiet, does that mean it does? Are you troubled, knowing your master's first time will be with me? That you'll stay in your little belt while I slide down on his cock. Again, and again,"" she's really pushing it, ""If you want, I could ask him if you could at least watch. I mean, we're basically sisters now, so I don't mind helping you out.""

I wonder if demons need to breath. Like, say, if I held her head under the water till the bubbles stopped, what would the result be?

""Master has you on strict denial of sexual touching for now,"" I remind, scrubbing roughly against her exposed pussy, which unfortunately only results in her shuddering and moaning.

""You say that, but look where your hands are. He sent his little elf girl to make sure I was nice and clean down there, didn't he?"" she licks her lips again and stares at me, ""If you want, you can keep going. After all, you care about your master's pleasure, and you'd want to make sure I'm nice and ready, so it feels the best for him.

I pull my hands away, ""I'm done. Stand up so I can dry you off.""

""Aww, so soon? A shame. But then, the sooner I get out, the sooner I can get back to master,"" she stands up and steps out of the tub, and I try to ignore how gorgeous her body is as it glistens.""

""Like I said, master has you on denial, so don't expect much,"" I start wiping her down, from horns to hooves.

""Am I being denied? Or is he? There's been plenty of men who thought they could resist me before. None of them lasted more than a day,"" that smug look as she watches me clean her. Yep, should've drowned her in the tub.

""My... aura, is stronger on men. Whatever you're feeling right now, it's probably tenfold for him. That cock just has to be aching. I bet he's in his room masturbating to thoughts of me right now. Getting the quick one out before he takes me, so he can last and enjoy me for as long as he likes,"" she gets a little breathy as she speaks of him, and I get progressively more murdery.

""There are clothes that should fit you on your bed,"" I say, holding back a shout.

""Thank you dear, I appreciate your... service,"" she leans in and grabs me by the neck, kissing me hard with some of the softest, hottest lips I've ever felt. Her slick, long tongue dives deep past my own lips, but might as well be on my clit, because I nearly come right there in my belt.

She pulls back and walks off with a devious giggle, the click of her hooves echoing against the floor, and leaving me catching my breath.",,2025-08-15T19:20:18.769466,1260,

Wife hires a private investigator to find out if her husband is cheating. Then, after discovering that he is cheating on her, she hires a gypsy witch to make a special potion for her penis shrinking revenge.

Obviously not wanting to be seen by anyone, being cautiously careful, Jimmy raised his coat collar to cover the sides of his face. The vindictive, jealous, possessive bitch that his wife was, he knew what his wife would do if she ever caught him stepping out on her. Besides, with dollar signs in her eyes every time she looked at him, she didn't love him. She never loved him. She loved his money. Money, money, money, it was all about money with her.

As if he was a hit man about to make a hit, he quickly and quietly turned off the sidewalk to climb the six steps to Barbie's front door. Easily recognizable for those who knew him, he looked like a supersized Tom Cruise. Somehow making himself appear smaller than his 6'5"" height, he dropped his head and slouched his posture. As if he was carrying heavy bags, he lowered his broad shoulders and stooped. Nonetheless, a very big and physically fit man, it was hard for him to hide his wide, muscular back. He was one who could never disappear in a crowd.

Impatient to gain entry to Barbie's apartment, as if pushing a button on a water game at the carnival to win a prize, he pressed her doorbell over and again. As if trying to hurry an elevator along, he rang her front door bell with anxiousness. In the horny mood he was in, hoping not to be disappointed and sexually frustrated, he hoped she was home. Never coming to her without an appointment, he hoped he didn't surprise her too much. He hoped she didn't turn him away. With her as beautiful as she was popular, he hoped she wasn't there with someone.

He'd hate to come all this way for nothing. He'd hate to have to go through his day feeling sexually on edge without having Barbie give him a much needed sexual release. He needed to see his beloved Barbie. He needed to bend her over her table and fuck her. He needed to see her poised on her knees in front of him while staring up at him and blowing him. He needed to cum in her beautiful mouth and watch her swallow his cum.

With him arriving at this early morning hour, maybe she's still sleeping. Maybe she had a late night on the town last night. Yet, with yesterday Sunday and not Saturday, he didn't think she'd be out late partying on a Sunday. As far as he knew, she still went to church. As far as he knew, as if she was a modern day Mary Magdalene, she still prayed for her damned soul. Nonetheless, he should have called her but he wanted to surprise her. Besides, he had a little surprise to give her.

Being that he had a rule not to shit where he eats, if Barbie wasn't home, he didn't want to feel horny enough and compelled enough that he needed to have sex with one of his employees in the stockroom again. Those days were long gone since he met Barbie. Having fired all of the employees he had sex with before, he'd rather that no one know he was a lecher. He'd rather that no one know that he was just another immoral, older man missing his youth and going through the change of life by cheating on his wife with a younger woman.

With Barbie nearly half his age and young enough to be his daughter, sometimes he felt perverted and other times he felt blessed. Yet, he knew if it wasn't for the money he generously gave her, she'd never have sex with him. If only he was ten years younger and if only he wasn't married, he'd ask her to marry him. He loved her, he truly loved her enough to ask her to be his wife.

With this only Monday, he was too horny to wait until his scheduled appointment on Thursday. One accustomed to always getting his own way, even that wasn't part of their agreement, he expected her to be at his beck and call. Once accustomed to not showing much emotion, especially when in a sexual relationship, he sighed his sexually excited relief when he heard Barbie's voice over the intercom. He never realized how much he missed her until her heard her sweet voice. He never knew how much he loved her until he thought she wouldn't be there.

""Hello? Who is it?""

Who is it? Who did she think it was at this early hour of the morning? He wondered if she was expecting someone else for an early morning quickie. He didn't figure that any of her clients who worked a nine to five job for a living could afford her. She wasn't the typical ten, twenty, or one-hundred-dollar prostitute standing on the corner.

Even though she charged a lot less per hour than the not as good looking and not as sexy broads on Madison, Seventh, and Park Avenues, she was still too high priced of a call girl for the average Joe. Besides, someone who looked like her, would never settle for an average Joe no matter how much he offered to pay her for sex. She was too classy and more selective than that. In the way that Billie Joel had his uptown girl with Christie Brinkley, Barbie was Jimmy's downtown girl.

### TallBlondeBustyBlueEyedBimbo ###

Hoping that no one recognized him, while impatiently standing outside of her front door, Jimmy kept his head down and looked straight ahead when he heard people walking by behind him. Needing to remain discreet, it would be just his luck to have one of his wife's friends or business associates catch him in this part of town. He'd literally and figuratively have Hell to pay if his wife found out about Barbie.

The last thing he wanted was for her to find out about his extramarital affairs. The last thing he wanted was to be involved in a messy divorce. The last thing he wanted was to give his wife a huge chunk of his wealth in a divorce settlement. The last thing he wanted was trouble when he only wanted a good, sexual time with his paid by the hour, mistress Barbie.

With his wife, Donna, on so very many committees and involved in so very many charities, she had friends everywhere and they all liked to gossip, speculate, and spread rumors and innuendoes about him cheating on her. If only they knew the real him, with all of his sexual antics the truth, he'd have plenty of gossip to tell and none of it were speculations, rumors and innuendoes. To be seen was the last thing he wanted. He didn't want to be caught on this side of town. With him not owning any property but for Barbie's secret apartment, he had no reason to be here. He couldn't even think of an explanation why he'd be this far from home and/or from the office.

""It's Jimmy,"" he said with an impatient laugh. ""Who do you think it is at this early hour of the morning? ""Or were you expecting someone else?""""

Unable to hold his tongue, he voiced his jealousy and possessiveness. He could have used the key that he had to her front door but he didn't want to frighten her by just climbing the stairs and showing up at her apartment door. Besides, not wanting to embarrass her, what if she was with someone? The last thing he needed to see was some John kissing her goodbye at her front door. If someone rubbed their sexual relationship with her in his face, he'd beat them to a pulp before launching them down four flights of stairs.

Having become as romantically attached as he was sexually attached to the woman, he was embarrassed that his jealousy and possessiveness was suddenly showing. Deep emotions that he should feel but didn't feel for his wife, he felt in spades for his mistress. He knew Barbie was seeing other men but that was okay with him as long as she made time for him and didn't infringe on his time. As long as her other clients used condoms, especially when he never did, he had no claim on her. He could definitely get her to commit to him as being his steady mistress, his girlfriend, his fiancée, or even his wife, but that would cost him much more than what he was doling out to her now.

""Jimmy? What are you doing here? What time is it? What day is this? Fuck! Is it Thursday already? Oh, my God.""

He looked at his watch, an oversized 70 mm, Invicta Sea Hunter that looked better and much more expensive than a Rolex Submariner for a fraction of the price. He liked getting bargains and he was certainly getting a bargain with Barbie for setting her up in this low end apartment. Now that he knew she was home, he just wanted to get inside. He just hoped she was alone. He really needed to have sex with her. He needed to fuck her and have her suck him.

""It's a little past eight and it's Monday,"" he said with a laugh.

She yawned her tiredness over the intercom.

""Dear God,"" she said. ""It's so early, too early,"" she said with a laugh. ""I haven't even had my coffee yet. I haven't even put on my face. You're going to see me without my makeup,"" she said putting her hands to her cheeks. ""Would you like coffee? I have hazelnut.""

Afraid of being seen and getting caught by someone his wife knew, he rattled her doorknob.

""Just let me in Barbie. C'mon,"" he said. ""It's okay if I see you without your makeup. You're still beautiful inside and out with or without make up. Now, buzz me.""

There were more people coming in both directions obviously going to work. Fearing that people in the neighborhood knew what she did for a living, he really didn't want to be seen standing on a call girl's stoop in broad daylight by anyone he knew.

""I wasn't expecting you until later in the week,"" she said.

Now with her stalling, he wondered if she was with someone.

""Donna's on her way to pick up her sister in Scarsdale to go shopping for the day and I was horny? I'd thought I'd stop by for a quickie,"" he said with a long sigh while waiting for her to buzz him inside. Even though he was paying her, he felt guilty that he was using her for sex when he had real feelings for her. ""Is this a bad time?""

He was hoping she wouldn't turn him away. He needed a quick release and she was just the doll who could give him what he emotionally wanted and what he sexually needed.

""No, this isn't a bad time. I'm still in my nightgown,"" she said with a sexy laugh. ""Come in. Come upstairs,"" she said buzzing him inside.

Wishing she lived on the first floor or had an elevator, Jimmy climbed the four flights of stairs with his 40-year-old legs. He made a mental note to move her to a better place on the better side of town. He made a mental note to move her to a place that had an elevator and a doorman that he could slip a few dollars to keep tabs on her. This side of town wasn't a safe place for his baby.

Only if he moved her to a better address, she'd have wealthier clients and he'd be paying her more for her time than the lousy five hundred bucks he gave her a week, every week for the past year. If he moved her to a better address, she may even find her dream man and he'd lose her forever. If he moved her to a better address, one closer to his home and business, more of a risk of being caught, his wife may inadvertently stumble over her.

He hit the lottery when he hooked up with her. He figured a high class call girl earned one thousand to two thousand dollars an hour. Right now, an undiscovered gem, he felt that he was getting a bargain with her, especially when he usually hung out with her for a few hours for the same fee. He like getting bargains. Not that he was cheap, he wasn't but, careful with his money, he like paying less for more.

Yet, with this a rough neighborhood, God forbid something should happen to her. He'd never forgive himself if she was robbed, beaten, raped, or murdered. Sometimes he worried about her as a father would worry over his daughter instead a client who'd never worry over his paid for sex lover. He'd have his realtor make some inquiries on his behalf. Besides, liking the idea already of moving her closer, if he moved her from the Bronx to New York City, he could see her more often.

### TallBlondeBustyBlueEyedBimbo ###

She was so young. She was so beautiful. She was so sexy. She was so tall. One of a kind, assuredly one in a million, she could have worked as a runway model. Yet, with all of the competition that there was in New York, having sex for money was much easier than running around town trying to get modeling work while advancing a modeling career. With women starting their modeling careers at 15-years-old to 17-years-old, and many retiring in their late twenties, and with her having no modeling experience and/or a portfolio, she was too late to an already competitive party.

With her very sexually accommodating to her credit, she was so willing to do any sexual thing that he wanted her to do. She never said no to whatever he sexually wanted. He liked thinking that she liked him for more than the money he gave her but, realistic about their sex for money arrangement, he knew better than that. Something he wasn't free to do, he knew one day that some young stud would scoop her up and marry her and give her a brood of kids. She was too beautiful, too kind, too caring, and too loving not to marry and settle down with one man someday.

Twenty-four-year-old Barbie stood in the hall and in her nightgown at her opened front door waiting for him to ascend the last flight of stairs, his personal stairway to Heaven. As if she had sprouted wings, the light shining behind her illuminated her as if she was his vision of an angel. With her golden blonde hair capturing the light, she looked as if she was wearing a halo.

As if she was standing in front of an open refrigerator door with the kitchen light off, her sheer, thin nightgown was completely transparent. As if she was standing in front of a big screen TV with the living room light off, he could count her pussy hairs if she had any but she was shaved. As if she was standing in front of a bay window and opened the drapes to greet a sunshine filled day, she looked like an angel wearing only gauze.

With the light coming from her kitchen and passing through her nightgown into the hall, she looked as if she was standing there naked. He liked the sexy vision of seeing her while imagining her without wearing any clothes, especially when she wasn't naked. He wished he could show her off to all of his friends and his family but they'd never appreciate a whore in the way that he appreciated her. They'd never understand his involvement nor his attachment to her and for her. No doubt, they'd look down at her with disdain while his friends would love nothing more than to have sex with her too.

With sex getting in the way as it did with Julia Roberts playing Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman, they couldn't possibly see the good person and beautiful woman she was. Only, she was more than his whore, she was special to him and he hoped he was special to her too. No matter how much time he spent with her, it was never enough. Wishing he could run away with her to some deserted tropical island, he couldn't get his fill of her. Something he never felt with his wife, as soon as he left her, he missed her. Only, with his life too impossibly complicated, he wished he could be with her all of the time.

""Hi, Baby,"" she said wrapping her long, slim arms around his neck while pressing her shapely torso tightly against him to give him a long, wet kiss.

With her sucking out what little breath he had left, he broke off the kiss to huff and puff his weariness from climbing four flights of stairs.

""I need to move you to a better place that has an elevator. This four story walk up reminds me of that old movie, Barefoot in the Park with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda but they had five stories,"" he said with a laugh.

With sex getting in the way and with Jimmy missing all of the cues, obvious in the way she looked at him with love, Barbie wanted to be more than just his kept mistress and fuck buddy. In the way that their differences in age did, money got in the way of love. With him paying her rent too, it obviously bothered her that she accepted money from the man she loved for sex but she needed the money for the other necessities of life, food, clothes, and toiletries. He had no idea that Barbie loved him and would marry him if only he asked and if only he wasn't already married.

Only, as far as Jimmy was concerned, it was one thing to have a 24-year-old lover but another thing to have a 24-year-old wife. With his son graduating high school next year, Barbie was closer in age to his son than she was to him. Besides, if ever he divorced his wife, especially for a woman who looked like Barbie and was as young as she was, his wife would hire the best divorce attorneys and take him to the cleaners.

He had a lot of skeletons in his closet that they'd uncover and discover with just a little bit of digging. Everything from secret bank accounts, to cheating on his taxes, to money laundering, and to having a myriad of secret, sexual affairs with his wife's sister and her friends, a costly divorce would ruin him. Worth the risk of losing everything for her, Barbie made him happy. If he had to choose, he'd pick Barbie over money.

""Oh, Barbie, you remind me of Tom Brady's wife, Gisele, but with tits, big tits,"" he said.

With Gisele her idol, he knew his compliment would enliven her, not that she needed any encouragement to brighten her disposition. Never sad or depressed, she was always cheery and enthusiastic when he was the grumpy one. He gave her a long, lustful look before grabbing her breasts through her nightgown with both hands and squeezing. He slowly slid his thumbs over her already erect nipples. Oozing sexuality, Barbie practically cooed when he told her that she looked like her idol, Gisele.

""Seriously. Be honest. Don't lied to me. Do you really think I look like Gisele?""

Assuming the pose as if she was about to walk the runway, as if pretending she was Gisele on a dance floor, she twirled around as if she was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars.

""You look better than Gisele. She has big, horse like facial features, you don't,"" he said. ""If Tom Brady ever met you, he'd leave Gisele for you.""

She not only smiled but she swooned and practically melted in his arms with his compliments. Able to bridge the 16-year difference in age, they were good together. If someone saw them from afar, they'd know they were lovers, boyfriend and girlfriend, or even husband and wife.

""How are you? I missed you, Jimmy,"" said Barbie looking at him with love while he looked at her with lust.

Jimmy wrapped his arm around Barbie's slim waist and kicked her door closed. He kissed her with passion while sliding down a slow hand to grab a handful of her round, firm ass through her pale blue, short, sheer, low cut, cotton nightgown. He gave her a smirk.

""Missed me? You missed my money, you mean,"" he said laughing and reaching in his pocket to pull out and lay five, crisp, one-hundred dollar bills on her kitchen table.

Barbie scooped up the money and tucked it in a jar she kept on the table.

""Just as you always want sex, I can always use money,"" she said with a little, embarrassed laugh. Even though she worked as a call girl, she always felt awkward taking money for sex, especially from him. ""So tell me. What do you want?"" As if she didn't know already. ""How can I relieve your horniness?"" She slowly slid her hand down the length of his already hard eight, inch cock while giving him a naughty look and a sexy smile.

Turning her and twisting her, Jimmy grabbed a handful of Barbie's long, blonde hair and pulled hard enough and long enough to bend her forward.

""You know what I want. He lifted her nightgown to expose her bare ass and walloped it hard to make her jump and gasp. Yet, by the sexually excited look on her face, she loved him slapping her shapely ass. He let go of her hair to unzip himself and to pull out his already erect prick. ""Assume the position, bitch. Give me what I'm paying you to get.""

As if she was Lee Holloway, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Secretary, assuming the position, Barbie leaned her 6' frame forward to put her palms and elbows on her table and spread her long legs wide. Jimmy spit in his hand and ran it the length of Barbie's naked, shaved pussy. There was no need for him to wet her. She was already wet enough. As if he was fucking his own personal, not so private gloryhole, he inserted himself inside of her with a hard hump.",,2025-08-15T19:20:49.898578,3796,

NOT A LACE GIRL, AFTER ALL

It was early. Cassie stepped out of the shower, her hair knotted up tightly in a bun to keep it dry. Wrapping a towel around her naked body, she went back into the bedroom and entered the walk-in wardrobe, hands moving quickly in the top drawer, betraying the nervous excitement in her tummy.

Cassie found the leather bodice, hunted around for a pair of stockings, and then retrieved the tiny leather microskirt. Her fingers ran over the leather for a moment, feeling its suppleness and its strength. Not a lace girl, after all, she thought as she smiled to herself.

She dressed quickly, slipping the stockings over her skin and sliding the hooks into the eyes of the leather bodice, feeling the garment shaping her cleavage. Briefly, she debated the satin g-string. No point. Cassie wriggled her bottom into the tight leather microskirt and smoothed the material down neatly over her thighs, before slipping into a pair of black stilettos with a wickedly high heel.

Striding out of the wardrobe, she checked herself in the mirror. Cassie tugged at her hair, unravelling the bun and letting her styled-blonde locks cascade over her shoulders. The body in the mirror was toned, beautiful, a vision in leather and nylon. She felt assured, in control, and very horny. Time to get on with the day.

Cassie negotiated the stairs carefully, holding a bowl of water and a cloth in one hand. She could already feel the slickness building between her legs. Reaching the foot of the stairs, she turned towards the kitchen and then stopped. Beneath the stairs was a door. She curled her manicured fingers around the handle and pushed. The door opened with a click, revealing a set of narrow stairs leading down.

Cassie had to grab the handrail tightly as she teetered in her heels on the first step. Once she had her balance, she began to descend carefully, heels clicking on the wood, the water in the little bowl sloshing from side to side with each step.

At the bottom of the steps, Cassie took a moment to let her eyes adjust to the gloom. The basement was lit with early morning light from a couple of tiny strip windows set high in one wall. The floor had been cleared and a mattress laid down in the middle of the space. She could make out the figure, spread-eagled and silent, positioned just as she had left him.

""Hi baby.""

The head turned to look at her, but didn't speak. In the dim light, Cassie could make out the straps either side of his mouth, his lips parted in an 'O' shape around a black rubber ball. She crossed the floor and knelt down next to her husband.

""Sorry about the gag, but we don't want to wake the boys up. It's too early for them yet.""

Damian's bulk shifted, his arms pulling, but the ropes were too secure. He was helpless before her, spread on the mattress.

""Have you been waiting for me to come back?""

Cassie stroked his cheek, letting her hand wander down over his muscled chest, across his sculpted abdominals, to trail through the tight curls of his public hair. She raked her nails gently up his substantial erection, feeling the way his cock twitched at her touch.

""Let's get you clean.""

Cassie dipped the cloth into the bowl and began to wipe it over his rock-hard manhood, moving slowly up and down his shaft, rubbing the soft cotton over his purple, swollen tip. She could feel him shiver and pulse in her hand. Cassie squeezed, eliciting a moan from her husband. She continued to stroke him with the cloth, listening intently to the pattern of his breathing as she worked him up to the edge.

Cassie tore her gaze away from his engorged cock, turning to see the expression on his face. Damian was wide eyed, looking back at her with lust. A line of saliva trickled from the corner of his mouth across his cheek.

""I'm so glad we came to an understanding,"" Cassie said, her hand still working its way up and down his shaft. ""Lily would never have made you happy. Do you want me to let you cum?""

Damian nodded furiously, his eyes wild now, flicking from his wife's face, to her hand stroking his manhood with the wash cloth, then taking in her trim, supple body. She could see the need in his face, how close he was.

""All clean.""

Cassie dropped the cloth back into the bowl and picked up the cage. Damian began to shake his head, eyes pleading.

""Ssh. It's okay. You've had your exercise time, now back into prison.""

Damian bucked and heaved, but Cassie had done her job well. She could feel the power in his body as he tried to break free of the ropes, turning his abdomen to try and keep his cock away from his wife's hand. She grasped his shaft firmly and then began to push the steel cage down over his tip. She applied steady pressure, feeling his manhood begin to wither under the irresistible force she was applying. He shrank, despite his best efforts, until the cage met the steel ring that was still around his shaft and balls. Cassie pushed a little further, bringing the two parts together with a soft click. Damian slumped.

""There. All locked up again.""

Cassie watched as her husband began immediately to fill the confines of his cage, his cock desperate to break free. She stroked it gently, feeling her husband's warm flesh bulging through the cold, hard steel in her palm.

""You've been so good, after Lily. I'm thinking about reducing your sentence, giving you parole for good behaviour. Would you like that?""

Damian looked up at her.

""Oh, yes. Sorry darling.""

She bent over her husband, her hands sliding behind his head to unfasten the gag. Cassie tugged it out of his mouth and Damian licked his lips, stretching his jaw now that his mouth was freed.

""Yes,"" he said quietly, ""I'd like that.""

Cassie smiled, rubbing her husband's broad chest with her hand.

""Me too. I can't wait until we have all of this behind us.""

Cassie looked down at his cage.

""I'm sorry to keep you locked up, but well, you know,"" she smiled sweetly, ""There has to be a price to pay.""

Cassie bent over her husband and kissed him softly on the lips.

""It's hard on me too. I can't wait to have you inside me again. Just the thought of it....""

She straightened up. Damian remained silent.

""But in the meantime.""

Cassie pulled the microskirt up over her thighs, exposing her waxed crotch. She straddled her husband's chest and waited expectantly.

""There's just enough time before we have to get the boys up for school.""

Cassie closed her eyes and felt her husband's eager tongue slide inside her. Her thighs quivered in anticipation and....

The alarm went off. Cassie's eyes flicked open, blinking, disorientated. Her hand slid across the bed to her husband's side but found it empty. She squirmed, feeling the delicious heat between her legs, tangled in the bedsheets. She had a powerful urge to touch herself, to bring herself to the climax that had been so close in her dream. It would be so easy. Instead, she balled her hands up into fists, knotted in the sheets, until she regained her composure. No, that wouldn't do. Sitting up, she listened out for any indication of where Damian was.

The bedroom door was open and she heard a distant voice, high and agitated, followed by the low rumble of an adult. She glanced at the clock. Her family were downstairs having breakfast. Cassie flopped back down onto her pillows, groaning inwardly as she remembered: Saturday, a birthday party, grocery shopping, visiting her mother in the afternoon. The dream of her husband under her power began to fade, but her arousal was still burning.

Cassie showered quickly, but when she walked into the wardrobe afterwards, she stopped, her hand on her underwear drawer. Why not? The memory of Damian, tied and helpless looking up at her, came back strongly. Her desire peaked, remembering the way that he had disavowed Lily in the dream, because her had chosen his wife instead: his sexy, beautiful, adventurous, creative, wife. He had agreed to be locked up as a sign of his devotion to their marriage. It was a dream, absolutely, but why not take the first step? Why not let Damian know what she was becoming capable of? He needed to understand that there was more she could offer than his blonde slut ever could.

Smiling to herself, she pulled out the leather bodice and began to dress. It took a few moments, and Cassie felt her excitement building again as she relived her dream. Her only concession was a long maxi dress to cover her outfit, swapping the stilettoes for a pair of low heels. It was more practical, less to show in front of her children, just a hint of stockinged ankle on display for her husband to notice and wonder at. She fussed with her hair and then made her way downstairs.

Breakfast was in full swing. Damian was cooking pancakes for Sam and Charlie. He had them sitting quietly on two stools at the breakfast bar as he began to dish out. Damian saw her in the doorway and smiled. Cassie's heart fluttered, taking in the happy family scene in front of her.

""Just feeding the horde,"" he said. ""There are some here for you as well, if you want them.""

""Thanks, that sounds lovely.""

Damian nodded, passing Sam the maple syrup.

""If you like, I can take them to the birthday. I don't mind,"" he offered.

Cassie paused, enjoying the moment. She could still feel the sexual tension in her core, but it was changing now, turning into a warm glow. There would be plenty of time later.

""I'll get the presents,"" she called.

Cassie turned and went to the door under the stairs. She hesitated for a moment and then opened it. There were no stairs leading down, there was no basement, nor mattress. There were just shelves. Cassie took the birthday present from the shelf and closed the door, the last vestiges of the dream evaporating.

No ropes. But there could be. The future was full of possibilities.

---

Cassie stacked the plates in the dishwasher, crouching down to reach the bottom tray. She could feel the tightness of the skirt around her thighs, hidden under the long cotton dress. Her knees rubbed as she clamped her thighs together, relishing the naughty thrill that coursed through her groin. She could feel the friction of her stockings against the dress. Maybe she should have worn the g-string; maybe having her crotch uncovered was a tactical mistake if she was going to keep feeling these little flushes of excitement throughout the day.

She stood up, smoothing down the dress, feeling the leather beneath. No, keep it like this: a secret leather-clad temptress in the grocery aisle. Cassie checked her watch and took one last look around the kitchen. Time to go shopping.

She picked up her handbag from the breakfast bar and began to speculate idly whether she should slip on the stilettos after all. Pushing a trolley in four-inch heels would be ridiculous, if not downright lethal, but she could already feel herself slickening at the thought of it. She would drive home and Damian would be back from the party; she'd ask him to help unload the shopping, bending over so that he would be able to see her legs wrapped in stockings and her fuck-me heels. She quivered at the thought.

Cassie heard the front door open. She checked her watch again: the birthday party wasn't due to finish for hours yet. A naughty thought crept into her head: Damian had already noticed her stockings and he'd dumped the boys with the other parents to come back and make passionate love to her. Cassie's excitement spiked.

""Hey babe,"" she called out, ""I'm in the kitchen.""

""Good. I was hoping to catch you before you headed out shopping.""

Cassie froze in shock. A woman's voice. Lily's voice.

She turned slowly to face the kitchen doorway, waiting with dread for her rival to appear. Lily swished through, flashing Cassie a wide smile as she put her handbag and keys down on the breakfast bar.

""Hi babe,"" she said.

Cassie watched silently as Lily opened a cupboard and pulled out a cup.

""Do you want one? I need one. Hell of a week.""

Lily walked over to the coffee machine and placed the cup under the spout. She popped a coffee capsule in the top and pressed the button. Cassie stared at the intruder, standing with her back turned to Cassie, calmly making herself a drink in Cassie's kitchen. Her stomach clenched.

Lily was dressed casually in a tight cotton t-shirt and hip-hugging jeans. Her long, straight blonde hair was tossed casually over a shoulder. Her red fingernails played on the controls of the coffee machine, selecting her preferences.

The machine spluttered and hissed, finally disgorging a trickle of steaming black liquid. Lily took the cup and turned, resting her bottom against the edge of the counter. She sipped.

""Ah, yes. Black. I needed this.""

Lily's green eyes danced around the kitchen, finally seeming to notice Cassie standing against the opposite wall.

""So, Cassie, tell me. How's your week been?""

Cassie swallowed, her mouth dry. Lily smiled sweetly, cradling her cup, as if they were two close friends catching up on the gossip.

""What are you doing here?"" she rasped.

""Oh, just thought I'd drop by since it's the weekend. Thought I'd say hi to your gorgeous husband.""

""He's not here. He took the boys to a birthday party.""

Lily shrugged. ""He'll be back soon. He said you were going to be out all morning, so he arranged to come back here.""

""What?""

""Yes, we talked about it. Your boys will be having the time of their lives at the adventure place and there are other parents to cover for an hour or two. Plenty of time for a catch up. Damian was very insistent, to be honest.""

It was the way that Lily slipped Damian's name into the conversation, the way she said it, that hit Cassie like a bullet. Her casual tone, the way she had just walked into the house, the way she'd discussed her intentions to have sex with Cassie's husband. The brilliant green eyes in that lovely face locked onto her, showing no regret, knowing that Cassie was powerless to stop her. Lily was enjoying it all immensely.

Lily took another mouthful of coffee and then set the cup down. She began to walk towards Cassie, her lips curved into a smirk, hips swaying. She came up close, standing slightly taller, looking down.

""I know you already had your own plans today,"" Lily said.

Her eyes took in Cassie's dress, eyebrows arching as her gaze fell to Cassie's ankles, clad in the fine black mesh.

""So, one option is for you to pick up the car keys and go do the groceries like a good little wife while I ride your husband's wonderful body for the next hour or two. You can maybe sit in the coffee shop, check out your friends' lives on the socials. I'll let you know when the coast is clear for you to return.""

Lily reached out and brushed Cassie's hair back from her face. The tender, intimate gesture sent shivers through Cassie's body. She looked up at her tormentor mutely.

""You can then carry on with your sexy little plan, if you like, when he gets home. Let's see how eager he is to bed his wife after he's been with me.""

Lily's hands reached out, stroking the sides of Cassie's body, discovering the secret outfit beneath the loose cotton. She smiled broadly.

""You're going all out, aren't you. Do you think it's enough, though? I mean, to get him up again? Once he's spent the morning inside me, do you think he's going to look twice at the older model, even in all her naughty attire?""

Lily's hands settled on Cassie's hips. Her palms pressed against the cotton, rubbing gently, moving the fabric over the leather skirt beneath.

""You're so sexy, in your little leather outfit, aren't you? Do you want to know what Damian really thinks? He told me. He told me everything.""

""Get away from me,"" Cassie hissed, finding her voice at last.

""Oh, babe,"" Lily chuckled, ""Seems I underestimated the fight in you after all.""

Cassie grasped Lily's wrists to pull her hands away from Cassie's thighs, but Lily held firm, digging her fingers and thumbs into Cassie's flesh.

""I think option two,"" Lily whispered, her face close enough now to kiss. ""Why don't we tour the scene of the crime?""

Lily's grip shifted, her fingers sliding into Cassie's hand. She gripped it and turned, leading Cassie out of her kitchen. Cassie felt herself being pulled along by the younger woman, strangely unable to break free of her grip. Lily led her to the stairs and they began to climb.

""Damian was impressed, by the way,"" Lily called over her shoulder. ""I mean, impressed enough to tell me. Not necessarily so impressed that he forgot who makes him feel better in bed. We discussed you at length, lying there in each other's arms afterwards. He tells me everything Cassie. We've become very close.""

Lily led her into the bedroom, towards the walk-in wardrobe. Cassie could see the excitement in the younger woman's beautiful face.

""So first, the ropes. That was a nice touch. Can I see?""

Cassie didn't move. Lily's smile hardened fractionally.

""Can I see,"" she repeated, ""Bitch?""

Cassie stood her ground, struggling valiantly with the dark feelings welling up from within her. Lily stepped close and Cassie felt her body react with a deep dread to the other woman's proximity. She gritted her teeth.

""This can be as hard or as easy as you want, bitch. Show me the ropes, or do you want me to get creative?""

Lily's smile faded and Cassie found herself looking deep into the implacable emerald green of Lily's eyes. Her heart was pounding. She needed to do something to stop this awful creature. She wanted to lash out, to rake her fingernails across those flawless cheeks, to make Lily scream in pain, but her body wasn't obeying her. Cassie was frozen to the spot, anguish bubbling up inside her.

Lily grasped Cassie's wrist, pulling her hand up and waving it around like she was a puppet.

""Just show me where you put them.""

Lily trailed Cassie hand over each handle of the drawers until Cassie grasped one.

""There, good girl. Not so hard after all.""

Cassie watched as Lily pulled the drawer open and began to hunt through the clothing. Finally, she found what she was looking for at the back.

""Aha, here we go,"" Lily said, pulling out the cotton rope and the black eye mask. Lily laughed, ""Yes, he told me about the blindfold, about your silly idea. I'm amazed you kept all this. Were you going to try again, maybe?""

Lily ran the rope through her fingers and continued, ""Second time's the charm, right, Cassie? If at first you don't succeed?""

Cassie felt Lily's hand in the small of her back, pulling at Cassie's dress.

""Up and off, let's go.""

Cassie tried to struggle, but Lily already had the dress up over her waist, exposing the stockings and tiny leather skirt. She pushed against the other woman, deadlocked, trying to stop herself being stripped.

Lily laughed. ""Oh, so this is the famous outfit. This is what you were counting on to bring him back to you, is it?""

Cassie flushed, shrinking inwards with embarrassment, her eyes dropping to the tangle of her dress in Lily's grip.

""You're sadder than I thought, but let's be specific here. I already thought you were very sad, but I dunno, dressing up like this. It's just so... desperate.""

Lily tugged again, and Cassie's resistance evaporated. The dress came up over her head easily, leaving Cassie fully exposed to her adversary. Lily began to unwind the rope.",,2025-08-15T19:20:56.548831,3492,

by SubKaren92

As I drove away from our house, my thoughts were on my husband (and Master) and what he was going to do with (to) Liz. But the further I got from the house and subsequently the closer I got to Jerome and Naomi's house, my thoughts shifted focus on what they would do to me. I assumed Jerome was going to fuck my ass. And while I could handle the large plug, I wasn't 100% sure I could handle him. Still my anticipation and arousal was sky high by the time I parked in front of their house. There was another car in their driveway I didn't recognize from the last time I was here. I took a deep breath, exited my car and walked up to the front door. There was a note taped to the door. It was in elegant handwriting so I assumed Naomi had written it. It was simple and to the point.

""Welcome back, slut. Go to the side door of the garage. It will be unlocked. Strip down to your naked ass. Put on the collar you will find and crawl to us in the living room.""

I wondered what color the collar would be. I'd promised Robert to wear a red, no holes barred collar. Did that message reach Jerome and Naomi? I quickly walked around the garage to the side of their house and found the door. The interior garage light turned on automatically. I shut the door and looked around. It was just a typical garage. I saw a black leather collar with a chain leash sitting on the hood of the car nearest the house. I took another deep breath and stripped off my dress. I left the plug in. I figured that didn't count against being naked. I then buckled the collar around my neck. A wave of submissive feelings flowed over my body. It was a simple act, but the symbolism was powerful. I opened the door and took two steps inside while closing the door. I then dropped to my knees. I could hear people talking in the living room. I couldn't be sure, but the man's voice didn't sound like Jerome. Not wanting to keep them waiting as they probably knew I was there the moment the side door opened, I began crawling toward the living room. When I got there, I saw two couples sitting at the dining room table. They looked like they were playing cards, of all things. Jerome was the first to speak.

""Ah, Beth. So nice of you to return and be our toy tonight.""

That wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I was 100% good with it. I thought maybe they expected me to act as their maid until the second couple left and Naomi and Jerome had their way with me. But as I got closer, I saw that Naomi was dressed in a sheer robe that tied around her waist. Her breasts were clearly visible through it and her legs were available through the center slit. The other woman, who was strikingly beautiful, was also in lingerie and her man (husband?) was nearly as muscular as Jerome. Both of them were just wearing boxer shorts. If I had to guess, all four of them were dressed for easy access to have a naked slut serve them. But it was still weird that they were playing cards. Maybe they were playing strip poker.

""Does anybody need a refresh of their drink before we resume?"" Naomi said.

The woman stood up and in a sultry voice indicated she could use a bathroom break but the two men were good. Part of me wanted Naomi to order me to follow her friend to the bathroom to either wipe or lick her pussy, but instead I was told to climb up and lay on the table. That was another thing I wasn't expecting. Naomi, Jerome and the man continued their conversation as if I wasn't there. But when the woman returned and sat opposite of her partner, they both started teasing my nipples. Jerome was sitting on the side where my head was and my fantasy mind expected him to whip is cock out and fuck my mouth. That left Naomi on my pussy side watching intently as my juices started leaking out of me thanks to the nipple play. I started to wonder if I was about to be tied to the table and ravaged. Instead, they started playing cards again.

I later learned Euchre was the game. The couples were playing as teams and there was no sexual component, at least beyond having to reach across a naked slut to play their cards. I thought maybe they were playing for who would partner up with each other or who would be in charge, but as you probably guessed, all four of them would be in charge of me.

After about 15 minutes of my displaying my charms to them. Naomi stood up and walked into the kitchen. Conversation stopped as I think they knew what was going to happen. When she returned, she held a curved toy that looked like a thick egg shaped vibrator. She pressed a button and it sprang to life. It sounded powerful. I licked my lips in anticipation. She then pressed a few buttons on her phone. I wondered if she just took a picture of my wet pussy. After a few more taps on her phone, she told the group we were ready. She then licked the vibe and pushed it into my pussy. It was wide enough to fill me and there was a top piece that curved up toward my clit. Only my husband had witnessed what happens to me when a vibe hits my clit bar. I had a feeling everyone was about to experience that. Soon after the vibe was buried deep inside my needy snatch, it turned on, but very slowly. My hips jumped a bit at the surprise. It was the first time I had something in both my holes and the vibration from the vibe transferred to the plug in my ass. Even though it was on a slow setting, it felt amazing.

""Who did you send the link to?"" the woman asked. Naomi answered, ""Who knows? It was an anonymous post asking for volunteers.""

I did not understand what she was saying. But as the speed of the vibe grew stronger, understanding it was not a high priority. Cumming too quickly without permission would be a much bigger issue. At least I thought it would be until Jerome leaned over me and told me I had permission to cum for the entire evening. That sounded like a gift and I moaned. But then it slowed down again. I tried to look around to see if anybody was controlling the vibe, but it seemed like everyone was prepared to go back to playing cards.

Whomever was controlling the vibrator had an annoying habit of speeding it up, but only for a few seconds before slowing it down. He (I assume it was a he) would then change the speed up and down within a narrow band. That kept me wanting more, but without really enough stimulation to cum. The second couple would occasionally tease my nipples between hands, but not if they could hear the vibrator when it was occasionally on high. As was usually the case, I was being driven crazy with lust and my vocalizations were disturbing the game. If they just made me cum, I would have been quieter. Then the doorbell rang. Surprisingly I wasn't sent to answer it. I was surprised they didn't want me to expose myself. Instead Naomi went to the door. Her sheer robe wasn't much better than being naked, but at least it wasn't me.

I could hear that the person at the door was delivering food. They definitely got an eyeful. I heard Naomi walking back toward the group. But she wasn't alone. There was a young Asian man with her. Apparently they had ordered Chinese food. Naomi ""apologized"" that they didn't have any cash for a tip, but if he wanted a blow job instead, their toy would be happy to take care of him. It sounded like a plot for a porno and I'm sure they had some cash, but I was equally sure they just wanted to push me to see if I would do it. The guy seemed very skeptical, which was justified, but when Jerome helped me up and then off the table, I knew the offer was real even if he didn't.

""Take him to the guest bedroom,"" Jerome told (ordered) me. ""We'll keep playing.""

""Follow me,"" I said before starting to walk toward the hallway.

""Why are you walking slut?"" Naomi hissed. I realized my mistake immediately and dropped to my knees. I wondered if I'd earned a punishment. I started to crawl toward the bedroom and I wondered if the vibe would fall out. I tried to clamp my kegel muscles down on it, but before I got to the guest bedroom, the vibe turned on full speed and I had to stop crawling. It was more powerful than I assumed when at full speed and I basically fell to the floor in a fetal position as a powerful orgasm ripped through me. If I had any shame, I probably would have wondered what the delivery driver thought about it, but I didn't. The endorphin rush was wonderful, although it delayed the driver getting his tip for a couple of minutes. As it turned out, that wasn't the only challenge I had.

Finally in the safety of the guest bedroom and the vibe back down to a slow roar, I got on my knees and reached for his belt. He stepped back away from me.

""What's wrong?"" I asked him. ""I don't mind doing this. Actually I want to do this. How old are you?""

Clearly he was nervous because of his age. He answered 19.

""Are you a virgin?"" I asked, figuring that he might be nervous about pulling out his cock.

""No, it's not that,"" he replied. ""I have a girlfriend but she doesn't do this. Also I don't want to cheat on her.""

""You don't have to fuck me unless you want to,"" I told him hoping he would take the hint and do exactly that. ""And she doesn't have to know I blew you.""

He was still a bit reluctant so I told him to lay down on the bed. I could see he was struggling whether to do that, but eventually he did. I didn't reach for his pants right away. Instead I leaned over him and pushed my left nipple to his lips. ""Does she do this?"" I asked him. Could any man really resist sucking a hard nipple when offered? He certainly could not. I let him suckle me for about a minute to make sure he was fully engaged in what was going on. Then I reached down to his crotch. I wasn't surprised that his cock was somewhat hard in his pants. I put my left hand behind his head to keep him latched onto my nipple and used my right hand to unbuckle his belt, unbutton his pants and then unzip them. Reaching into his pants, I grabbed his cock through his underwear and began rhythmically squeezing it to get him to full hardness.

Once he was hard, I knew his concerns about his girlfriends would melt away and they did. I also knew his friends would not believe the story of him getting a blow job for a tip. When I finally pulled down his underwear enough to fish out his cock, I told him he could take a picture if he wanted. But he declined. That was probably the smartest thing he did tonight.

Since his girlfriend didn't want to suck his cock (I never found out if this was his first blowjob) I figured he wouldn't last long. And he didn't. He did give me a nice sized load and he had a nice flavor. It was different than I was used to, but he probably ate a different diet than my usual partners too. After he shot, he quickly got up and pulled his pants back up without giving me a chance to lick him clean. Hopefully tonight wouldn't be the night his girlfriend decided to give him something special before I got a chance to shower. He walked out of the room and I crawled behind him. I was expecting to be ordered back onto the table. The vibe was still buzzing, although the quick and brief high speed blasts were less frequent. Still, I could easily cum again if it stayed up for a couple minutes. Whoever was controlling it obviously thought teasing me was better, although since I'd already cum once, it didn't drive me as crazy as it otherwise would have.

The card game was apparently over and the party had moved to the living room. The table in front of the couch had been moved out of the way. An anti-fatigue mat had been placed on the floor. I theorized I might be on my knees a lot tonight. Naomi and the mystery woman had shed their lingerie and were sitting on the couch. Jerome and the mystery man had shed their boxers. The mystery man was almost as well endowed as Jerome. I licked my lip again. They were both holding video cameras on monopods. I wanted to just crawl up to guy two and start sucking him off. But I knew I was supposed to start with Naomi so I crawled between her legs.

The other woman commented, ""She's very well trained.""

Naomi said, ""We really have not worked with her much. She's a natural. Her husband has been doing her training the last few weeks.""

I don't know why having them speak about me and not to me warmed my heart so much. Something about being objectified turned me on as I dove into Naomi's pussy. I knew three other people were watching me and that inspired me to do my best to get her off quickly. Just like our last encounter, Naomi's pussy was very wet from the start and again she grabbed my head to hold me tightly against her folds as I worked my tongue on her clit and eventually two fingers into her pussy.

I could tell by the sounds that the other woman was masturbating as she sat next to us watching, but I dared not lift my head to look at her. I assumed I would taste her in turn. I also assumed I wouldn't get fucked until I got both women off, so if she wanted to help by playing with herself, I was all for it. Naomi obviously wanted me to do all the work for her. That was fine too. I loved her taste and I loved the way her hips rocked against my head as her arousal built. I tried to curl my fingers to stimulate her g-spot as I loved the way she squirted on me last time. But clearly I need to work on that move and ask for instruction because I didn't seem to find it. But even a regular orgasm by Naomi was greeted with cheers from the audience and I was pleased with myself for making her cum.

Naomi let go of my head and I scooted over so I was in front of the other woman. It felt strange not having been introduced to her. When I first fucked Jerome that was part of the kink. But since I'd been with this other couple for over an hour, it seemed weird not to know their names. Not that it mattered. I gladly began to service her as well. I even wiggled my ass in an attempt to entice Jerome and his friend to either spank me or finger me. But they would do nothing, other than record the action, until the mystery woman finally climaxed. She patted my head in thanks as if I was a dog. I didn't particularly care for that. I was more focused on what would come next as I was sure it was my time now.

Had Jerome and his friend stood on either side of me feeding me their cocks, I wouldn't have been surprised. I fully expected Jerome to fuck my ass so if the two of them spit roasted me, that was anticipated as well. What I didn't expect was the two women to leave the room, Jerome to order me to stand in front of the camera and rub my pussy. He made me confess I was a submissive slut and their toy much like my Master and done. The women came back a few minutes later, both wearing strap-ons. I'm not sure why I didn't expect that as Naomi had told me before she wanted to fuck me. But there we were.

Naomi was acting as the video director as she told me to get back on my knees facing out into the living room. She then positioned the boys to get the camera angle she wanted. I then had to give a double blow job to the strap-ons. I knew this was just for the benefit of the camera as I was wet enough for them to fuck me already. Both strap-ons were large and black, no surprise, but thankfully they were not as large as Jerome and his buddy. After Naomi was satisfied she had enough footage for however she planned to edit the video, I was ordered to my hands and knees. The new woman stood by my head and Naomi moved behind me.

""You know what to do slut,"" Naomi said as she slapped my ass. I had a pretty good guess what she meant. I rocked back until I felt her cock teasing my labia. ""Fuck me, Mama!"" I shouted. She put one hand on the small of my back to help guide the strap-on into my pussy. As soon as that happened, I opened my mouth and started sucking on the other woman's cock. My first spit-roast was off and running.

While Naomi's strap-on wasn't the biggest thing I'd ever had in my pussy, that honor went to her husband, it was the biggest I'd had when plugged. The plug pressed the thin membrane between my vagina and ass together tightening up both. Naomi took it easy on me at first, perhaps for the benefit of the camera. She eventually started to fuck me harder, but never really built up a powerful cadence. It was as if she was making me wait for my real pleasure. Then she asked Jerome to grab the lube. I would have smiled if my mouth wasn't full of fake cock. When he returned, Naomi slapped my ass and pulled out. I was then told to stand again.

""Face the camera and tell the world you want your ass fucked by four superior blacks,"" Naomi said. ""Then you can pull out the plug and hold it up to the camera as well,"" she added.

This was both humiliating and exciting. After my confession, they had me turn my ass to the camera and pull my butt cheeks apart. I could tell my asshole did not snap back to normal after having the large plug in me for so long. I was happy about that, although I would later learn when I watched the video, a gaping asshole does not look ladylike.

I expected to be told to kneel on the couch so they could take turns fucking my backdoor. That wasn't Naomi's plan. At least not yet. She took the bottle of lube and greased up her cock. She then sat down on the couch and pointed to it. ""Mount up in a reverse cowgirl,"" she instructed. The two cameras, one I assume setup for a wide shot and one zoomed in to see the dildo going up my brown hole captured the action. As I sat back on her cock, although I'd prepared and trained for this moment with Robert, it still felt huge. But it went in with little struggle. The other woman then moved in front of me and aimed her strap-on at my pussy.

Naomi didn't do much. She pretty much sat there while her friend fucked the hell out of me. Each time she thrusted and her pelvis pressed against mine, two things happened. The bar in my clit got stimulated and my ass got forced down on Naomi's cock. Then when the woman pulled out, my ass slid up Naomi's cock ready to be slammed down again. Oh, and did I mention, the sensation of having my pussy and ass pressed together that felt so good with the plug felt even better with the two fake cocks? I could only imagine what it would feel like with two real cocks.

I was kind of surprised Jerome and his friend let Naomi direct the action for so long. They had to want their turn. Or turns. But the women apparently were determined to force a screaming orgasm from me. And they did. It hit with a vengeance. I didn't even feel it building. The pleasure the women were giving me was so intense that I basically was taking the fucking they were giving me and then all of a sudden my body released without warning. It was as if my body knew what I was doing was wrong so it was trying to protect my brain from enjoying it but it could only hold out so long and as soon as my body told my mind it was OK, I exploded. The other woman held her cock in me as my body convulsed through my climax. I was kind of glad she didn't keep fucking me. She then pulled out and Naomi told me to stand up. I was smiling ear to ear as I assumed it was Jerome's turn. Alas, it was not.

Now I found myself on my knees facing the back of the couch. I had expect this position earlier, but instead of Jerome or his friend, Naomi was fucking my ass again. That was OK as nobody told me I couldn't rub my pussy with one hand while I braced myself against the back of the couch with the other. She was going to town as well. While I'd been sitting on her, she couldn't really fuck me. Her cock was mainly just to tighten up my pussy for the other woman. Without that restriction, she seemed intent on destroying my back door. My mind was spinning. The other woman walked behind the couch and fed me her cock to clean. I'd learned to appreciate the flavor of my own pussy so this was fine. It also kept my moans and screams to a minimum. Without the dildo gag, the neighbors likely would have heard me.",,2025-08-15T19:21:01.566659,3866,

With that said, there have been a few people who feel that they can bash a story without giving constructive criticism. I have and will continue to delete such comments. I completely understand that the story of Anna, Chrissi, Maggie, and Jill is not for everyone. People have different tastes and I am happy that is a fact. It would be a boring and dull world if everyone enjoyed the exact same things, whether it is movies, music, food, or yes even erotic or smut-filled stories that I tend to write.

This story includes lesbian sex including mother and daughter relations, humiliation, punishments, and more. I would also like to note that it is completely unrealistic and purely fiction. If you aren't into those kinds of things, once again that is cool. This site has many other stories that will be sure to get you in that horny state that we are all chasing while browsing Literotica.

If you are still here, part 5 picks up directly where part 4 ended. If this is the first time you are reading an Anna Takes Control story, I do suggest reading the first part as this part might not make too much sense without reading what came before.

Finally, I hope to read your thoughts, good or constructive in the comment section!

Jill stood in Anna's room, Chrissi behind her. Anna sat on her bed, ""Jill, I have spoken with Chrissi, and she has given her blessing. Mommy slut, please leave and return with Maggie in 10 minutes. I believe Jill and I have some things we need to talk about.""

""Yes, Miss Anna,"" Chrissi smiled as she left the room closing the door.

Anna patted the mattress next to her as Jill sat close to her, ""How are you holding up? I know this, everything is a lot to take in.""

Jill brushed her shoulder-length dark hair behind her ear, highlighting a grey streak that had been there long before Maggie introduced Anna to her mom. Her breasts remained lewdly displayed, pulled over the low neckline of her striped tank top.

""This is a lot. I never once thought of the day that my daughter would make me cum as I watched my friend eat her daughter's asshole,"" Jill let out a nervous laugh, ""I think I am handling it pretty well. What about you? How are you holding up?"" Jill's memory flashed to the confident woman next to her, poring tears on her shoulder earlier in the day.

""I am good. I mean, I am hurt but I am making do. When life gives you lemons, you make sluts, right?"" Anna giggled at her own joke as Jill joined in.

""I suppose that is one way to look at it.""

""Before those mentioned sluts interrupted us, Chrissi said it was okay if we took things further. However, I am not one for one-time flings. If we do take the next step and this is completely up to you, I am looking for more. I would like to have an equal. It is okay if that is not what you are looking for. Chrissi is also aware of how I feel. The cards are on the table and it is your call. Did I already say today was a lot to take in?"" Anna gently laid her hand on top of Jill's.

""Are you asking me to be your girlfriend, Anna? I don't want to sound too stupid but I want to make sure I understand what you are asking.""

""I am. I know it is probably unhinged crazy to ask my ex-girlfriend's mother this but I couldn't imagine anyone else that would be accepting of my life. Chrissi would still be my mommy-wife, but that can only go so far. I mean, she is not exactly my equal. Then there is Maggie, she could never be my girlfriend again.""

""I understand where you are coming from. My heart was shattered when I caught my ex-husband in bed with that tramp. I haven't dated anyone seriously since then. I have shared a bed or backseat of a car with a few lucky guys and girls but never dated anyone. I believe I don't have to worry about you cheating on me, outside of the sluts. This won't just turn into a sex thing, right? That is, if I say yes,"" Jill sat down for a moment, ""If I do say yes, it has to be more than sex.""

""I want, no I need more than sex. I need a relationship built on trust and love,"" Anna confessed to the older woman next to her, ""You have been like a mother to me through the years and that is because I have grown to trust you. I want to be given the chance to fall in love with you, Jill.""

Jill could only smile as Anna said this to her. ""I don't want to be the third wheel to you and Chrissi as you consider her your wife,"" Jill's voice was thoughtful but honest, ""I wouldn't want to interfere in that. It is intimidating, I am not going to lie. Still, I believe my girlfriend can make it work. Please don't break my heart. I promise, here and now, to not break yours.""

Anna's face lit up when she heard Jill call her 'her girlfriend'. When she called Jill over, it was purely for needing someone to talk to and to get Maggie's finances taken care of. Before this afternoon she never once thought of Jill as of a sexual nature. She witnessed Maggie lick her mother to orgasm. The same mother that is now on Anna's bed and having a life-changing conversation with. She meant every word that she said and deep down, she knew Jill matched her honesty.

""Is that a yes?"" Anna questioned as her heart filled with butterflies.

""Yes, you wonderful girl,"" Jill replied with her newfound confidence. Before today she never knew that side of herself.

""I want to kiss you and make love to you but I think there is some poetic justice to be served. Our sluts should watch the first time we explore each other's bodies as it was their actions that pushed us into each other's arms,"" Anna declared.

Jill smiled and couldn't get over how Anna was always a step ahead of her. That wouldn't last for long as she was now Anna's co-conspirator. She was Anna's girlfriend.

""Is it silly to feel like a schoolgirl? A 44-year-old woman to have these feelings is certainly weird,"" Jill's inner voice was singing.

The two women sat on the bed, both in a haze of excitement that only a new relationship can bring. The future was certainly brighter than it was this morning. They sat silently waiting for the sluts to enter. The smiles on their faces were the only thing Chrissi needed to see as she opened the door.

Maggie followed on all fours, her makeup perfect as the weights on her small tits swung with each movement forward. Chrissi did not say a word about why they were needed. At this point in Maggie's sexually frustrated head, it didn't matter. She was growing used to obeying. Maggie didn't like what her life was quickly becoming but she was slowly accepting it. There was still a tinge of stubbornness but it was clouded by her need to cum.

""Maggie, take off your mother's shirt, and then you may return to all fours,"" Anna ordered.

Watching Maggie, the younger and smaller chested version of Jill, do as she was told. The striped tank top was now in Maggie's hands.

""Mommy slut and slut, we have something to tell you,"" Anna began and then Jill took over, ""due to your infidelity, we have found each other. You will watch as I make love to my girlfriend. Oh, and Maggie, you are allowed to hump the corner of the dresser and can cum only after both of us cum.""

""Yes, Miss Jill,"" Maggie felt a wave of relief but embarrassed that her mother was the person that gave her permission to cum.

Anna was surprised by this but smiled, ""Mommy slut you will clean her cum with your hair, and then you may cum.""

""Yes, Miss Anna,"" Chrissi quickly replied in her new bubbly tone of voice. Jill thought of how she would have to get used to hearing her old friend speak like that.

""Before I kiss your mother for the first time, Maggie. I want you to know that Jill is something that you will never be to me, my girlfriend and lover. You are to not hold any ill will to her. As of this moment, Jill will be your owner as much as I am. That goes for you too, Chrissi. You may be my mommy-wife, but Jill is my girlfriend.""

Maggie nodded her head as she already began to slide her wet cunt against the dresser's corner.

Chrissi smiled, ""I understand Miss Anna and Miss Jill. I am happy for you both!"" Her hand was squeezing her big tit.

Anna looked into Jill's eyes as Jill was doing the same. Biting her lip, Jill slowly moved forward knowing her life would never be the same again. Knowing she would not be alone. Anna's lips gently bumped into Jill's. The soon-to-be lovers' mouths simultaneously opened slowly as if this was a well-rehearsed kiss for a play. The moment Jill felt Anna's tongue in her mouth, she let out the first of many sighs into her girlfriend's mouth. The kiss grew in passion as Jill wrapped her arms around Anna's back, pulling her closer. Anna's hand found itself in Jill's hair as her tongue began the first trek of exploration of her sexy new lover's body.

Maggie watched as Anna and Jill made out, her cunt sliding against the dresser. She remorsefully missed Anna's passionate kisses that were now relegated to Jill, her mother, and Chrissi, Anna's mother. A brisk reminder of her sin.

Jill and Anna's kiss broke as they smiled at each other. Jill felt Anna's firm breasts for the first time, cupping her lover's round curves as she brushed her thumbs over the red-haired woman's nipples. Leaning in to kiss her lover's neck, her mouth found itself behind Anna's ear as she slowly traveled to her shoulder. The two women's eyes met as Anna bit her lip, her hand circling her lover's soft skin.

Chrissi watched as Anna let out a light moan born from Jill's soft kisses. The blonde bimbo was caressing her cunt slowly, totally enthralled with the scene before her. She had made love to her daughter but something about this was more sensual. Anna wasn't dominating with Jill. She saw as two women slowly became one. The sound of Maggie spanking her cunt took her out of the moment and she giggled at her adulterous lover.

If Anna or Jill heard Maggie spanking her cunt or the soft cries that came out of her mouth they didn't let it be known as Jill began to kiss Anna's collar bone, slowly moving south. Her loving lips were exploring her fire-haired lover's body as if she was the first person on an expedition to a new land. Moving from Anna's collarbone Jill began to kiss the crease between her round breasts, her head deep in Anna's cleavage as she glided her mouth, forming small suctions on Anna's breasts. As she did this she was carefully avoiding Anna's pierced and pink mountaintops. When she did finally make contact with Anna's hard nipple, Jill licked around the younger woman's areola before sucking on her pierced prize. Her mouth's suction could only be compared to an industrial suction cup. She wasn't letting go as her teeth lightly nibbled and her tongue quickly flicked above the piercing. Anna was moaning as she held her lover close to her, her fingers danced over Jill's soft skin. When Jill finally let go, she looked up and Anna leaned forward kissing the older woman.

Maggie was on all fours watching her mother and ex-girlfriend in front of her. She felt a ping of jealousy but knew this was happening because of her and Chrissi. She could only moan as her cunt ground into the hard surface of the dresser. The weights hanging from her tits were more noticeable as she fucked the furniture faster, knowing her beloved and much-needed orgasm was closer than it had been in days.

Breaking the kiss, Jill smiled as she slid a leg under Anna's leg and then wrapped it around Anna's body, moving closer to Anna as her free leg rested on top of Anna's thigh. Anna held Jill close as she felt Jill's nipples pressed against her own. With a moan, Anna felt her wet pussy make contact with Jill's equally wet pussy. Letting out a sigh as Jill began to thrust her hips against Anna's pussy. Anna followed Jill's lead and began to grind against her lover. Feeling her juices mix with her sapphic lover, her girlfriend. The two women began to moan as they moved faster at the same tempo, briefly kissing or groping each other whenever the chance presented itself.

Jill was the first to show signs of her pending orgasm as she arched her back, her heavy breasts bounced and heaved forward on her chest. Her hands were flat on the bed, using her arms to hold up her body. Her hips moved faster as her increasingly wet pussy was kissing Anna's equally wet pussy. Anna was watching her beautiful lover as she let out a loud moan, ""Fuck me, Jill! Fuck my pussy!""

In the throughs of passion Anna's hands found themselves squeezing her sensitive breasts, her breaths shortened and heavy with each thrust into her lover's pussy. Moving her hand away from the mounds on her chest to the top of Jill's pussy, her thumb found the pearl peeking from its hiding place. As she was rubbing her lover's clit, her hand would bump into her sensitive nub making her moan.

Jill's voice grew louder as her breasts bounced with each thrust. Feeling her lover's thumb on her clit was a welcome surprise as she let out a primal scream of pleasure. Maggie watched as her mother and ex-girlfriend fucked each other on the bed. If her place in life wasn't cemented as the house slut, hearing the screams definitely helped. Her cunt was beyond needy as she eagerly pushed it against the dresser behind her.

Chrissi had two fingers in her cunt, mesmerized as she watched her daughter-wife make love to another woman. She was turned on by being made to watch Anna and Jill bond in such a sapphic way. Every now and then she would rub her freshly pierced clit which reminded her that she was Anna's and now Jill's bimbo to use as they pleased. She was in bliss that she couldn't describe.

Grunting, ""FUCK, THAT FEELS SOOO GOOD!!!"" Jill screamed as Anna continued to rub her clit. She was moments away from cumming and she knew it. ""SLUT WATCH AS ANNA... MAKES ME... FUCK!!!... CUM!!!!!!""

Maggie watched as Anna made Jill cum all over her pussy. For Maggie, this meant her orgasm was moments closer.

Loud screams with passion filled the room. Jill gave into her inner need as her orgasm took over her body and thoughts. Her toes curled as her lover held her tight and continued to grind her pussy. Her juices covered her lover's pussy and inner thighs. It didn't take long for Anna to find her sexual bliss. Thoughts filled her head like love and compatibility but were soon flooded with lust and cumming.

""JILL... FUCK!!!! I'M CUMMINGGG!!!"" Anna's voice trailed off into a loud moaning scream that matched Jill's scream moments earlier. The storm crashed through her body as her body gave in to her needs. She slowly came to a stop grinding against her lover's pussy and came back to reality when she heard her girlfriend's voice.

""Cum you dumb slut. Cum on that dresser, you needy bitch."" Jill's voice was commanding and domineering as she spoke to Maggie, her daughter.

Anna was able to turn her head just in time to see her ex-girlfriend moan and give a familiar face as she exploded on the dresser. Maggie knew everyone in the room had their eyes on her as she shamefully came on a piece of furniture. She didn't care as she experienced the best orgasm of her life, her eyes closed, the words that oozed out of her mouth were incomprehensible as she slammed her cunt into the corner of the dresser.

""Mommy slut, you may push that nasty slut out of the way so you clean my dresser with your hair. I don't want her pathetic cunt juices to stain the wood,"" Anna ordered her mother as she held Jill's hand tightly.

Jill's fingers were interlaced with Anna's and before the blonde bimbo could reply, ""Slut apologize to Chrissi for making such a nasty mess on your Mistress dresser as she has to clean it.""

Chrissi did have to push the orgasm riddled Maggie out of the way as she held her hair attempting to wipe off the dresser.

Maggie landing back on reality whispered thank you for cleaning my cum, Chrissi."" Her mind was still foggy from the orgasm that she had because her mother gave her permission.

Anna whispered something into Jill's ear and the two women on the bed giggled as they looked at Maggie.

""Come here you pathetic slut, show us your used cunt. I want to see your legs spread so we have a good view."" Jill ordered her daughter.

Maggie began to crawl towards the bed that the two lovers sat on.

Chrissi's hair was soaked with Maggie's cum as she continued to scrub the mess the best she could. Her pussy was ready to explode but she wasn't permitted to cum by either of her owners. Plural, she will have to get used to that she thought.

In front of Anna, her ex, and Jill, her mother, Maggie turned so she was looking at the closet door. She slowly spread her legs so her cunt was on full display, poking her ass in the air, her head rested on her arms. Her legs couldn't move any further from each other. Then she felt a hard slap on her cunt as she cried out a pain-laced whimper.

""You didn't thank my girlfriend for allowing you to cum.""

""Thank you, Miss Jill, for letting me cum,"" Maggie's voice was defeated as she thanked her mother for the chance to cum.

""I will accept your thanks, Maggie, but I feel it wasn't heartfelt as my girlfriend had to remind you. I gave you the gift of your needed orgasm and once again you have disrespected me. First by cheating on Anna, knowing how I feel about such behavior, and now this.""

Jill's hand spanked her daughter's used cunt after seeing Anna nod. Maggie cried as she apologized to her mother. Jill's hand didn't leave the wet cunt, instead, she cupped it and slid a finger into it.

Removing her finger and lifting her hand to her face, ""It appears my dumb daughter is still wet, even after two spankings on her cunt,"" licking her finger, ""You will watch Chrissi cum and then find some clothes that are suitable for a slut like you. We are going out so my girlfriend can spend some quality time with her mommy-wife.""

Anna looked at Chrissi, ""Mommy bimbo, you may stop cleaning Maggie's mess and come here. You will hump my leg and then when I tell you to, you will do the same to Jill's leg. I expect you to cum when Jill tells you to.""

""Yes, Miss Anna. Thank you both for letting me use your legs to cum,"" Chrissi scurried to her daughter's leg well aware of the way her tits bounced as she moved. The two women on the bed moved their legs so their feet were touching the ground as Chrissi lowered herself in an awkward position to proudly hump her daughter's leg.

""See how Chrissi's tits bounce as she fucks her daughter's leg, Maggie. That is what a real bimbo is supposed to look like. Not your measly little tits. It's a good thing you have a nice ass or you would be completely useless.""

Jill's words were like daggers in Maggie's ears. It was one thing for Anna to say something like that to her, she was slowly getting used to it. She didn't like it and she wasn't exactly accepting it but she was getting used to it. Now to hear her mother mock her small tits was a new low. The woman who would preach body positivity was now verbally lashing her because of her body, something she couldn't control. The idea of going under the knife to inflate her tits sickened her. Up until recently, she thought Anna felt the same but the encouragement of watching fake tittied porn stars made her question that.

Chrissi was moaning as she fucked her daughter's leg. She needed to cum but didn't dare to ask.

""You may switch to my lover's leg, mommy-slut."" Anna's voice purred with lust.

Chrissi quickly complied as she braved into the first sexual contact that she would have with her old friend and her daughter's girlfriend. Her wet cunt easily slid up and down as she moved her slit on Jill's leg.

""Does Chrissi the bimbo want to cum?"" Jill's voice was sympathetic towards Chrissi. Yes, she was the other half of the adulterous affair that her daughter was a part of but she didn't raise Chrissi. Chrissi didn't hold her night after night as she cried. No, that was Maggie.",,2025-08-15T19:21:05.453848,3659,

Chapter 19

*****

By some miracle, we do manage to get through the rest of dinner without anymore noteworthy insanity. It's actually rather pleasant, save for Piper keeps giving me subtle little glances, and Lucy regularly gives him less subtle glances that, I admit, make me fear for the boy's safety a tiny bit. And I suppose I can be caught sneaking glances at Master and Mistr- er, Miss Clara. If they notice me, they don't say anything. It is, after all, my duty to make sure things go smoothly. And all signs suggest they are.

After dinner, Miss Clara suggests that we all watch a movie together on the couch. To this, I argue, that the couch isn't large enough to accommodate all of us comfortably, which is somewhat true, and that we might be more comfortable watching the TV in the master bedroom. Lucy visibly rolls her eyes at me. I admit that it's a little bit transparent, but no one objects.

I, of course, get popcorn duty. Not that anyone says that specifically, but I'm the elf of the house, so naturally I would. I do my best to delay everyone from getting ready until I get upstairs; things assigning little tasks to Lucy and Piper, making sure that extra blankets go upstairs with me, and not before. I can't let them get too comfortable before I arrive, or I may lose my chance to grab a spot beside the couple. I can't trust the others to make sure things go right.

When we do get upstairs, I have to hurry to make sure I get my spot, as I can already see the others coveting it. Lucy lacks elven grace, she was easy to get ahead of, but I only narrowly slip by Piper to take the lead. I was in such a hurry, that I don't even realize that I'm beside Miss Clara, not Master. Not that I mind, I've wanted to be in closer to her since Master met her, but I fear that snuggling up against her may seem too aggressive.

To my delight, though, she actively reaches out and pulls me in close to her. Under a blanket. With her and Master. It is so very comfy.

I do feel a little bad for Piper. He's been quiet so far, but I can see how much he loves his mistress. He seems a decent enough elf, really. Of course, I don't feel bad enough to actually move, but you see what I'm saying. He shows clear apprehension about getting close to master, and with no real room on the other side of me, he finally elects to lay down towards the foot of the be. Somewhat surprisingly, Lucy lays beside him, not with us at the top. Not so much surprising that she did, as much as the fact that she did it in a rather non-creepy sort of way, leaving him relatively unmolested, and all of the holes in his body empty.

He'll have to make due. Sorry if Lucy does anything untoward that's going to hurt tomorrow, Piper, but you'll have to take one for the team.

The movie isn't great, but it holds our attention, and gives us things to snark at. Miss Clara is actually quite clever, she and Master make each other, and the rest of us, laugh quite a bit. And then, about an hour in, it happens. A sex scene.

Not just any sex scene, either. A human man and an elf girl. He throws her down and takes her roughly, making her squeal and moan. You don't really see anything below the waist, but that just makes my imagination fill it out. And, though maybe it's wishful thinking, but I swear I can smell Miss Clara getting aroused. Elvish noses are sharper than humans, but it's not as though we're bloodhounds or anything, and there's already the scent of myself and Lucy in the air - but still, I pick up something from her. The fact that her arm pulls me a little tighter and her fingers press into my skin seems to suggest I'm right.

Save for the movie, the room is completely quiet. Lucy decides to break the silence, ""She's faking.""

I thought it was pretty good performance.

""Lucy, it's a regular movie, of course she's faking. They aren't really having sex,"" Master reminds her of the obvious.

""I know. That's what I meant. Doesn't make it any less lame,"" Lucy complains.

""You expect them to start having real sex on set?"" Master chuckles a little.

Lucy turns back and raises up her hands like she thinks that should be obvious, ""This is what's wrong with Hollywood. No dedication to their craft. If they'd actually fuck, they'd get things right. Elves don't even sound like that when they cum.""

""I'll have to take your word on that, but Hollywood has bigger problems. I don't think it's fair to say that, of all things, is what's wrong with them. Real sex scenes wouldn't make them not be creatively bankrupt,"" Master tells her. He's technically right, but at the moment, I'm a little with Lucy on this one. Though that's probably just because I'd like to see the elf on screen getting actually penetrated.

The movie pauses, the remote in Miss Clara's hand, ""Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Back up!"" she declares, ""What do you mean you have to take her word on it?""

""Hm? I meant what she said about elven orgasms, I haven't seen one in person,"" Master tells Clara.

""Are you serious?"" Clara asks him, tilting her head.

He quirks an eyebrow, ""This shouldn't be news. I've told that I've never-""

""Never had proper sex with her, you didn't tell me you'd never let her cum. Not even once?"" Miss Clara sits up a bit and pulls me closer, practically into her lap, ""How long have you owned her?""

Master's eyes roll up a bit and he starts silently counting on his fingers.

Lucy raises her hand like she's in school, ""He hasn't let me cum properly, either.""

""Hush right now, dear, we're talking,"" Clara waves a hand at her, turning back to Master, ""Too long, apparently! At least a year?""

Master nods in agreement.

""Baby, you can't just leave her like that for so long after you take ownership,"" she shakes her head. I'm starting to really like Miss Clara.

""I don't want to go around indulging them too much,"" Master tells her.

""I'm not talking about letting them cum whenever they ask for it, but it's an important part of bonding with them. Letting them cum under your command lets them know who they really belong to. And besides, you have to remind her what it's like,"" she explains to him.

""You think she's forgotten what orgasms are like?"" Master chuckles a little.

I absolutely haven't, but if Miss Clara wants to remind me, I'm not going to correct her.

""Not forgotten, they remember that it feels good, but you should let them cum at least once with you, so they're reminded how good the feeling is, and associate it with being something that only you can give them,"" she tells him, wrapping her arms around my waist, my body now completely in her lap, ""It's not about indulging them, as much as making the chastity work as intended. I mean, part of the reason you deny her is to keep her body and mind ready to please you at any time, right? For the denial to be appropriately poignant, there has to be need, her libido has to be strong. And a good orgasm just once will make sure it's there.""

Master taps his fingers on his teeth, ""I don't know.""

She gives him the puppy-dog eyes and pulls my face alongside hers, ""I promise, when you finally do fuck her pussy, it'll make it better. She'll want to cum again so much more, and the strain of holding back will make her body that much more pleasurable. Plus, I really want to see it. Please? For me? If you want to never let her cum after this, I won't bother you about it. But just this once?""

That, um, went to a darker place real quick.

Master sighs, relenting, ""Okay, okay. You're hard to say no to, you know that?""

She jumps a little in her seated position and giggles, kissing my cheek, then immediately starts unbuttoning my dress, ""Thank you, baby!""

I'm a bit stunned, honestly. Is this really happening? I'm not the only one, Lucy and Piper are just staring at us while Clara undresses me and pulls back the blanket to reveal my body.

Master scoots over in front of us and enters the combination into my chastity belt. I shiver as the cool air his my exposed pussy.

""How did you want her to cum for us?"" he asks Clara, leaning in and kisses her, their faces right beside mine.

""I was, um, hoping you would do it,"" Clara grins, a little shyly, then runs her tongue over her teeth, as if specifying the method, ""While I hold her for you.""

I shiver again as her fingers drift over stomach and between my legs, touching my moist pussy for the first time, and spreading it wide for Master.

I'm unsure at first. Is this right? Should he be doing this? A human, lowering himself to perform oral sex on an elf? He really shouldn't be. It's sort of debased, isn't it? I should say something. I really should.

But I don't. Of course I don't. The words aren't going to come out of my mouth, even if I want them to. And of course, I have no right to stop him, if he wants to do this. So I just wait.

It feels like an eternity. Just waiting for him to start. Part of me doesn't believe he actually will, that this is just a tease, but that fades when I feel the warmth of his breath against my pussy. I close my eyes and bite my lip.

""Ow!"" I hear two voices yelp in unison, the only two people I'm not currently touching.

Clara snickers a little over my shoulder, ""Be careful, Lucy.""

""What was that?"" Lucy demands.

""Well, I was told that you can't be trusted with anyone's genitals, so I got my hands on a special lock for his chastity cage - actually, made by the company your master's aunt started, now that I think of it,"" Clara explains, and I'm glad to know mistress is able to spite Lucy for me from beyond the grave, ""It'll give you a little shock if you try to damage it.""

Lucy crosses her arms and pouts.

""But... but why did it shock me, too?"" Piper asks, rather pitifully.

""I may not have installed it right. Sorry,"" Clara tells him, ""But that's not really important right now. What's important is that your little cock is protected from demonic predations.""

""So,"" Lucy says, not quiet enough for us not to hear, as she reaches a hand behind Piper, ""She put any devices back here?""

""Lucy,"" Master says, in his command voice, ""Sit where we can see you.""

He points to the edge of the bed, beside us. Reluctantly, Lucy moves over with a huff, and examines my position. Piper, rather wisely, chooses the position opposite from her. I wasn't really expecting a close audience for this.

""Fine. But I get next,"" she declares. I'm not sure she means my position or Master's.

""I promise nothing,"" Master tells her.

I don't get a moment to worry about being watched, however. In but a second, I feel Miss Clara's fingers spread me wide open again, and before I realize what's happening, Master's lips are on me. I gasp sharply as I feel his hot tongue press inside of me. My back arches and my hips rise, nearly lifting me from the mattress if it weren't for Clara's arms snaking around my waist and pulling me back to her.

""That good, huh?"" Clara giggles into my ear. She has no idea.

Or maybe she does? I had assumed Master had not done this before, but now that I think of it, that might be a little naive. He confirmed that he hasn't had sex with her yet, but he could have gone down on her. I mean, surely Master would have told me if he had. I think. And ideally, as his elf, I should be there when he does.

Did he eat out Miss Clara? Did he press his lips between her legs and make her writhe and squirm and moan for him? Somehow, thinking of him doing it to her really gets me going. Is that normal? To be having a sex act done to you, and imagine the other person with someone else? These are questions I'm not equipped to answer in my current state.

He -is- really good at this. Then again, I've been denied and teased for so long, so maybe I can't tell. I did feel like I was going to pop the moment his tongue touched me. And this is my beloved human Master we're talking about, actually going down on his little elf. Maybe Lucy is right, and I am a depraved slut for human cock and am obsessed with my master. Not that she can ever know that.

It takes some more giggling from Clara to let me know how loud I'm being, ""Enjoying yourself?"" she asks me.

My response is a mumbling, unintelligible mess, to the point that even I'm not even sure what I'm trying to say. She just giggles again and nibbles the tip of my ear. I can feel the eyes of both Lucy and Piper on me out of the corners of my eyes. They're both quiet, just staring at me while Master performs a magic that I never taught him. I can see them both clenching their fists and rubbing against their thighs, both unable to access their genitals. For a moment, I almost feel a little smug about it, but I know how easily the situation can change.

And he hasn't really even gotten started. His tongue fucks me and his lips massage me, but he hasn't touched my clit yet. Once the absence occurs to me, my hands start to drift between my legs, to rub and my little button. But Miss Clara is having none of that. Her hands immediately find mine, and she gently but firmly clasps them, our fingers intertwining in each hand.

""No, no, no,"" she whispers, ""Be a good elf, take what you're given. He'll get to that when he's ready.""

I whimper, half in protest and half in the pleasure I get from her commanding me. She just giggles again, and I can feel her lips wrap around the tip of my ear, toying with it, using her tongue. My clit throbs hard against the air, desperate for attention.

For awhile, I just stare down at Master while he does his work. It's mesmerizing, the idea of anything touching my pussy, much less my master's mouth. And then he does it. One second, my needy little swollen nub is frustrated and alone, and the next, their surrounded by warm, soft human lips. I cry out and my body arches again, my fingers clenching down tight on Clara's, to the point that I'm afraid that I'll hurt her. But of course, I'm sure my little elven grip is nothing she can't handle.

The room spins with the motion of his tongue swirling around my clit. I can hardly get in enough air as my chest heaves up and down, bouncing around my pert breasts. I'm sure it's quite a display, but I don't have the faculties to be embarrassed right now. A thick human finger slides up into my pussy, a tight fit, and my body clenches down like he's given me his cock. For a moment, he tries a second, but can't even get to the first knuckle. My body's tension will not allow it, and he quickly gives up, instead opting to begin thrusting the single digit. The fact that he can't even get two fingers inside arouses and frightens me. If just one finger is so tight, what will his cock do to me?

I'm finally at my limit. I've been at the point that I can cum for awhile now, but now there's no way for me to hold back. The thought of how his cock would devastate my little body is too much.

""I... I need to!"" I force out.

""Yes...?"" Miss Clara whispers into my ear.

""Please! I need to cum! Please Mistress, may I cum!"" I cry out, desperately.

She releases one of my hands and grasps Master's head by the hair, pulling him tight to my pussy, ""Cum for us, Lorelei. Give us your orgasm.""

And then, before my release, her voice dips into a husky tone and she whispers right into my ear, ""Enjoy it. It will be your last one.""

Those devious, wicked, terrifying words push me right over the edge, and I scream. My body bucks and spasms and shakes so hard that both Master and Miss Clara have trouble holding onto me. My pussy pulses and clenches so hard that it's almost painful. I scream and cry and gasp, struggling to catch any breath as my body thrashes. My pussy thrusts against Master's lips, covering his face with my juices as he continues to assault me with his tongue and fingers.

I don't know how long it lasts, but when it subsides, I'm a sweaty, dripping, delirious mess. Miss Clara scoops me up like the puddle of elf that I am, and lovingly kisses along my neck and shoulders.

""I think she was a little pent up,"" she says to Master, who looks up at us with his face glistening.

He crawls forward, his face moving right past mine and grasping Miss Clara softly by the back of the head and pulling her in for a passionate kiss. They sandwich me between their warm bodies as they kiss, tongues entwining, his mouth covered in my pussy. It's a moment I wish could last forever, but when their lips finally part, and they lay side by side, my body between them, the gravity of Miss Clara's words hits me.

""Miss Clara,"" I say, meekly, ""You didn't really mean... never again, did you?""

She shrugs casually, giving me a soft kiss on the lips, tasting of my own body, ""I don't know, maybe. It's really up to your master, and what I can convince him is best. Now that you've had one for him, you don't really need to anymore.""

I can't quite find words. She kisses me again and lays back.

""Speaking of things that are best, I've been thinking,"" she says, looking at Master, ""And while I am excited to see you with other girls, be they regular women, elves, catgirls, or what have you, I'm not really sure that having sex with demons is a really great idea. Letting her suck your cock and the like is no big deal, but I don't know about actual, proper, vaginal sex. It seems a little, I don't know, degenerate. It doesn't seem right. I don't think you should do that.""

The room gets deathly quiet for a long moment.

""Beg. Pardon."" Lucy finally says in a deep, terse tone. Even I haven't got as intense of a stare as she's giving Clara.

Master starts to laugh, ""Clara, please stop teasing my girls, they don't know well enough when you're joking.""

She laughs in return and rolls over on top of him, her ample breasts managing to smash into my face in the short journey, ""Consider it payback. Piper is still a little afraid of you, you know. He still isn't completely convinced you weren't serious.""

They laugh together for a few moments as the tension leaves the room, before she sits up, straddling over Master's chest, ""Okay, my turn!""",,2025-08-15T19:21:10.854987,3368,

WARNING:

This chapter will get much more sexually intense. It includes scenes of bondage, masochism, degradation, and strong language.

Katie

The walls were white, just like Master's cum. Her clothes were white, just like Master's cum. When the orderlies stripped her and bathed her, she saw how close her skin was to milky white. Those women who washed her always wore electric green scrubs to distinguish them from patients. Katie thought they would look better in white.

On a normal day, she woke from her dreams of Master and tried to reach for her cunt, but she couldn't reach. The straps only went so far, and the best she could do was tug on her hair just to feel something. Ever since she'd rubbed herself to blood, they made sure she could masturbate no more. It took a while, but she learned never to try while they were watching. It was simply futile.

But Master could help her cum, and she never had to touch herself at all. Katie remembered how it felt in the beginning, when it seemed only like dreams, or fragmented memories. But the more cum he gifted, the stronger the visions became. And soon Katie could

see

what he was doing to new, obedient sluts. And then she could

hear

what he said, what they screamed, the friction of skin on skin. At last, dozens of women later, Katie could feel everything they felt in his presence. The light touches on the arm, the furious pounding in their tight wet cunts, the light caress of Master's breath on their ears.

And then one day, it stopped. But now he was back, to remind Katie how he felt and prepare her for the day he would come take her away.

""How are you feeling today?"" the Nurse Gretchen asked.

""He's back,"" Katie tried telling her. ""He woke up again, and he's going to come let me out of here so we can be together again.""

""Katie, why do you think this happened after so long? I thought we were really getting somewhere.""

""Because he

did

,"" she said firmly, arms resting at her sides, free.

I could fuck myself right now,

she thought.

If only for a few seconds.

Her cunt was always ready for it, at least. ""I know you'll never believe me. But he stopped working for years because he thought he didn't want to, and now he's started doing it again. He knows it's almost time to come get me.""

""What has he been doing, Katie?""

She pressed her lips together to hold in her smile. They hated when she was happy, they always tried to do something to take away her fun. ""He's been collecting all his old toys,"" she said. ""I told you all about them before. But now he's got a few new ones. Erica and Natalie. They tasted him, and now they belong to him. Just like me.""

""Also girls he went to school with?""

""Erica is, but not Natalie. Natalie was Alex's roommate.""

""And Alex is...""

""His

ex

. You should know that.""

""I'm sorry Katie, it's been many years since you've talked about any specifics.""

""Then go get your stupid notes. I'm not explaining all of this again.""

""Just tell me what's new,"" the nurse said.

""His girlfriend Penny woke him up again. She swallowed his... erm, semen, and he started feeling his power again. Everyone who ever let their cum inside them is rushing to please him again.""

""And you would go as well,"" the nurse said. ""If you could.""

""I would have gone years ago,"" Katie sulked. ""He wouldn't have needed any of the others if they'd just let me stay with him.""

""Which

they

, Katie?""

""My parents. The stupid doctors they had look at me.

You

."" They were all to blame. Katie only wanted to serve her Master, but they decided she needed psychiatric help. Katie could still remember the last time they saw one another, never knowing it would be the end.

""No matter where we are in ten years,"" she said, ""Let's just run away somewhere else. Start a new life, just us.""

And it was almost time. Just six more months, and they would run away together.

""Katie, why do you think he's come back into your head like this? Are you maybe just getting too lonely? Perhaps you could benefit from some socializing.""

""I don't need friends,"" Katie spat. ""I just need my Master.""

Nurse Gretchen sighed and stood up, walking to the door. Katie almost sighed in relief, thinking that the bitch was finally leaving. But instead, she opened the white cushioned door and showed a tall, buxom woman inside.

No, not really a woman. She must be around my age, maybe a little older.

""Katie, this is Dr. Kisch. She and I have been talking for a while and we agree that you might do well if you just get to talk things out with someone new.""

""Doctor,"" Katie repeated, scornfully. ""You must be pretty new.""

""Yes,"" Dr. Kisch said. ""I just finished my degree a few weeks ago, in fact. I hope that's all right.""

""I don't like doctors,"" Katie told her.

""I can understand that. Maybe you should just call me Emily, then.""

Katie rolled her eyes. ""Fine. Hi

Emily.""

She made the word sound like a curse.

With a nod, Emily sent the nurse out of the room. She did not pull up a notebook or a tape recorder like the others, she did not hook her up to a machine or hand her a dixie cup full of pills. Emily just sat in the chair the nurse brought in and started to relax.

""What a bunch of stiffs,"" she said. ""They kept looking at me like they were going to commit me if I didn't do

everything

perfect.""

""They would,"" Katie said, letting out a huff of air that almost sounded like a laugh.

""Maybe. They'd probably have their hands full with me.""

""You 'crazy' too?""

""Bonkers,"" Emily grinned. ""I have the audacity to enjoy sex a little. Like it's a crime or something.""

Katie leaned forward a little. ""What... what do you like?""

""Lots of stuff,"" Emily said, very matter of fact. She must not have known just how desperate Katie was to hear anything of the sort. ""I masturbate pretty regularly. I watch internet porn. All kinds of videos, too. Orgies, exhibitionism, lesbians. It's

supposed

to be a normal thing for a woman to do.""

""It is,"" Katie agreed. ""What else do you do?""

""Well, I don't want to scare

you

off. You're not like them, but admittedly I am a bit out there.""

Katie leaned forward and looked Emily directly in the eyes, making sure not to blink. ""Please,"" she said. ""Tell me.""

Emily smiled bashfully, kicked her feet back and forth under her chair, and said, ""Well, I'll do just about anything, I guess. As long as there's cum involved. I have a serious cum addiction.""

Oh, Master

, Katie thought.

This one could be very useful. And look at that, she's wearing white.

**********

Alex

She arrived in Master's bedroom to find Lily giddy and fondling her own breasts. Hearing the story about how she'd grown two cup sizes in a couple minutes, Alex was not surprised.

Master can do anything.

Master took her by the shoulders and kissed her on the head. ""How's Natalie?"" he asked.

""Sleeping,"" Alex responded. ""She really wasn't expecting it to work. I know she's going to be so happy here.""

""Good,"" he said. Penny gave her a peck on the cheek, and they all hopped into bed together. While she and Penny snuggled under each of Master's arms, Lily knelt in front of them on the mattress and continued to massage her new breasts. She never stopped smiling.

""What do you say, Lily?"" Penny asked her.

""

Thank you Master!""

she said, biting her lip and bouncing up and down. They were just a little smaller than Alex's but bounced so nicely that she found herself feeling jealous.

They're so perky and smooth

, she thought.

Maybe... maybe Master will help me too?

""Girls,"" Master said. ""I want you to know that I'm not going to do this for everyone all the time.""

Master always knows what I'm thinking. He's so amazing.

But...

""If I do too much then it's just going to start a slippery slope. But I can do a little. One change, just one.""

""You won't make them bigger?"" Penny asked.

Master watched closely as Lily started tugging on her nipples, watching just how far out they could go. ""I'll make them as big as she wants,"" he said. ""But once she says to stop, that's it.""

""Really?"" Lily said, looking away from herself at last. ""You'll make them even

bigger

? They're so huge already!""

""As much as you want,"" Master repeated.

Her expression faded into a look of desire, directed at Master's eyes. She crawled across the duvet and kissed him on the lips gently, though she looked feverish. Alex had almost forgotten his kisses, and found herself wanting to do the same. When Lily pulled away, and she saw the smile on Penny's face, Alex did not resist the urge to turn Master's face to her and kiss him deeply.

He always kept his face smooth, and his lips were much fuller than the average man without looking pouty. The taste of his lips was always unique, but age had turned it from sweet into something much more intoxicating and raw. Pulling away was as difficult as climbing a mountain.

""And what can I do for you, Alex?"" he asked.

""Well, um..."" She was still reeling herself in from the kiss. The air in her lungs meant nothing for her ability to speak or think.

""Maybe,"" Penny said. ""She would like to be smaller. Ever since you taught her how submissive she is, she's always wanted to be as small as you make her feel.""

That was true. Alex was an inch taller than Master, which of course was not really an issue. But she always knew that she would feel even more helpless if she were as short as the other girls he'd been with. Lauren was nearly the same height, sure. But Lanie was a good three inches shorter, and Penny almost half a foot if not completely. What Master lacked in height he made up for in every conceivable way. But it was still the one thing that kept her from a perfect state of submission.

He must have told Penny all about me

, she realized.

That's how she knew. Penny is so smart, so beautiful. She's going to be a wonderful Mistress.

""Yes,"" Alex said at last. ""Thank you, Mistress Penny.""

""How much smaller would you like to be?"" Master asked.

""Maybe... six inches?"" But no, that wouldn't do. Charlie was her Master, but Penny was also her Mistress. Someday she hoped that Penny would use her just as freely, just as intensely. Shouldn't she be smaller than her as well? ""Actually, maybe just an inch or two shorter than Mistress Penny.""

He pressed his lips together into a thin line and thought hard. ""That's going to take a lot of effort,"" he said. ""It won't happen all at once.""

""That's okay, Master! I can wait as long as you want me to.""

""I'll finish with Lily first,"" he said. ""And once that's done, I'll start bathing you.""

""Bathing me, Master?""

""With a change that drastic, I'll have to make your entire body shrink, otherwise I'm just shortening your legs. You don't want to be disproportionate, do you?""

""No!""

""Then you'll have to take cum baths. One every night until you're down to five feet.""

Penny moaned at the sound of that. Her lips were parted, and her hand was moving around under the duvet. She was stroking Master's cock, and had been for a few minutes now. Lily straightened up again and started playing some more. ""That sounds like heaven,"" Lily said.

""When you're all done,"" Penny said, eyes narrowed at Alex, ""I'm going to break you. Personally.""

**********

Lanie

""I'm sorry,"" she said again. Ashley was still silent behind the wheel.

Why am I apologizing?

Lanie wondered.

I'm supposed to be her Mistress.

""Say something,"" Lanie tried.

""You could have gotten hurt,"" Ashley said at last. It was not a long ride from the police station back to the house, but her silence made every inch of it feel like a mile. ""Or killed, god forbid.""

""I just... I just needed it,"" she said. That was true. It took a reminder every now and then, but someone was always there to let her know just how desperately she needed to pleasure someone or be fucked. She'd been gone for more than a day, first fucking Preston and his friends, then the men around her former apartment complex. They were all so nice to help her remember her place.

Ashley's brow furrowed. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I just wish you could have waited to get home.""

""But Master said... to make sure everything was taken care of.""

""Maybe we should talk to Master,"" Ashley said. ""Maybe he should be more clear about these things.""

""I can't disobey him,"" Lanie said firmly.

""No! Never. But... I just mean that... he wants us to be safe, right? So he should just be a little more careful with us. I don't know...""

""Are you going to tell him?""

Ashley turned into the driveway at last and took Lanie's hand. ""There was a police report, Lanie. I have to tell him.""

None of it seemed so bad, except how tired she was. When one man was finished with her she would inevitably be sent down the hall to the next, or maybe kept in one room for a while as new visitors came to see what all the fuss was about. Lanie loved the attention. After they had all taken their pleasure, a few of them took her to a car and started driving her around town, charging a few bucks to get a look at her, sweaty and bruised and nearing unconsciousness, still desperately squeezing her tits and saying, ""I'm a slut, I'm a slut, I'm such a fucking slut...""

They threw her out of the car an hour later and drove away, leaving Lanie stranded at the strip mall. Luckily, the police had seen the whole thing and taken her in.

""Would you have done any differently?"" Lanie asked.

""No,"" Ashley replied. ""That's why it's scary.""

**********

Lauren

Everyone had their own bedroom, but Lauren fully expected that many of them would remain empty in the evenings. She woke up with Zoe happily nuzzled into her shoulder, moaning lightly from her dreams. Lauren's own dream had been tame compared to her recent experiences. It was an old memory of Master fucking her on the dock at her family cabin one summer, and how they cuddled for hours while they looked at the stars. Only in the dream, Penny and Alex and Lanie were there as well, all holding one another while Master told them sweet folktales from centuries past.

When they were both awake, Lauren and Zoe descended the stairs to find the long dining room table filled with breakfast plates, and some of the girls already happily chowing down. Each seat was labeled by name, and included a small list of what was served for breakfast. ""Lauren: Three strips bacon, eggs over easy, whole wheat toast and almond butter, orange juice no pulp. Please inform the staff of any error, request, or future restriction.""

Across the table, Miranda was cutting through pink pancakes and taking large bites of them. ""I know,"" she said, unprompted. ""Ashley really knows how to run this place.""

Penny walked into the room, eyes still sleepy and hair pulled back into a short ponytail. Lauren had never seen her like that, but thought she looked just beautiful. ""Good morning,"" Lauren said, already taking bites of her bacon.

""Hi..."" Penny moaned groggily. ""Does... anyone know where Charlie -- erm, Master is? I need to talk to him.""

Brie, finished her grapefruit, stood up and took Penny by the hand. ""Here, sleepyhead. Come with me.""

Zoe giggled and took a sip of water. ""She's going to be fun to have around. I heard she's way sluttier than Penny.""

Lauren let out a confused laugh. ""What are you -- oh, right!""

It was not Penny, but her sister. Lauren remembered the commotion as Master conquered a friend of Alex's only to be faced with Sammy's arrival a few moments later. They disappeared into the study for some time, and Lauren didn't see her again.

Looks like she's here to stay.

""I wonder..."" Miranda muttered. ""Do you think he ever fucked them both at the same time?""

The girls around the table

ooo'

d excitedly at the thought. Something about fucking two sisters at once did sound especially exciting. Especially because they were identical, it must have been fun to lose track of which girl was which.

Maybe I'll have to try that later

.

When she finished her breakfast, Lauren adjourned alone to her bedroom and started to look at the equipment that Ashley bought her. It really was her dream rig, already plugged in and operational. With this, she could produce hours upon hours of music without ever needing to rely on someone else. Even if her tracks never saw the light of day, she could be happy writing and experimenting for days on end.

While she fiddled away with all the functions of her soundboards and mixers and microphones, she lost track of time. It was nearly noon when there was a knock on the door.

It was Alex, ""Lauren, it's Lanie. Ashley picked her up at the police station this morning.""

Lanie returned wearing some of Ashley's clothes, looking haggard and exhausted. The servants personally carried her to her new bedroom, and she stayed in there, sleeping all day long. Ashley went upstairs immediately and disappeared into Master's room. Lauren and a few of the girls listened at the door, but they only heard quiet talking.

When they went to check on Lanie, Alex lifted her bedsheets to find her naked and covered in bruises. ""Oh my god..."" Lauren muttered.

""I know,"" Alex said. ""That lucky slut.""

**********

Penny

She went exploring again, trying to find all the secrets the house held. The servant's quarters were nothing more than a locker room, where she found the shift schedule of more than fifty employed housekeepers, security guards, and kitchen attendants. During the day, more than half of them would be around the house at any given time, reducing to a mere fifth by midnight and until dawn. But surely all of them knew what had changed around the house.

Maybe they'll have to be reminded of their discretion

, Penny thought. But then again, this might be a surprisingly normal thing to happen in a house like this.

Just when she was ready to disrobe and go for a swim, Penny found a door hidden beneath the staircase in the foyer. It was painted with matte black paint, so not even a gleam of light could give away its position. But up close, the door was quite normal, not meant to be secret as much as out of sight. At the bottom of the stone steps was a dimly lit wine cellar, almost completely emptied out over the years that Ashley lived alone. Only one collection of vintage wines remained, dust covered and tucked into one corner.

The other wine racks were pushed against the walls, leaving thousands of square feet of open space. The touch of cold on her bare feet, the windy sound of the draft from the stairs, the dampness in the air all reminded Penny of a fairy tale princess trapped in a cave with an evil monster.

Trapped, maybe tied up. Maybe naked. Maybe happy to be there.

""Mistress Penny?""

""Hello Ashley."" She was standing at the bottom of the stairs in a business casual blouse and skirt, hands folded and eyes nervous. ""How is Lanie feeling?""

""She's still sleeping,"" Ashley said. ""But she's okay. She was more tired than actually hurt, thank god. Um... Master is going to the precinct to discuss what happened. He's asking if you want to go with him.""

She turned that over in her head for a moment, but decided against it. Charlie always knew what he was doing, and in this Penny trusted him more than herself. In part because he was better at talking to people, getting his ideas across, but also because she found herself peculiarly disinterested.

""No, I'll stay here,"" Penny said. ""One of us should always be around, don't you think?""",,2025-08-15T19:21:43.177504,3481,
https://www.literotica.com/s/lisas-impact-on-our-lives-ch-04,Lisa's Impact on Our Lives Ch. 04,Unknown Author,,,,,"A few days had passed since out last encounter. The ongoing debauchery, which was now my life, hadn't stopped. The two main highlights had been a rim job I gave Chris while Lisa blew him and me servicing Lisa for Chris' viewing pleasure.

Chris had said it was one of the best blowjobs he had ever got. I hope that is because the rim job added to the pleasure.

Lisa had talked me into going down on her as Chris would love to watch that. He did, he ended up jacking off over top of us and cumming on the back of my head.

This made Lisa laugh and state, ""He missed my cunt because your head was in the way!""

I understood the dynamics had changed a little. We were all playing different roles. There were times I thought Lisa was a little cruel to me or seemed to be taking advantage of our new 'group' arrangement. Chris was happy, I enjoyed him being happy, knowing I was playing a part to make that happen.

What I was still struggling with was its permanence. Was this how we were now? I longed for the time when it was just Chris and I cuddling in bed. But even that longing was fueling something inside of me. I enjoyed the longing. I felt a buzz when Lisa inserted herself between Chris and me. The phrase 'it isn't the kill, it's the thrill of the chase' had been coming to mind often. When I watched them together my heart sped up, I felt anxious and jumpy, and of course my panties dampened a little. The longing to be sought after, like Chris sought after Lisa, was feeding my desire.

Right now, I wasn't unhappy with the way things were. Part of me felt more connected to my relationship with Chris that I had been before. The difference between activity working on a relationship and just going through the motions. It was confusing, why did we need another woman in the relationship to make it work? Maybe I needed to see someone to talk this out. Wasn't sure how that would work 'Hello Doctor, can you help me sort out a three-way with my boyfriend, his lover and me?'

Today was my birthday. Chris kissed me when I woke up and wished a Happy Birthday. Then Lisa did the same thing. She kissed me a lot lately. Her kisses were different than Chris'. Although passionate, her kisses had an element of a parent kissing a child. I always expected a pat on the head and 'good girl' added afterward. I know that sounds confusing, but it is just as hard to describe. Parent and child wasn't the best example, master and pet seemed to fit better.

We moved ourselves to the living room and Lisa brought out coffee. Even this was a little disconcerting, I almost felt I could get in trouble for not getting the coffees myself.

Chris popped back into the bedroom and came out with a small pile of presents.

""These are from us,"" Chris said proudly while he handed them to me, ""being honest, Lisa picked out most of them.""

I thanked them and opened the first box. Inside was a very nice leather skirt in a dark burgundy. The leather was so soft, and it was well made. The second box had was from our 'adult' store, I recognized the logo immediately. I wondered if Chris had picked out this one and it was some new toy. To my surprise it was lingerie wrapped nicely in tissue paper. Taking it out of the box I noted it was a bra and panty set. The bra was a quarter cup model that would push up my breasts but not cover my nipples. The panties made it matching set as they were crotchless. For the uninitiated crotchless panties are just panties with the crotch missing. They are a patch of material in the front with strips of ribbon to hold them in place. One ribbon around the waist and two running from the patch to the waist on my back. Essentially, nothing is covering my crease from end to end. It was very pretty in a lovey lacey white.

The last box contained a beautiful silk blouse. It weighed almost nothing and felt like a cloud in my hands.

""This is all very beautiful!"" I finally said, ""Thank you very much.""

""Try them on,"" Lisa encouraged me, ""I hope I got all the sizes right.""

I went back to the bedroom to change. A nagging thought entered my mind. When did they buy all this? Did they do it together? I put that aside for now and started to get dressed.

Once I had everything on, I looked in the mirror. I couldn't argue with their choices, I looked hot.

The first issue I noticed was the incompatibility of the bra and blouse. The blouse was shear and my nipples were clearly visible through the material. The softness of the silk also made my nipples hard, that didn't help. The billowing of the blouse meant if I leaned forward the top would hang away from my boobs and couldn't see anything. The moment I put my shoulders back the material pressed against my nipples making they clearly visible. Would need a different bra to wear this outside.

The skirt was what might be called a pencil skirt. It was tight, tapered and stopped about half a foot from my knee. Or a better description is it stopped about half a foot from my crotch.

I was sex on display. In the closest I found a nice pair of white, three inches, pumps. They went well with the outfit. I hadn't had a chance to do my hair or makeup, so as sexy as I looked, I also looked like I had just been ravished behind the dumpster.

Walking back into the living room I immediately got a wolf whistle from Chris.

""Wow, that's hot!"" Chris exclaimed.

""Doesn't she look great!"" Lisa agreed.

""Need a different bra for public."" I laughed.

""Not you don't!"" Lisa cut me off, ""Let's get some breakfast.""

I was super careful not to get anything on my new blouse and ate less breakfast because of it. Chris spent most of the breakfast time opening staring at my tits. It was nice to have his attention.

""Big day ahead!"" Lisa announced, ""We have it all planned. Lunch at Ricky's by the waterfront. A few hours at the spa, I have you booked for a facial Jen, and then dinner and dancing into the evening.

Chris be a darling and clear the table, Jen and I need to pack a bag for the day.""

Lisa had me pick out a nice summer dress lunch and the spa.

""Pack your new clothes, we can change at the spa. Leave the panties on bra on.""

Even in the dress I put on I felt exposed. The bra and panties meant my nipples rubbed against my dress, and the air flowed up from beneath.

I pulled my hair into a ponytail for now and put on some light make-up.

Chris had a shower and then dressed into a hansom summer suit. Opting for a t-shirt instead of a dress shirt. He looked wonderful.

Luckily, I had packed the pumps as well as we decided to walk through the park on the way to Ricky's. The wind flirted with my dress, and I began to worry I might be exposed in the next gust. My normal choice of panties didn't come with this issue. A strong breeze in the dress and people might find out I shop at Old Navy. The upshot of all this is I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about my underwear or lack of underwear.

""Oh my God!"" Lisa suddenly exclaimed when we reached the middle of the park, ""We forgot the birthday paddling.""

If you are unfamiliar this is a tradition in a lot of places, though normally reserved for children. You get slapped on the ass for every year you have been alive.

I couldn't remember the last time I got my ass paddled for my birthday. I am sure I stopped in grade 8 after young Jimmy Lucus let his hand rest a little too long after each smack.

""I am good,"" I tried to laugh it off, ""I will risk the bad luck.""

""No way,"" said Lisa, ""assume the position.""

She pointed me to a tree and told me to grab the trunk. I did as I was told and felt my dress being lifted. Looking around there was no one in sight. I really hoped it stayed that way.

Lisa applied the first smack, hard on my left cheek. Chris hadn't been paying attention, I guess, as she slapped the same cheek, hard. Lisa swapped sides and landed another blow. They went on and on like this until my ass was bright red and felt warm to the touch. Lisa applied the last swap and rubbed the area on both cheeks. As much as the slaps themselves stung the warm feeling afterward was nice.

""...and one for good luck!"" Lisa shouted and landed her hand directly between my legs.

Currents shot through my body. Like Jimmy before her, Lisa let her hand rest after delivering the blow. She used her palm to rub my crotch and I felt the warmth rush into my lips and clitoris.

Her last movement was to poke a finger inside my now wet vagina and moan in my ear.

""Come on,"" Lisa said jumping back, ""Let's get going.""

Lisa skipped ahead like she was dancing. I brushed my dress back into place and focused on the warmth still on my bum.

Lunch was nice and we ended up finishing a bottle of rose between us. Just enough to make us a little giggly. The spa was close enough to walk and the fresh air cleaned our heads after lunch.

The spa was one of those larges Swedish places that had pools, saunas and places to relax in a dark room. We had planned our facial for the end of our visit so for the next couple of hours it was saunas and plunge pools. The place had three sections: man's, woman's, and group. The men's and women's section were clothing optional. Strangely, group required bottoms to be warn. Women walking around topless was fine. Chris was going to love that assuming the view was nice. A view of perky tits can be ruined by saggy tits on a 70-year-old man.

In the change room we stripped down.

""I am staying in the woman's section,"" Lisa told me, ""No need for anything, come with me.""

It was a command, not an ask. I put everything into the locker, and we walked out naked. I had seen Lisa naked many times, especially in the last while. But training along behind her I felt a little exposed.

There were about a dozen women milling about. I have always been a bit fascinated in these situations who grooms and in what way. I snuck a peak around the room and saw a few smooth, a few with a landing strip, and other with neatly trimmed pubes.

One lady had to be in her 60s, but in stunning shape. Her hair was beautiful silver and grey, I wondered it that was natural, or she had it died that way. I had been wondering recently what I would do when I got to that age. Go grey gracefully or keep my colour even if it was from a bottle.

I also noticed her pubic hair was grey and thin. Maybe it was all natural. She looked great.

One of the women looked younger than the rest. The age limit in the place as 18 and they checked ID. Still, she had a look to her that made her look younger than anyone else there. She was thin with very small breasts. I had expected her to be smooth for some reason, probably to match her looks, but she had a very hairy and untrimmed bush. She also had hair under her arms. Something about her looked so natural, it made her look really sexy.

Lisa saw who I was looking at and remarked, ""She's hot, isn't she. Wouldn't you love to have her for you very own?""

""What?"" I looked at Lisa confused.

""A little slave to take care of you?"", Lisa mused, ""have her wash you in the morning, massage you when wanted, and pleasure you when you needed it. Don't get me wrong, I love cock, but having a cute thing like that working on your folds whenever you wanted would be nice.""

As I listen to Lisa, I was actually a little jealous. I had done all those things for her, was I not cute enough?

Lisa saw the look on my face and smiled, ""Relax,"" she said, ""I am not prepared to give you up. Now watch this, let's see what happens.""

Lisa stared at the woman until she got her attention. Slowly she ran one finger down her body as if pointing the way. When she arrived at her pussy, she pushed her finger through her lips and between her legs.

The woman's face turned red, but she didn't look away. Lisa started rubbing circles around her clit and biting her lower lip. The woman didn't take her eyes away and was now taking too long between blinks.

""Come on,"" Lisa gestured, ""this could be fun.""

We walked over to the women.

""Hi, I'm Lisa,"" Lisa said when she arrived, ""This is my playmate, Jen.""

""Becky."" The woman said, sticking out her hand for a formal handshake.

""Pleasure to meet you, Becky."" Lisa said, taking her hand and rubbing the finger, she had just had inside her, around her palm.

""Becky, Jen and I are going for a dip on the pools, would you like to join us?"" Lisa smiled at her.

Becky nodded, and we walked over to the pool section.

We did an ice plunge first. The water was so cold it felt like it burned. Every part of me had goosebumps and my nipple could have easily cut glass. After a minute we moved over the warm baths.

The heat flowed in nicely and I felt like I was in a warm bed.

Lisa motioned us to come and sit next to her. Becky was between us looking a little nervous.

""How often do you come here Becky?"" Lisa asked.

""First time here."" Becky replied.

""Oh really, well I hope you come back often. It really is a great way to relax and meet people."" Lisa smile stroking back her hair.

""You really are a small thing,"" Lisa told her, ""So cute, everything compact.""

Lisa rubbed her shoulder on the side next to her. She then worked her hand down and cupped one of her small breasts.

""These are so elegant, I bet you never have to wear a bra,"" Lisa commented, ""so sexy!""

Lisa pinched one of her nipples lightly and Becky moaned.

""Touch one,"" Lisa commanded me, ""they are small and compact, but so nice to hold.""

I did what was asked. I reached under the water and cupped her other breast. I wasn't a connoisseur of woman's breast, only having held only a few and two of them had been my own. They felt firm, but soft. Her nipples stood out and I couldn't resist the urge to give one a light squeeze. Becky moaned and lay her head back.

We were in the corner of the room and a half retaining wall restricted the view from the rest of the area. Still, I kept an eye out for anyone coming.

""I love the hair under you arms,"" Lisa commented, ""I wish this could make a comeback, it really is sexy on women. I noticed you like to keep all your hair.""

Lisa reached under the water and gave Becky's pubes a light tug. Becky moaned a little and was made to scoot forward a little. Soon I could tell Lisa was doing more than just rubbing Becky's pubes.

Becky turned her head and kissed Lisa passionately. When she was done, she turned my way and I found myself in a deep, tongue sparing, kiss with Becky.

It wasn't long until Becky was moaning.

""Oh fuck,"" She said out loud, ""Oh please, please.""

Becky crested hard and I almost put my hand over her mouth so we wouldn't be discovered.

She hugged Lisa and shivered out the last waves of pleasure.

""Oh, that was fun,"" Becky moaned.

""First time with a woman's hand?"" Lisa asked.

""No,"" Becky replied, ""but I haven't had too much experience. Want me to return the favour?""

""That would be lovely,"" Lisa replied, ""just a moment.""

Lisa pushed herself out of the pool, so she was sitting on the ledge. She quickly swung her leg over Becky's head collecting her between.

""Come give me a good licking."" Lisa said.

Becky looked generally shocked for a moment. I assumed Becky had some experience fingering a girlfriend or two, but I wasn't sure how much time she had spent face down between another women's legs.

I guess she didn't want to seem rude or inexperienced, so she tentatively moved closer and stuck out her tongue. Lisa put a hand on the back of her head and pulled her closer.

""Oh yeah sweetie,"" Lisa whimpered, ""make me feel good. Jen, come over here and play with my tits a little.""

People get arrested for what we were doing here. I assume. Maybe this was normal here, I hadn't been to this spa before or really anything like it. The last spa I had gone to was a family spa at one of those vacation places. Wasn't a lot of this going on there.

I moved next to Lisa and squeezed her boob like I knew she liked. I put two fingers around her nipple and gently tugged outward.

""Put a finger in me honey."" Lisa said to Becky.

Looking down at Becky I realized this was the exact scenario Lisa had described when we first saw her. Lisa had saw what she wanted and get and got it.

Lisa had what could best be described as a controlled orgasm. She moaned while holding Becky's head in place and then let go.

""Oh, that was nice,"" she said as if commenting on the weather.

Becky looked up at me questioning if she was going to have to perform again.

""Don't worry about Jen sweetie,"" Lisa answered the unspoken question. ""I will take care of her later.""

I didn't necessarily want the woman, who I had just met, to get me off. However, the whole scene had made me horny. I reached to touch my own pussy and Lisa slapped my hand.

""Leave yourself alone for five minutes will you."" Lisa chided me.

Lisa smiled at me with a knowing smile, like she had just gotten away with a prank.

""Becky, it was great getting to know you this afternoon."" Lisa said, ""Love to see you again, would you leave you number with the receptionist before you leave?""

""Yes,"" Becky stammered, ""Love to see you again.""

Becky had this look like she had just be shooed out of the room for no reason. Lisa and she kissed again, before Becky left the area, we were in.

""Come on,"" Lisa said to me, ""let's go see what Chris is up to.""

We grabbed a couple of towels to put round out waist and walked over the group section hoping Chris would be there.

The main room was much larger and there were are few more people in there. Soon we spied Chris sitting in one of the relaxation rooms. As we went in another couple left leaving just the three of us.

You were meant to be quiet in the room, but we were the only ones in there.

""Where have you two been?"" Chris asked when he saw us.

""I was getting my pussy licked by a cute young thing Named Becky."" Lisa replied matter-of-factly.

Chris looked to me for confirmation and I simply nodded. Already I could see a bulge developing in his swimsuit.

""She was so cute, 100lbs maybe soaking wet,"" Lisa swooned, ""not a lot of experience, but lots of enthusiasm.""

She glanced at Chris' crotch and knew she had his attention.

""Oh dear,"" Lisa faked a frown, ""has my little story got you bothered?""

Chris looked at her with a 'what do you think' look.

""Jen,"" Lisa commanded me, ""blow you boyfriend, while I tell him the rest, can't have him walking around like that.""

""There are people here."" I resisted.

""Exactly, you want him parading a hard-on about?"" Lisa went on, ""Don't worry, I will keep an eye out.""

We were in a room, so as long as no one came in, we should be safe.

I bent over Chris and took his cock out.

""I got her off first with my fingers,"" Lisa continued her story, ""but she wanted to use her mouth on me.""

Don't believe that was true. She was surprised by it.

Lisa went on, ""at first, she just flicked her tongue about, and it was getting frustrating, I almost had Jen tap in, she is great at eating pussy. But then she started to suck on my button and the magic started. I guess it was like the blowjob you are getting now. She kept suctioning my clit into her mouth and letting it slide out over her wet lips, before pulling it back again. It wasn't the best orgasm I ever had, but it was a nice way to break up the afternoon.""

The location, the story, the risk, all played a part and in no time, Chris had emptied himself onto my mouth.

""All done?"" Lisa asked, ""Great, can we leave you hear for an hour or two, we have treatment booked. Come on Jen.""

Without waiting for a response from either of us, she pulled me out of the room.",,2025-08-15T19:21:51.160063,3701,
https://www.literotica.com/s/my-diary-entry-18-looking-in,My Diary: Entry 18 - Looking In,Unknown Author,,,,,"Hi!

It's Emma.

That was thrilling!

I was out in the city centre just having a look around, and found something I didn't expect: a teen couple looking sweet with each other, obviously smitten, and revelling in soaring hormones. I couldn't help but get closer, wanting to insert myself but not intrude.

Amid the hustle and bustle of passersby, I edged ever closer to them, being sure to keep a watchful eye so they didn't disappear into the crowd. I watched them kissing romantically in the eye of a storm of strangers, and it made my legs weak. I stumbled forward, and burst through the bodies to land at their feet. I scraped my shin along the floor, but not enough to bleed, just shredding the top layer of skin sorely.

The young woman hurried to pick me up, ""Are you okay?""

I blushed so hard, not that they knew it was because I was just stalking them as if a lioness in the tall grass, but I just laughed nervously.

The young man noticed my leg getting redder than my face, ""That needs attention.""

I bravely said, ""I'm fine!""

The young woman offered, ""Mom's a nurse. She can get you cleaned up and dressed. It's not far. We live just around the corner.""

As the young couple propped me up between them, I was so embarrassed, but daren't tell them why. They really were just around the corner in one of the terraces of the old town.

Inside, I was met by the girl's mother, and they explained my situation and their Samaritan role in the event, which impressed the mother, who was about my age. She inspected my leg, and patched me up, and while she did that for me, the young couple left me in the mother's care, disappearing to be young lovers in their room.

After the nurse applied a dressing to my leg, she noticed the wet state of my underwear, asking politely, ""Do you have incontinence issues?""

I became frightfully aware of my situation, and played along, ""If I may go use the toilet?""

She nodded, directing me, ""Upstairs, past the bedrooms, at the end of the landing.""

I put weight on my leg, feeling better now it's been seen to, and I smiled in thanks as I walked past the nurse to go upstairs.

I listened as I past the closed doors of the rooms, wanting to find the young couple. I heard their intense moans, and I gently pushed at the door, swinging it open silently and enough to peek through the slit. I spotted their naked selves rolling around on the bed energetically, both blissfully unaware of my presence...

The young woman arched her back and slung her head as the young man kissed the stretched skin of her neck. She ruffled the hair on the back of his head, and lifted her leg up around his back. Her toes curled and stretched, wriggling as the young man was invited inside.

I barely felt awake, feeling as if in a dream, utterly weightless and devoid of control, having my wants to attend to my surging feelings, but lacking any semblance of will. All I could do was stand with mouth agape at the gaping door, feeling increasingly hot, and feeling my legs quiver with greater frequency. I was begging myself to reach out, and indulge.

The nurse took me by surprise as she came up the stairs, asking me, ""What are you doing?""

I was startled, jumping out of my skin, and I played it off, ""Oh, I was just looking for them to thank them for helping me get what I need.""

The nurse nodded, ""I understand. Have you got yourself sorted out?""

It took a second for me to realise, but I remembered she thought I was incontinent, and I wasn't going to let on it was actually arousal from her daughter and her boyfriend, so I played along, ""I actually need a moment more, if you don't mind?""

The nurse gave me a stern look, and gestured past me, ""Bathroom is just down there.""

I followed her direction, entering the bathroom, and closing the door behind me. I sat on the toilet, listening for indication that the nurse was returning downstairs. She seemed to listen in on me for a while through the door, but eventually respected my need for privacy. I heard her footsteps become more and more echoey, and seeming to come from lower down, so I knew she was gone.

I softly made my way back across the landing, and spied through the bedroom door to watch the young man fucking the young woman from behind, plunging his cock between her legs. I reached between my legs, and simulated his strokes with my fingers, which made me tingle throughout my body, and my mind imagined being in her place.

In those moments, I was in heavenly ecstasy, caught up in the throes of young love. I was wrapped up in what I saw, and down there was wrapped up in my hands, fidgeting and plunging in sympathy with my observations. It felt surreal, and wonderful, and natural, and I urged myself right to the edge of satisfaction along with the young woman...

I must've lost my balance, because I stumbled through the door to a breathless scream, and quiet shyness as the young couple shielded themselves with the sheets surrounding them. The sweet surrender on their faces was now urgent horror, and I suddenly felt incredibly ashamed.

The young woman found her breath enough to ask, ""What's happening?""

I pulled my hands from my crotch, and brushed my hair shyly, explaining, ""I was just coming to say thanks for all your help.""

The young man said, ""You're welcome. Now, do you mind?""

I saw the distress from the young couple, and didn't want them to raise alarm by calling for the nurse, so I urged them, ""Please? Let me just sit in and watch? I'll be quiet, I swear; and you won't even know I'm here. How often does this happen?""

I saw the shock on the young couple's faces, but the young girl rolled her eyes, pulling her boyfriend back onto her, and inviting me, ""Fine... You do what you need to, then leave.""

I was in!

I couldn't believe my ears!

I couldn't believe my eyes!

I was watching, up-close, a young couple entangling and entwining each other with raw emotion, and I was loving it. Collapsed on a beanbag chair in the corner, I buried my fingers deep as I buried deeper into the beans, allowing things to happen as they emerge.

The young woman took the lead in her playfulness, urging her boyfriend to relax with her. He was stiff and embarrassed by my presence, but she wormed her way on top of him, coaxing him out of his shell. She looked so long and lanky, and her thin body undulated to receive his renewed passion from underneath.

I would like to say the young woman reminded me of myself when I was that age, starting to think about college, and work, and boys, but I've never been that beautiful, and I've never been that playful. She was so assured of herself as she asserted her body.

I was riding on the edge of orgasm for a while, and feeling like I wanted it to last all day long, but the young couple were winding up as I watched them race towards their climax. I had to hurry myself along to meet their end so I could take my leave.

As the young couple collapsed with each other, curled up in their sheets, I stood over them, fixing my clothes as I said, ""Thanks for everything you've done for me,"" before returning downstairs.

The nurse noted upon my return, ""You're flushed and sweaty. Feeling alright?""

I found my breath enough to say, ""I'll be fine,"" and hastily left, eager to return home.

My heart is still racing!

I still don't really know how it happened, but it was so invigorating. I got on the phone to Hershey, telling him all about it, and he got himself off as I told him.

He said to me, ""Babe, that's some really creepy shit, but I gotta respect the hustle. You got in there, and you got out. Next time we're together, I'm gonna treat you so bad for being a bad bitch out there.""

I heard him. Hershey was right; I was really creepy, and, I was a bad girl, and...

Yeah...

""That Tetsuo guy, the one who's in the Kendo club--I heard he confessed to you.""

""Whuh? Oh, not this again."" Kobayashi Mina, a childhood friend of mine since elementary and now a fellow ninth-grader, sighed exasperatedly, already knowing where I was going with this.

""What do you mean, 'again'?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow at her.

""Yeah, he confessed to me, so what?"" she shot back, her voice oozing with annoyance. ""Not like I'm going to accept him anyway.""

""Sounds like another day in the office.""

""Tell me about it..."" she said, slouching down as we continued to walk home. ""Why do you always ask about the guys who confess to me, by the way? Genuine question.""

I looked away, avoiding her gaze as she asked that. ""No reason.""

""I know when you're lying, Jun,"" she teased, then promptly pinched the side of my waist.

""Ow, hey!""

""Spill the beans, or no more copying my Algebra homework for you!""

""Alright, relax!"" I yelled, holding her at arm's length to keep her from elbowing me again. ""I just wanna make sure they like you for all the right reasons.""

""Right reasons?""

""Oh, y-you know what I'm talking about,"" I mumbled, trying not to make it too obvious I was referring to her chest. ""Puberty has been kind to you... is all I'm gonna say.""

I then gestured vaguely at her. ""I mean, we're only in ninth grade, right? And you've already got guys falling over themselves for you."" I paused, my voice trailing off at that last bit as I scratched my neck nervously.

""I just... I'd rather you be with someone who likes you for who you are.""

She blinked at me, her cheeks turning rosy pink as my words were made clear in her mind. ""E-Eh? Mmm, w-well I guess you have a point there."" The way her expression shifted was amusing, almost comical, even.

""Exactly. The last thing we need is you getting with a guy who only likes you for your assets, if you catch my drift.""

""Sounds like something you'd do.""

""Dead wrong there, sister,"" I retorted, slightly offended she'd even suggest that. ""I've known you longer than I've known myself.""

""Is that right? Does that mean you can qualify as my boyfriend?""

It took a while for me to answer, my mind racing as I debated whether to seize the opportunity that had just presented itself. My heart pounded, and I felt my hands turn clammy with sweat. The weight of the moment pressed down on me like a sack of bricks, while my mind was a whirlwind of emotions.

Should I take it? I'm gonna take it--it's either now or never...

""Jun? Hey.""

""Can I... qualify as your boyfriend?"" I repeated her question back to her, my voice shaking slightly.

""Oh, I was just--""

""Well... what if I want to, would that be alright with you?"" I blurted, the words coming out before I could even process them. My face burned, though I had no regrets.

Stunned silence followed. We both stopped in our tracks, letting the weight of my words slowly sink in. Mina lingered a handful of steps behind me, and I was too wrought with anxiety to even face her.

""...Turn around, Jun,"" she ordered, her tone firm and absolute.

I took a deep breath, braced myself in case her answer was a rejection, and turned to her as she asked.

Huh...?

What I saw on her face was a familiar shit-eating grin, not the stone-cold expression I had expected. It was the sort she'd flash when she caught me doing something incriminating and was now planning to use it as blackmail.

""Eeeeehh, what the hell was that?"" she asked, her voice sounding like she was one bad joke away from howling in laughter.

""W... What was what?""

""Pfffhh, even that nerd from Class 3-3 had a much better way of proclaiming his love,"" she then stepped closer, placing her hand on my nose. ""Oh well, it's not every day your best friend confesses to you.""

""Yeah? Wait, so you...""

I couldn't finish my sentence; she had a finger on my lips before I could complete it.

""Mm-hhmm,"" she nodded, her grin softening into something warmer as she grabbed my arm and gently hugged it close. ""Took you long enough, though.""

""I-It's not easy having to do it, just so you know.""

""I can imagine that. Well, whatever, let's get back to your place. We've got, like, six homework assignments to do.""

""You got it, chief,"" I replied, grinning like mad despite myself. ""As your boyfriend, my first order of business is to let me copy all of it.""

""You can keep dreaming, lover boy.""

With that, we resumed walking, with Mina now at my side, hugging my arm tightly. Her warmth against me was incredibly comforting, and for the first time since I could remember, I felt a weight get taken off my shoulders...

""You're... squeezing my arm between your breasts, by the way.""

""Oh? I thought you'd be enjoying it.""

""Well, if I'm being honest, yes.""

""Perv~ ♡""

...like a fog that had finally been lifted.

===============================

Act I

It's been almost a decade since Jun and I became lovers, yet it felt like it was only yesterday. Sweet memories from a time when we were so innocent, naive, and carefree.

For as long as I could remember, I had promised myself to always cherish his love for me.

No matter what hardships might come our way.

===============================

A year after we graduated from college, Jun and I got married. Those four years I'd poured into a culinary arts degree now felt like a pointless endeavor. Jun's doing well for himself, having landed a job as a software developer some months prior.

As for me, I spend most of my days writing erotica, taking commissions online whenever I'm not actively looking for work related to my field.

'You're too talented to not get noticed', Jun says. 'You'll figure it out--you always do!' His words constantly in my mind as a constant reminder of my predicament. I know he means well, and that he's just trying to be supportive, but there are times where I wish he would just keep his mouth shut.

""Long face again, dear?"" Mom piped up, taking me out of my headspace momentarily. We were both in the kitchen, me taking a coffee break and her trying to pack what looked to be pill bottles into her purse.

Dressed to the nines, she looked like a cougar on her way to bed the first young man she sees. To her credit, she pulled off that dongtan dress like she was born to wear it, despite already being in her late thirties.

Explains why I'd catch Jun stealing glances at her every now and again.

""Where you off to now?"" I asked, dodging her question. ""Off with yet another guy? I thought you and James already tied the knot.""

""Got married, we did~"" Mom replied, slinging her purse all the way to her shoulder with a cheeky smile on her face. ""But become exclusive, we did not~""

Hmph, swinging. I couldn't think of a more hedonistic lifestyle short of full-blown polyamory. Whether it was James' influence, or if Mom was just reclaiming her youth after years of widowhood, I couldn't say. Probably a bit of both.

""Right...""

""Don't worry about feeling lonely, hun. James will hold the fort with you here while I'm out."" And with that, Mom was out the door, off to meet her next lay of the week.

James Vilhelmsen.

A man of Danish descent--blonde, well-built, and more than a little wealthy. All the sleazy traits that would turn women's heads without him so much as trying. He met my mom at a swinger's club, married her, and now he, for some reason, is content living under the same roof as us.

This is despite the fact that he's a shareholder of several major businesses and the CEO of the firm Jun currently works at.

~~

The first time they met was at a company dinner, a sort of welcoming party for all the fresh recruits. With James being the CEO of that particular firm, I suppose it was only natural for him to be the center of attention. Ever the charmer, he made sure to introduce himself to Jun, glass of wine in hand and with a smile that could disarm anyone.

""Ah, you're Jun, right?"" he said, extending his hand. ""I've heard quite a lot about you. Mina's a lucky woman, I'll just say that now."" Mom laughed heartily at his remark, but I didn't find it quite as funny.

Jun, ever polite, shook his hand and smiled back. ""Yes, thank you, sir. Err, you must be Saeko's new husband--it's nice to meet you, too.""

James chuckled, his tone light-hearted and casual but with an edge that only I seemed to notice. ""Please, we're all practically family now, aren't we? No need for formalities.""

Jun nodded with a grin, oblivious to the way James' eyes lingered on me longer than was necessary.

""Jun, come with me,"" James said, clapping him gently on the shoulder. ""Since you're my, err, new stepdaughter's new husband, I'll personally show you the ropes of how we do things around here.""

With that, he led my husband away, leaving me alone with Mom who was flirting with a bunch of other guests at our table.

~~

That man...

'...Mina's a lucky woman...'

...to think he'd find me again.

""Hey, Mina. Still awake?"" Speak of the devil. ""Where's Saeko?"" James asked as he shuffled downstairs half-asleep, his deep, baritone voice piercing through the silence.

""I thought you'd know."" I replied without missing a beat.

""Mmm... ah yes! Ha, slipped my mind,"" he chuckled as he sat beside me, beer can in hand after having taken one from the fridge. ""So, what're you up to? How's your novel going?""

""Swimmingly. Not much to report."" I shrugged, keeping my tone neutral.

He then fell silent after that. 'Finally some peace and quiet', I thought--until I felt the sensation of his knuckle softly tracing my face. I flinched, leaning back out of reflex, but it wasn't enough to break contact.

""J-James, stop--""

""You grew out of your slut phase, alright,"" he said bluntly while taking a sip of his beer. ""Too bad you couldn't grow out of being a terrible liar.""

""I said stop,"" I hissed, swatting his hand away with more force than was necessary. He didn't put up a struggle, but that insufferable smug look on his face remained, like he knew exactly how much it drove me up the wall. ""For the life of me, I can't figure out what my mom sees in you, you're such a sleaze.""

""Rich, fit, great in bed--everything Mommy dearest could ever ask for,"" he replied as he leaned closer, his breath that stunk of booze permeating my nostrils. ""You of all people should know that.""

""D-Don't know what you're talking about...""

""Don't pretend like we haven't met before,"" his whispers became louder as he got even closer, his breath tickling my ear with every word that he spoke.

""Get off me...""

""Yeah, I believe we have. Kobayashi 'I can't live without this cock anymore' Mina."" Those words of his were like keys turning in a lock, unearthing memories I'd tried so hard to repress. I had said those words, alright...

""You thought I'd forget, didn't you?""

...and look where it had gotten me.

""James... get off of me. I won't ask again."" I snapped with a firm, almost angry tone. He backed off right away, holding up one hand in the air in mock surrender while still displaying that awful smirk.

""Alright, sweetie, you're the boss.""

""And just so you know, my name is *Sunohara* Mina.""

I got up before he could try anything else, then practically raced upstairs to the bedroom that Jun and I shared, not even bothering to take my half-finished coffee with me. I threw myself on our bed and laid there for what felt like hours, staring at the ceiling while my chest felt tight with frustration.

Not at James, but at myself.

Resist harder. You have a husband, you're married. Don't let that demon drag you back into his claws...

===============================

I spent the next hour hunched in front of my PC, trying to claw out every last bit of creativity out of my head. Yet the harder I tried, the more disjointed my ideas became, leaving behind a messy pile of useless, lifeless scraps that made me want to shriek. When I finally skimmed through what I'd written, I slumped over on my desk, groaning in exhaustion, frustration and defeat.

Writer's block had reared its ugly head once more, and with it came the crushing weight of my inadequacy.

""Think of something... think of something, think, think, think..."" I murmured, gently banging my head against the desk after every word. ""You weren't like this when you first started writing.""

Before my thoughts could progress any further, I heard the door swing open. It was James, barging into the room like he owned the place.

""...What're you doing here?""

""Settle down, I'm just here to give you this,' he said as held up my phone. ""You left it on the table earlier.""

""Alright, just hand it over and then go.""

James extended the item to me, but just as I was about to reach for it, he yanked it back, his lips curling into his trademark devil smirk that swiftly turned my confusion to anger. Almost immediately, I glared at him, my patience already stretched thin at that point.

""Ah, ah, ah. Not so fast.""

""James,"" I snapped through clenched teeth, then stood up and walked over to him. ""Give it to me. Now.""

""C'mon Mina, is that any way to talk to your new daddy?"" he taunted me as he held my phone up just barely out of my reach, teasing me with it like it was a carrot on a stick. ""Learn to be more grateful, please.""

It was a form of mockery that I no longer had the patience for.

""Give it back!"" I lunged at him and tried clawing for the phone myself, but he was too tall, too strong. A minor scuffle between us broke out, one that ended with him tightly wrapping his arm around my shoulder in a suffocating embrace while his mocking, condescending laughter echoed in my ears.

""What the--let me go! James!""

""Easy there, I just have something to show you real quick."" I struggled vainly in his grasp, clawing and scratching at his skin, until I saw what it was that he wanted me to see.

It was a photo of me and him together, taken years back. We were on a hotel bed, its sheets soaked to a point that the wet spots outnumbered the dry ones. Countless condoms littered the floor and the bed itself, all used and filled with an unmistakable white fluid.

I was in James' arms while we both sat on the bed, sporting a half-asleep smile while practically caked in his semen--from my hair down to my crotch, where most of his load had pooled. He held the phone in one hand, the front cam capturing this licentious scene while he smirked at the lens, his arm wrapped possessively around my shoulders.

""I was wondering why you still had this,"" he whispered, his voice smooth and teasing.

""W...Wait, no--""

""Can't say I blame you, though,"" he continued, his warm, yet oddly minty breath tickling my earlobe. ""In those five months, you were the happiest you've ever been.""

""Shut up, t-that's not true...""

""That being said, I wonder too if Jun is privy to any of this.""

My heart immediately sank hearing him mention my husband's name.

""Don't bring him into this mess!"" I yelled at him, now seething with fury. I had done everything to keep this a secret from my dear Jun, ever since I ended my relationship with this sleazy prick. In my head, as long as I never made another mistake like it again, there was no harm in keeping Jun in the dark.

""Why not? He's your hubby, isn't he?"" he said as he pinched the photo on my phone and zoomed in on my smiling face, as if to disparage me. ""It'd be a shame if he finds out what you've been up to when you were a freshman.""

I couldn't take it anymore. I lunged for the phone one last time in a desperate bid to erase that stain of a photo. He saw my attempt coming from miles away and promptly stopped it cold--with the same hand he was holding my device with. He didn't even flinch, as if my struggle was little more than an inconvenience to him.

""Bad girl~""

""Nmh, s-screw you...!""

My phone was right there, in his clutch, mere inches from my grasp. The thought of it being so close, yet so far nearly brought me to tears.

I swallowed hard, then with a tight chest forced my words out in a trembling whisper. ""What... do you want from me?""

""What do I want from you?""

It's then that he began to gently guide me to the bed, still with a firm grasp around me. I made no further attempts at resisting at this point, rationalizing to myself that this will all end the moment James gets what he wants. Once we were seated together, he set my phone aside, far from where I could reach it.

""Don't act like you don't know, baby,"" he said as he traced his knuckles on my cheek once more, sending a cold, frigid shiver down my spine.

He then wasted little time taking my top off, lowering its spaghetti-thin straps until my chest was fully exposed, the cool air a sharp contrast to the heat that his hands gave off. His fingers brushed against my shoulders first, as if chewing the sight that was in front of him, before moving his hands to my collarbone, then my sternum, and finally, my breasts themselves, each of his hands holding a firm grasp.

""After all,"" he positioned himself behind me once he was done, his hands now copping a firm grip on my breasts as if he was kneading dough. ""You always loved playing this game more than I did.""

""S...Shut up..."" I blurted out a response in between labored breaths, all while trying to hold in my moans. ""Just get this... mnhh, over with.""

""You're definitely Saeko's daughter,"" he snickered in between soft strokes with his fingers. ""Equally sized tits, equally tight cunts. Yes, your mom has quite the vice between her legs, I'll just say that now.""

I clenched my fist hearing those perverted words come out of his mouth. Him assaulting me like this was bad enough, the least he could do was keep that annoying trap of his shut.

""P-Please, just, mfhm... shut up--ah!""

I bit my lower lip as soon as he started toying with my nipples, tweaking and tugging on them in ways I haven't felt in a long time. I couldn't help myself--I held his wrists right as my groin began to feel warm, heat rising from my core fast enough to make me squeeze my thighs.

He didn't show any reaction somehow, and just kept on playing with me as if my hands weren't gripping him at all.

""You know you're free to moan, right?"" he said while he held my lips and softly parted them open with his fingers. ""Sing for me, sweetie. I miss hearing you mewl like a slut in heat.""

""G-Go fuck your--aghh, ahhha...""

""Watch your language.""

His movements soon increased in intensity, and I found my resolve wearing thin with each second that he spent exploring every inch of my chest. My hands moved over to his thighs where I gripped his legs doing my best to retain my composure despite it slowly becoming a losing battle.

Focus... focus, you can't let him win. He'll get bored eventually, you just have to endu--

""Niinhmm!!""

I was in the midst of trying to calm my racing thoughts, when James took advantage, sliding his hand down my shorts where his fingers pushed with a force that left my legs trembling. I squealed, and immediately tried to pry his arm off of me, but that went as well as you'd expect.

""J-James...! Not that spot!"" I yelped.

""There's that voice,"" he whispered with a weird, yet soothing tenderness in his tone. ""A little louder for daddy, please.""

Exhausted, both physically and mentally, and with a flurry of sensations flaring inside my crotch, I finally let my voice loose. As he dug and stirred deep into my aching depths, I wailed with equal ferocity. Each stroke, each rub, my voice flowed incessantly, free from my control.

""Gnhh, aahha... n-no, mhhh!""

My hips shook and bucked against his hand and my fingers clawed at the bedsheets, desperate for either a stop or a release from the conflict of sensations that coursed throughout my body.

""That's it. Sing to your heart's content, baby,"" He continued to whisper, now going in for an occasional kiss on the neck that only served to torment me even further.",,2025-08-15T19:22:31.471638,3559,
