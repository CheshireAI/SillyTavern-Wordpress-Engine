# Credit System Fix - Order Completion Issue

## Problem Description

The credit system was not automatically adding credits when orders were completed with credit products. Credits were only being added when manually activating orders from the admin settings page.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **WooCommerce hook registration timing**:

1. **Early Hook Registration**: WooCommerce hooks were being registered in the constructor of the `PMV_Subscription_System` class, which runs immediately when the class is included (line 107 in `png-metadata-viewer.php`).

2. **WooCommerce Not Ready**: At this point, WooCommerce might not be fully loaded, causing the hooks to not work properly.

3. **Double Registration**: Hooks were being registered both in the constructor AND in the `register_woocommerce_hooks()` method, potentially causing conflicts.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Hook Registration Timing

- **Removed** WooCommerce hooks from the constructor
- **Moved** all WooCommerce hooks to the `register_woocommerce_hooks()` method
- **Added** fallback mechanism in the `init()` method to ensure hooks are registered

### 2. Enhanced Debugging

- **Added** `test_woocommerce_hooks()` method to verify hook registration
- **Added** `debug_order_credit_processing()` method for detailed order analysis
- **Enhanced** logging in `handle_order_completion()` method

### 3. Admin Tools

- **Added** "Test WooCommerce Hooks" button in admin settings
- **Added** "Debug Order Credits" button for troubleshooting specific orders
- **Added** AJAX handlers for testing and debugging

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Test WooCommerce Hooks

1. Go to **Admin Settings** → **Credit System Configuration**
2. Click **"Test WooCommerce Hooks"** button
3. Check if all hooks are properly registered

### 2. Debug a Specific Order

1. Go to **Admin Settings** → **Credit System Configuration**
2. Enter an **Order ID** in the "Debug Order Credits" section
3. Click **"Debug Order"** button
4. Review the detailed information about the order

### 3. Test Order Completion

1. Create a test order with credit products
2. Complete the order (change status to "completed")
3. Check if credits are automatically added
4. If not, use the debug tools to identify the issue

## Technical Details

### Hook Registration Flow

1. **Plugin Load**: `PMV_Subscription_System` class is included
2. **Constructor**: Registers WordPress hooks (AJAX, init, etc.)
3. **WooCommerce Loaded**: `woocommerce_loaded` action fires
4. **Hook Registration**: `register_woocommerce_hooks()` method runs
5. **Fallback**: If hooks aren't registered by `init`, they're registered there

### Key Methods

- `register_woocommerce_hooks()`: Registers all WooCommerce hooks and filters
- `test_woocommerce_hooks()`: Verifies hook registration status
- `debug_order_credit_processing()`: Analyzes specific orders for debugging
- `handle_order_completion()`: Main handler for order completion events

## Troubleshooting

### If Credits Still Aren't Added Automatically

1. **Check Hook Registration**: Use "Test WooCommerce Hooks" button
2. **Debug Specific Order**: Use "Debug Order Credits" button
3. **Check Error Logs**: Look for "PMV:" prefixed messages
4. **Verify Product Setup**: Ensure credit products have proper meta fields

### Common Issues

1. **WooCommerce Not Active**: Check if WooCommerce plugin is enabled
2. **Hook Priority**: Some themes/plugins might interfere with hook priorities
3. **Order Status**: Ensure order status is set to "completed" or "processing"
4. **User Authentication**: Credits only work for logged-in users (not guest orders)

## Files Modified

- `includes/subscription-system.php`: Fixed hook registration timing
- `includes/admin-settings-ui.php`: Added debugging tools
- `includes/ajax-handlers.php`: Added AJAX handlers for testing

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] WooCommerce hooks are properly registered
- [ ] Credit products exist and have correct meta fields
- [ ] Order completion triggers credit addition
- [ ] Debug tools work correctly
- [ ] Manual credit processing works
- [ ] Error logging shows proper information

## Future Improvements

1. **Cron Job**: Add scheduled task to check for missed credit orders
2. **Webhook Support**: Add support for external payment processors
3. **Credit Expiration**: Implement credit expiration system
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk credit processing for multiple orders
