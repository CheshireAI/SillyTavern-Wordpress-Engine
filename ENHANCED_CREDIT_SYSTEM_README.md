# Enhanced Credit System - Automatic Order Processing

## Overview

The enhanced credit system addresses the issue where new orders were not automatically triggering credit additions. The system now provides multiple layers of protection to ensure that credits are processed immediately when orders go to "processing" or "completed" status.

## Problem Solved

**Previous Issue**: New orders were not automatically triggering credit additions, requiring manual intervention to process credits.

**Root Cause**: WooCommerce hooks were not firing consistently for new orders, or there were timing issues with hook registration.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-layered approach with enhanced hooks, immediate processing checks, and improved cron scheduling.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Multi-Layer Hook System

The system now registers hooks at multiple priorities and points in the order lifecycle:

- **Immediate Hooks (Priority 1)**: Fastest response for critical order events
- **Standard Hooks (Priority 5-10)**: Reliable processing for standard order events  
- **Comprehensive Hooks**: Maximum coverage for all order changes

#### Hook Coverage Includes:
- `woocommerce_order_status_changed` (multiple priorities)
- `woocommerce_order_status_processing` (immediate and standard)
- `woocommerce_order_status_completed` (immediate and standard)
- `woocommerce_payment_complete` (immediate and standard)
- `woocommerce_checkout_order_created` (immediate and standard)
- `woocommerce_new_order` (immediate and standard)
- `woocommerce_save_order` (comprehensive)
- `save_post` (comprehensive)
- `woocommerce_order_object_updated_props` (comprehensive)

### 2. Immediate Processing Check

**New Feature**: The system now checks for processing orders on every page load (init hook) to catch any orders that might have been missed by hooks.

- Runs automatically on every WordPress page load
- Checks orders from the last 24 hours
- Processes credits immediately for any missed orders
- Prevents performance issues by using static flag

### 3. Enhanced Cron Scheduling

**Improved**: Changed from hourly to 15-minute intervals for better responsiveness.

- Custom 15-minute cron schedule added
- Automatically schedules if not present
- Processes missed credits more frequently
- Better coverage for new orders

### 4. Manual Processing Tools

**New Admin Interface**: Added "Process New Orders" button for immediate manual processing.

- Processes orders from the last 2 hours
- Immediate credit processing for new orders
- Useful for testing and emergency processing
- Detailed results reporting

## How It Works

### Automatic Processing Flow

1. **Order Created**: Multiple hooks catch order creation at different points
2. **Status Change**: Hooks fire when order status changes to processing/completed
3. **Immediate Check**: System checks for processing orders on every page load
4. **Cron Backup**: 15-minute cron job processes any missed orders
5. **Credit Addition**: Credits are added immediately when detected

### Hook Priority System

```
Priority 1: Immediate processing (fastest response)
Priority 5: Standard processing (reliable)
Priority 10: Comprehensive processing (maximum coverage)
```

### Processing Logic

1. **Detect Order**: Hook fires when order status changes
2. **Validate Order**: Check if order contains credit products
3. **Check Status**: Verify order is in valid status (processing, completed, etc.)
4. **Process Credits**: Calculate and add credits based on order items
5. **Mark Processed**: Set flag to prevent duplicate processing
6. **Log Activity**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Admin Interface

### New Button: "Process New Orders"

Located in: **WordPress Admin → PNG Metadata Viewer → Subscriptions**

**Purpose**: Manually process credits for new orders that might not have been processed automatically.

**What It Does**:
- Checks orders from the last 2 hours
- Identifies orders with credit products

### New Feature: Credit Caps for Daily Rewards

**Location**: **WordPress Admin → PNG Metadata Viewer → Subscriptions → Daily Login Rewards**

**Purpose**: Limit the amount of free credits users can accumulate from daily login rewards.

**New Settings**:
- **Maximum Free Token Credits**: Cap on free token credits from daily rewards (default: 100,000)
- **Maximum Free Image Credits**: Cap on free image credits from daily rewards (default: 1,000)
- **Current User Free Credit Status**: Button to check current user's free credit status vs. caps

**How It Works**:
1. **Separate Tracking**: Free credits (daily rewards) are tracked separately from purchased credits
2. **Cap Enforcement**: When users reach the cap, they no longer receive daily rewards for that credit type
3. **Purchased Credits Unaffected**: Caps only apply to free daily rewards, not purchased credits
4. **Admin Control**: Admins can set caps to 0 for unlimited free credits, or any specific amount

**Benefits**:
- Prevents users from accumulating unlimited free credits
- Encourages credit purchases after reaching free limits
- Maintains fair usage across all users
- Configurable limits per credit type
- Processes credits for unprocessed orders
- Provides detailed results reporting

**When to Use**:
- After creating new orders
- If automatic processing seems delayed
- For testing credit system functionality
- Emergency credit processing

## Testing and Verification

### Run the Test Script

Use the provided test script to verify system functionality:

```bash
php test-enhanced-credit-system.php
```

**Test Coverage**:
1. Subscription system availability
2. WooCommerce hooks registration
3. Cron job scheduling
4. Immediate processing check
5. Manual new orders processing
6. Hook execution testing

### Expected Results

**All tests should pass**:
- ✓ Subscription system loaded successfully
- ✓ All WooCommerce hooks registered
- ✓ Cron job scheduled for 15-minute intervals
- ✓ Immediate processing check working
- ✓ Manual processing functional
- ✓ Hook execution successful

## Troubleshooting

### If New Orders Still Don't Process Automatically

1. **Check Hook Registration**:
   - Run the test script
   - Verify all hooks are registered
   - Check error logs for hook failures

2. **Verify Cron Job**:
   - Ensure cron job is scheduled
   - Check if cron is running (WordPress cron or system cron)
   - Verify 15-minute interval is working

3. **Check Order Status**:
   - Ensure orders are in valid status (processing, completed)
   - Verify orders contain credit products
   - Check product meta fields are correct

4. **Use Manual Processing**:
   - Use "Process New Orders" button for immediate processing
   - Check results for any errors
   - Verify credits are added successfully

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Hooks not firing
**Solution**: Check WooCommerce activation and hook registration

**Issue**: Cron job not running
